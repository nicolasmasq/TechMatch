finance,"What is Excel?Excel is a spreadsheet program from Microsoft and a component of its Office product group for business applications. Microsoft Excel enables users to format, organize and calculate data in a spreadsheet.By organizing data using software like Excel, data analysts and other users can make information easier to view as data is added or changed. Excel contains a large number of boxes called cells that are ordered in rows and columns. Data is placed in these cells. Excel is a part of the Microsoft Office and Office 365 suites and is compatible with other applications in the Office suite. The spreadsheet software is available for Windows, macOS, Android and iOS platforms.Common Excel use casesExcel is most commonly used in business settings. For example, it is used in business analysis, human resource management, operations management and performance reporting. Excel uses a large collection of cells formatted to organize and manipulate data and solve mathematical functions. Users can arrange data in the spreadsheet using graphing tools, pivot tables and formulas. The spreadsheet application also has a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications.Organizations use Microsoft Excel for the following:collection and verification of business data;business analysis;data entry and storage;data analysis;performance reporting;strategic analysis;accounting and budgeting;administrative and managerial management;account management;project management; andoffice administration.Excel terminology and componentsExcel has its own terminology for its components, which new users may not immediately find understandable. Some of these terms and components include the following:Cell. A user enters data into a cell, which is the intersection of a column and row. Cell reference. This is the set of coordinates where a cell is located. Rows are horizontal and numbered whereas columns are vertical and assigned a letter.Active cell. This is the currently selected cell, outlined by a green box.Workbook. This is an Excel file that contains one or more worksheets.Worksheet. These are the different documents nested within a Workbook.Worksheet tab. These are the tabs at the bottom left of the spreadsheet.Column and row headings. These are the numbered and lettered cells located just outside of the columns and rows. Selecting a header highlights the entire row or column.Formula. Formulas are mathematical equations, cell references or functions that can be placed inside a cell to produce a value. Formulas must start with an equal ""="" sign.Formula bar. This is the long input bar that is used to enter values or formulas in cells. It is located at the top of the worksheet, next to the ""fx"" label.Address bar. This bar located to the left of the formula bar shows the number and letter coordinates of an active cell. Filter. These are rules a user can employ to select what rows in a worksheet to display. This option is located on the top right of the home bar under ""Sort & Filter."" An auto filter option can be selected to show rows that match specific values.AutoFill. This feature enables users to copy data to more than one cell automatically. With two or more cells in a series, a user can select both cells and drag the bottom right corner down to autofill the rest of the cells.AutoSum. This feature enables users to add multiple values. Users can select the cells they want to add and press the Alt and Equal keys. There is also a button to enable this feature on the top right of the home page, above ""Fill"" and to the left of ""Sort & Filter.""PivotTable. This data summarization tool sorts and calculates data automatically. This is located under the insert tab on the far left.PivotChart. This chart acts as a visual aid to the PivotTable, providing graph representations of the data. It is located under the middle of the insert page, next to maps.Source data. This is the information that is used to create a PivotTable.Key aspects of Excel.This image shows key features of Excel.Advanced Excel capabilitiesMore advanced tools in Excel include the following:TREND function. This tool is used to calculate linear trend lines through a set of Y or X values. It can be used for time series trend analysis or projecting future trends. Trendlines can be used on charts.VLOOKUP. The Vertical Lookup, or VLOOKUP function, can be used to search for values in a larger data set and pull that data into a new table. VLOOKUP is a cell input command that looks like =VLOOKUP(). The parentheses include the data the user wants to look up, where to look for it, the column number with the value to return; or optionally, the user can specify an Approximate or Exact match indicated by True or False.Table Array. This is a combination of two or more tables with data and values linked and related to one another. This is part of VLOOKUP.Col_index_num. Another value when creating a table array that specifies the column from where data is being pulled.Range_lookup. This value in VLOOKUP provides information closest to what a user wants to find when nothing matches other variables. This is represented by a true or false label. False gives the exact value a user is looking for and True gives results from a variable data range.MAX and MIN functions. These functions provide the maximum and minimum values from selected data sets. MAX is used to find the maximum value in a function tab and MIN is used to find the minimum value.AND function. This function has more than one criteria set when searching variables. If a variable matches the criteria, the value will be returned as true; if not, it will be returned as false. The input for the function should look like this: =AND (logical1, [logical2], ...).Additional functions for use in Excel include subtract, multiply, divide, count, median, concatenate and other logical functions similar to AND, such as OR.Excel and XLS filesAn XLS file is a spreadsheet file that can be created by Excel or other spreadsheet programs. The file type represents an Excel Binary File format. An XLS file stores data as binary streams -- a compound file. Streams and substreams in the file contain information about the content and structure of an Excel workbook.Versions of Excel after Excel 2007 use XLSX files by default, since it is a more open and structured format. Later versions of Excel still support the creation and reading of XLS files, however. Workbook data can also be exported in formats including PDF, TXT, Hypertext markup language, XPS and XLSX.Macro-enabled Excel files use the XLSM file extension. In this case, macros are sets of instructions that automate Excel processes. XLSM files are similar to XLM files but are based on the Open XML format found in later Microsoft Office software.Excel competitorsEven though Excel might be one of the most recognizable spreadsheet programs, other vendors offer competing products. Examples include the following:Google Sheets. Google Sheets is a free competitor to Excel, with similar layouts and features. Users with a Gmail account can access Google Sheets. Google Sheets are saved in the cloud, meaning users can access their spreadsheets from anywhere and on numerous devices. Multiple users can also collaborate on the same spreadsheet.Numbers. Apple's spreadsheet program comes free with every Mac and provides prebuilt templates, charts and graphs. Numbers excels at graphics and charts, but it does not handle large data sets as well as Microsoft Excel. Numbers is also exclusive for Apple's devices. But it does enable users to save spreadsheets as Excel files, so a Windows user can still open a Numbers spreadsheet in Excel.Apache OpenOffice Calc. This free open source spreadsheet software features multiple user collaboration; natural language formulas that enable users to create formulas using words; DataPilot, which pulls data from corporate databases; and style and formatting features that enable different cell formatting options. The software uses a different macro programming language than Excel and has fewer chart options. OpenOffice Calc works on Windows and macOS platforms. OpenOffice Calc also uses the Open Document Format as its default, with only limited support for Microsoft's XLSX format.Microsoft Excel vs. Google Sheets.This image compares Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.History and future of ExcelMicrosoft released Excel in 1985 under the name Microsoft Multiplan. Microsoft's spreadsheet program competed with similar products at the time, including Lotus 1-2-3 from the Lotus Development Corp. Although Lotus 1-2-3 was reportedly the first spreadsheet to introduce cell names and macros, Multiplan used a graphical user interface and enabled users to point and click using a mouse. Multiplan made it easier to manipulate, process and view spreadsheet data.Initially, Multiplan lost popularity on Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS) systems when competing with Lotus 1-2-3. Two years after its initial release, in 1987, Microsoft introduced Excel version 2.0. By 1988, this new version, now on Windows platforms, began to outsell Lotus 1-2-3 and other similar spreadsheet programs.In 1990, Microsoft released version 3 of Excel, with features such as toolbars, 3D charts, and drawing and outlining capabilities. Version 4 came along two years later and added the auto-fill function. In 1993, version 5 of Excel was released. This version included Visual Basic for Applications macros, which enabled regular tasks to be automated.One of the next big updates to Excel was version 12, which was released in 2007. This update used a new Ribbon menu system. Improved functions included a SmartArt set of diagrams, better management of named variables and more flexibility for formatting graphs. Excel moved to using the more structured and open XLSX files as well. Version 15 released in 2013 included new tools such as Power View, Power Pivot and Flash Fill. This version also improved multithreading capabilities.The current version of Excel, version 16, was released in 2019. Since its conception, Microsoft Excel has become one of the most widely used business applications and is often paired with other Microsoft apps such as Word, Outlook and PowerPoint. Although Microsoft no longer updates Excel as different versions, it rolls out new features and updates automatically over time.Microsoft Excel is arguably one of the most popular spreadsheet applications and has long since played a role in businesses. However, with the popularity of other current spreadsheet software, Excel now has increased competition. The website askwonder.com claims that the collection of apps in Google Suite, which includes Google Sheets, is used by 2 billion users every month, whereas Microsoft Excel has an estimated 750 million to 1.2 billion monthly global users. Google and Microsoft do not publish monthly usage for either spreadsheet program, so it is difficult to estimate values.",Microsoft Excel
finance,"Excel is the hammer for too many businesses’ nailsExcel is a fine piece of software, but as Public Health England found out, its ubiquity and ease of use does not make it the ideal tool for every job that involves dataPublic Health England (PHE) has just given us another reminder of how Excel is the most dangerous software in the world. Not, I hasten to add, because there is anything particularly wrong with it, but rather because so many people use it, that something is simply bound to go wrong.This time around it was, apparently, falling foul of the xls format 65,535 rows limitation, which makes about as much sense to me, a writer and thus word person, as it did to PHE. The effect being those 16,000 unreported Covid-19 cases, and therefore the failure of any track-and-trace operations upon those people.Quite why a system costing us taxpayers £12bn is using Excel is just one of those things, really. To manage a database of results, perhaps a database could have been used, but again I’m outside the field looking in, not an expert.The point I would make, though, is that errors like this are not rare – or not rare enough, at least. From the financial markets, we have the tale of the London Whale. This was JP Morgan playing the Big I Am with tens of billions of dollars. Unfortunately, they were modelling their position using a series of Excel spreadsheets.Not even linked, the macros, the equations were being cut and pasted over from one to t’other. Not all of them made it accurately, which was a problem. For if what is being played is the price of risk, then your connections between the amount and the price of risk do need to be correct. Some $6bn was lost on this in the end. Which, even for a bank of that size, is real money.It is also possible to enjoy the EuSpRiG list of disasters – errors, perhaps, some of them – caused by the inappropriate use of spreadsheets.Appropriate technologyThis is, believe it or not, a symptom of the same complaint that many development experts have about poor places. That we should use appropriate technology for the case at hand. The specific examples here are of the importation of some higher technology that doesn’t have the necessary support mechanisms – say, diesel-run irrigation pumps in a place that doesn’t have a secure supply of either the fuel or the spare parts.Perhaps the screw that Archimedes worked out 2,500 years ago is a better solution in such places? Or, another example, that integrated steel plant that every ex-colonial nation seemed to think was essential – in places without ore, coal or limestone – or the demand for that much metal, either.People are simply using the wrong technology for the task at hand – that’s the similarity here. But that’s what makes diesel pumps dangerous in the same way that Excel is. And it’s that second that is the serious risk, simply because of how widespread the installation base is.You IT experts will know better than I what the correct solution to PHE’s problem was. Something in Python, perhaps, or at least the use of VBA. Possibly even a proper database, rather than a spreadsheet. But everyone has the spreadsheet on their corporate machine – surely that means that this is what should be used? Well, no, that is to say that if everyone has a hammer, then everything is a nail, which isn’t how to run matters. It is how to bodge them, but not how to run them.Read more about economics and ITWhat if we find we rather like this working from home thing?Our data is making us “richer” – even if it’s the tech companies getting rich.Could regulation kill Facebook completely?A spreadsheet, whether Visicalc, Lotus or Excel, allows something that was never really possible before about the starting date of 1980 – significant exploration of variances in numerical models. It is no exaggeration to say that modern financial markets simply wouldn’t be possible without the ability to do that. Depending on your view of how those markets work out, this might be a good or a bad thing.But what couldn’t be done before, not with ease, was to make a model, then run it, change one or other variable – or the relationship between them – then run it again. And again, and so explore the entire modelling space to see what might happen. Used for what they are good at, spreadsheets are a marvellous innovation.Alternative pathwaysThere is space in complex modelling like JP Morgan’s – which is to explore what might happen if... And then, once the relationships have been worked out, to encode into something more serious for the actual operating calculation of the markets and or the position. Equally, the use of Excel to think about how to tot up testing results by PHE is just fine. That’s what the innovation is for, to be able to test “what ifs” and alternative pathways. But once the working out has been done, the production system needs to be – as those 16,000 reasons tell us – encoded into something more robust.Which is where our similarity with Archimedes comes in – that appropriate technology. A spreadsheet is, or at least should be, a prototyping tool. That the vast series of calculations that accompany the exploration of the possibility space are more or less automated now allows the exploration of more spaces in more detail. This is excellent; it’s an advance.But that’s what the tech is appropriate for. Once the probabilities have been explored, it is time to put away the exploratory tool and adopt the production one. As with the geologist hacking at rocks with a pick and hammer to see what they are, but the miner upgrades to a shovel to actually move them.That is, good computing doesn’t allow anyone to use Excel to actually do anything, even though it’s an excellent tool to find out what to do. This is equally true about good computing from the technical side of specifying it, or the management side of agreeing what to pay for to do it.Yes, it is entirely true that everyone already has the spreadsheet, the Excel. But this is the same thinking as the man who only has a hammer – the difficulty being that there really are things that are better screwed than nailed.",Microsoft Excel
finance,"Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS and iPadOS. It features calculation or computation capabilities, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Excel forms part of the Microsoft 365 suite of software.FeaturesBasic operationMain article: SpreadsheetMicrosoft Excel has the basic features of all spreadsheets,[7] using a grid of cells arranged in numbered rows and letter-named columns to organize data manipulations like arithmetic operations. It has a battery of supplied functions to answer statistical, engineering, and financial needs. In addition, it can display data as line graphs, histograms and charts, and with a very limited three-dimensional graphical display. It allows sectioning of data to view its dependencies on various factors for different perspectives (using pivot tables and the scenario manager).[8] A PivotTable is a tool for data analysis. It does this by simplifying large data sets via PivotTable fields. It has a programming aspect, Visual Basic for Applications, allowing the user to employ a wide variety of numerical methods, for example, for solving differential equations of mathematical physics,[9][10] and then reporting the results back to the spreadsheet. It also has a variety of interactive features allowing user interfaces that can completely hide the spreadsheet from the user, so the spreadsheet presents itself as a so-called application, or decision support system (DSS), via a custom-designed user interface, for example, a stock analyzer,[11] or in general, as a design tool that asks the user questions and provides answers and reports.[12][13] In a more elaborate realization, an Excel application can automatically poll external databases and measuring instruments using an update schedule,[14] analyze the results, make a Word report or PowerPoint slide show, and e-mail these presentations on a regular basis to a list of participants. Excel was not designed to be used as a database.[citation needed]Microsoft allows for a number of optional command-line switches to control the manner in which Excel starts.FunctionsSee also: Microsoft Power FxExcel 2016 has 484 functions.[16] Of these, 360 existed prior to Excel 2010. Microsoft classifies these functions into 14 categories. Of the 484 current functions, 386 may be called from VBA as methods of the object ""WorksheetFunction""[17] and 44 have the same names as VBA functions.With the introduction of LAMBDA, Excel became Turing complete.Macro programmingVBA programmingMain article: Visual Basic for ApplicationsUse of a user-defined function sq(x) in Microsoft Excel. The named variables x & y are identified in the Name Manager. The function sq is introduced using the Visual Basic editor supplied with Excel.Subroutine in Excel calculates the square of named column variable x read from the spreadsheet, and writes it into the named column variable y.The Windows version of Excel supports programming through Microsoft's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which is a dialect of Visual Basic. Programming with VBA allows spreadsheet manipulation that is awkward or impossible with standard spreadsheet techniques. Programmers may write code directly using the Visual Basic Editor (VBE), which includes a window for writing code, debugging code, and code module organization environment. The user can implement numerical methods as well as automating tasks such as formatting or data organization in VBA[20] and guide the calculation using any desired intermediate results reported back to the spreadsheet.VBA was removed from Mac Excel 2008, as the developers did not believe that a timely release would allow porting the VBA engine natively to Mac OS X. VBA was restored in the next version, Mac Excel 2011,[21] although the build lacks support for ActiveX objects, impacting some high level developer tools.[22]A common and easy way to generate VBA code is by using the Macro Recorder.[23] The Macro Recorder records actions of the user and generates VBA code in the form of a macro. These actions can then be repeated automatically by running the macro. The macros can also be linked to different trigger types like keyboard shortcuts, a command button or a graphic. The actions in the macro can be executed from these trigger types or from the generic toolbar options. The VBA code of the macro can also be edited in the VBE. Certain features such as loop functions and screen prompt by their own properties, and some graphical display items, cannot be recorded but must be entered into the VBA module directly by the programmer. Advanced users can employ user prompts to create an interactive program, or react to events such as sheets being loaded or changed.Macro Recorded code may not be compatible with Excel versions. Some code that is used in Excel 2010 cannot be used in Excel 2003. Making a Macro that changes the cell colors and making changes to other aspects of cells may not be backward compatible.VBA code interacts with the spreadsheet through the Excel Object Model,[24] a vocabulary identifying spreadsheet objects, and a set of supplied functions or methods that enable reading and writing to the spreadsheet and interaction with its users (for example, through custom toolbars or command bars and message boxes). User-created VBA subroutines execute these actions and operate like macros generated using the macro recorder, but are more flexible and efficient.HistoryFrom its first version Excel supported end-user programming of macros (automation of repetitive tasks) and user-defined functions (extension of Excel's built-in function library). In early versions of Excel, these programs were written in a macro language whose statements had formula syntax and resided in the cells of special-purpose macro sheets (stored with file extension .XLM in Windows.) XLM was the default macro language for Excel through Excel 4.0.[25] Beginning with version 5.0 Excel recorded macros in VBA by default but with version 5.0 XLM recording was still allowed as an option. After version 5.0 that option was discontinued. All versions of Excel, including Excel 2021, are capable of running an XLM macro, though Microsoft discourages their use.[26]Python programmingIn 2023 Microsoft announced Excel would support the Python programming language directly.[27][28] As of January 2024, Python in Excel is available in the Microsoft 365 Insider Program.[27]ChartsGraph made using Microsoft ExcelExcel supports charts, graphs, or histograms generated from specified groups of cells. It also supports Pivot Charts that allow for a chart to be linked directly to a Pivot table. This allows the chart to be refreshed with the Pivot Table. The generated graphic component can either be embedded within the current sheet or added as a separate object.These displays are dynamically updated if the content of cells changes. For example, suppose that the important design requirements are displayed visually; then, in response to a user's change in trial values for parameters, the curves describing the design change shape, and their points of intersection shift, assisting the selection of the best design.Add-insAdditional features are available using add-ins. Several are provided with Excel, including:Analysis ToolPak: Provides data analysis tools for statistical and engineering analysis (includes analysis of variance and regression analysis)Analysis ToolPak VBA: VBA functions for Analysis ToolPakEuro Currency Tools: Conversion and formatting for euro currencySolver Add-In: Tools for optimization and equation solvingData storage and communicationNumber of rows and columnsVersions of Excel up to 7.0 had a limitation in the size of their data sets of 16K (214 = 16384) rows. Versions 8.0 through 11.0 could handle 64K (216 = 65536) rows and 256 columns (28 as label 'IV'). Version 12.0 onwards, including the current Version 16.x, can handle over 1M (220 = 1048576) rows, and 16384 (214, labeled as column 'XFD')File formatsExcel SpreadsheetFilename extension .xls, (.xlsx, .xlsm, .xlsb - Excel 2007)Internet media type application/vnd.ms-excelUniform Type Identifier (UTI) com.microsoft.excel.xlsDeveloped by MicrosoftType of format SpreadsheetUp until the 2007 version, Microsoft Excel used a proprietary binary file format called Excel Binary File Format (.XLS) as its primary format.[30] Excel 2007 uses Office Open XML as its primary file format, an XML-based format that followed after a previous XML-based format called ""XML Spreadsheet"" (""XMLSS""), first introduced in Excel 2002.[31]Although supporting and encouraging the use of new XML-based formats as replacements, Excel 2007 remained backwards-compatible with the traditional, binary formats. In addition, most versions of Microsoft Excel can read CSV, DBF, SYLK, DIF, and other legacy formats. Support for some older file formats was removed in Excel 2007.[32] The file formats were mainly from DOS-based programs.BinaryOpenOffice.org has created documentation of the Excel format. Two epochs of the format exist: the 97-2003 OLE format, and the older stream format. Microsoft has made the Excel binary format specification available to freely download.[34]Using other Windows applicationsWindows applications such as Microsoft Access and Microsoft Word, as well as Excel can communicate with each other and use each other's capabilities. The most common is Dynamic Data Exchange: although strongly deprecated by Microsoft, this is a common method to send data between applications running on Windows, with official MS publications referring to it as ""the protocol from hell"".[36] As the name suggests, it allows applications to supply data to others for calculation and display. It is very common in financial markets, being used to connect to important financial data services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.OLE Object Linking and Embedding allows a Windows application to control another to enable it to format or calculate data. This may take on the form of ""embedding"" where an application uses another to handle a task that it is more suited to, for example a PowerPoint presentation may be embedded in an Excel spreadsheet or vice versa.Using external dataExcel users can access external data sources via Microsoft Office features such as (for example) .odc connections built with the Office Data Connection file format. Excel files themselves may be updated using a Microsoft supplied ODBC driver.Excel can accept data in real-time through several programming interfaces, which allow it to communicate with many data sources such as Bloomberg and Reuters (through addins such as Power Plus Pro).DDE: ""Dynamic Data Exchange"" uses the message passing mechanism in Windows to allow data to flow between Excel and other applications. Although it is easy for users to create such links, programming such links reliably is so difficult that Microsoft, the creators of the system, officially refer to it as ""the protocol from hell"".[36] In spite of its many issues DDE remains the most common way for data to reach traders in financial markets.Network DDE Extended the protocol to allow spreadsheets on different computers to exchange data. Starting with Windows Vista, Microsoft no longer supports the facility.[41]Real Time Data: RTD although in many ways technically superior to DDE, has been slow to gain acceptance, since it requires non-trivial programming skills, and when first released was neither adequately documented nor supported by the major data vendors.[42][43]Alternatively, Microsoft Query provides ODBC-based browsing within Microsoft Excel.[44][45][46]Export and migration of spreadsheetsProgrammers have produced APIs to open Excel spreadsheets in a variety of applications and environments other than Microsoft Excel. These include opening Excel documents on the web using either ActiveX controls, or plugins like the Adobe Flash Player. The Apache POI opensource project provides Java libraries for reading and writing Excel spreadsheet files.Other platformsExcel for mobileExcel Mobile is a spreadsheet program that can edit XLSX files. It can edit and format text in cells, calculate formulas, search within the spreadsheet, sort rows and columns, freeze panes, filter the columns, add comments, and create charts. It cannot add columns or rows except at the edge of the document, rearrange columns or rows, delete rows or columns, or add spreadsheet tabs.[50][51][52][53][54][55] The 2007 version has the ability to use a full-screen mode to deal with limited screen resolution, as well as split panes to view different parts of a worksheet at one time.[53] Protection settings, zoom settings, autofilter settings, certain chart formatting, hidden sheets, and other features are not supported on Excel Mobile, and will be modified upon opening and saving a workbook.[54] In 2015, Excel Mobile became available for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile on Windows Store.[56][57]Excel for the webFurther information: Microsoft Office § Office on the webExcel for the web is a free lightweight version of Microsoft Excel available as part of Office on the web, which also includes web versions of Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint.Excel for the web can display most of the features available in the desktop versions of Excel, although it may not be able to insert or edit them. Certain data connections are not accessible on Excel for the web, including with charts that may use these external connections. Excel for the web also cannot display legacy features, such as Excel 4.0 macros or Excel 5.0 dialog sheets. There are also small differences between how some of the Excel functions work.[58]Microsoft Excel ViewerMicrosoft Excel Viewer was a freeware program for Microsoft Windows for viewing and printing spreadsheet documents created by Excel.[59] Microsoft retired the viewer in April 2018 with the last security update released in February 2019 for Excel Viewer 2007 (SP3).The first version released by Microsoft was Excel 97 Viewer.[62][63] Excel 97 Viewer was supported in Windows CE for Handheld PCs.[64] In October 2004, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2003.[65] In September 2007, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2003 Service Pack 3 (SP3).[66] In January 2008, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2007 (featuring a non-collapsible Ribbon interface).[67] In April 2009, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2007 Service Pack 2 (SP2).[68] In October 2011, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2007 Service Pack 3 (SP3).Microsoft advises to view and print Excel files for free to use the Excel Mobile application for Windows 10 and for Windows 7 and Windows 8 to upload the file to OneDrive and use Excel for the web with a Microsoft account to open them in a browser.ImpactExcel offers many user interface tweaks over the earliest electronic spreadsheets; however, the essence remains the same as in the original spreadsheet software, VisiCalc: the program displays cells organized in rows and columns, and each cell may contain data or a formula, with relative or absolute references to other cells.Excel 2.0 for Windows, which was modeled after its Mac GUI-based counterpart, indirectly expanded the installed base of the then-nascent Windows environment. Excel 2.0 was released a month before Windows 2.0, and the installed base of Windows was so low at that point in 1987 that Microsoft had to bundle a runtime version of Windows 1.0 with Excel 2.0.[120] Unlike Microsoft Word, there never was a DOS version of Excel.Excel became the first spreadsheet to allow the user to define the appearance of spreadsheets (fonts, character attributes, and cell appearance). It also introduced intelligent cell re-computation, where only cells dependent on the cell being modified are updated (previous spreadsheet programs recomputed everything all the time or waited for a specific user command). Excel introduced auto-fill, the ability to drag and expand the selection box to automatically copy a cell or row contents to adjacent cells or rows, adjusting the copies intelligently by automatically incrementing cell references or contents. Excel also introduced extensive graphing capabilities.",Microsoft Excel
finance,"Microsoft Excel, spreadsheet application launched in 1985 by the Microsoft Corporation. Excel is a popular spreadsheet system, which organizes data in columns and rows that can be manipulated through formulas that allow the software to perform mathematical functions on the data.
Lotus 1-2-3, first sold by the Lotus Development Corporation in 1982, dominated the mid-1980s spreadsheet market for personal computers (PCs) that ran MS-DOS, an operating system sold by Microsoft. Microsoft developed a competing spreadsheet, and the first version of Excel was released in 1985 for Apple Inc.’s Macintosh computer. Featuring strong graphics and fast processing, the new application quickly became popular. Lotus 1-2-3 was not available for the Macintosh, which allowed Excel to gain a following among Macintosh users. The next version of Excel, and the first version to run on Microsoft’s new Windows operating system, followed in 1987. With a graphics-heavy interface designed to run on the latest Windows computers, the powerful program became popular. Lotus was slow to release a Windows version of its spreadsheet, allowing Excel to increase its market share and eventually become the dominant spreadsheet application in the mid-1990s. Later versions of Excel featured significant upgrades such as tool bars, outlining, drawing, 3-D charts, numerous shortcuts, and more automated features. In 1995 Microsoft changed Excel’s naming system to emphasize the primary year of the product’s release. Excel 95 was designed for the latest 32-bit computers that used the Intel Corporation’s 386 microprocessor. New editions appeared in 1997 (Excel 97) and 1999 (Excel 2000). In 2003, Excel 2002 was released as part of the Office XP suite and included a significant new feature that allowed users to recover Excel data in the event of a computer crash.

Excel 2007 featured a redesigned user interface, sharing features with the Microsoft products Word and PowerPoint and allowing users to move smoothly between these applications. In addition, chart making, data sharing, security, formula writing, sorting, and filtering were improved.Spreadsheet, computer program that represents information in a two-dimensional grid of data, along with formulas that relate the data. Historically, a spreadsheet is an accounting ledger page that shows various quantitative information useful for managing a business. Electronic spreadsheets replaced pen-and-ink versions in the late 20th century. Spreadsheets are not limited to financial data, however, and are frequently used to represent scientific data and to carry out computations.
The first spreadsheet program was VisiCalc, written for the Apple II computer in 1979. For many users, this application most vividly showed the utility of personal computers for small businesses—in some cases turning a 20-hour-per-week bookkeeping chore into a few minutes of data entry. For example, a simple spreadsheet might hold payroll information with columns for employees’ names and addresses, Social Security numbers, hourly pay, hours worked, tax deductions, and net pay. Cells in the last column could have a formula attached to them to compute pay as a function of cells in the three preceding columns for each employee. The spreadsheet would show the net pay and, upon request, its formula. If tax-withholding rates were changed, all the net pay cells could be easily recomputed.Spreadsheets are also invaluable in what-if computations. Once a set of formulas have generated data in spreadsheet cells as functions of other cells, one can experiment by changing one parameter, such as a part’s price, to observe its effect on a product’s cost. With appropriate forecasting formulas, the market for the product, and hence the total profit at the old and new price, can then be projected. Used this way, spreadsheets serve the needs of managers, economists, and anyone who works with relationships between types of quantitative information.
Since spreadsheets can be programmed, they can also be used for general computations. They are used for modeling in science and engineering, and they are well suited to educational uses—for example, to display the synthesis of sound from simple audio waveforms. Furthermore, since they are two-dimensional grids of cells, they can be readily programmed as cellular automata, systems of cells whose state depends on the states of their neighbours. American mathematician John H. Conway’s “Game of Life” is a simple example, and other cellular automata can model complex physical or biological processes.
Today spreadsheets for personal computers generally include the ability to convert data into various types of graphs (such as pie charts and bar graphs) and are often integrated with other software, such as word processors and database programs.",Microsoft Excel
finance,"Advantages and Disadvantages of MS ExcelAdvantages and Disadvantages of MS ExcelThe widely used spreadsheet program Microsoft Excel divides all types of data into columns and rows and enables formula-based data entry and setting. Let's get additional knowledge about MS Excel before trying to comprehend what it is.
Data may be entered into the MS Excel spreadsheet application as a table. Data analysis in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets is simple. Microsoft Corporation introduced the spreadsheet program Microsoft Excel in 1985.
Advantages and Disadvantages of MS Excel
Even after almost 30 years, MS Excel continues to be the finest in the world. However, in the following paragraphs, we will explain what MS Excel is, how to capture data using it easily, and how easier platforms and programs than MS Excel have succeeded in the modern period.
History
The initial version of Microsoft Excel, known as Multiplan, debuted in 1982. It was a highly popular CP/M (control program for microcomputers), but it quickly lost popularity to other software and programs.Then, in 1987, Microsoft released Excel v2.0 for Windows, and by 1988, Lotus 1-2-3 and the burgeoning Quattro Pro were also being released. VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), often known as macros, was incorporated in Excel v5.0 for Windows when it was first launched by Microsoft in 1993.
Additionally, it created almost endless opportunities for the automation of monotonous activities such as data processing, process automation, and data presentation to enterprises.
How to start MS Excel?
You must also see how MS Excel begins if you want to understand what it is. If you carefully read the methods below, you can access MS Excel on your computer with no trouble at all:In Windows, first click on Start.
Next, choose All Programs.
Your following action will be to select MS Office.
After that, MS Office selected the MS-Excel option.
Suppose you prefer not to go such a long route. In that case, you may start by clicking the Start button, typing ""Microsoft Excel"" into the available search box, and then selecting ""Microsoft Excel"" to begin.
How does MS Excel function? What is it?
In Microsoft Excel, a file is known as a workbook. There is usually at least one worksheet in a workbook. Worksheet refers to a grid into which you may enter data and do calculations. A workbook may include several worksheets, each of which will have a unique name.
Worksheets are organized into rows and columns. A cell is defined as any column and row coming together. You can enter any information in a cell. Large amounts of text, a date, a number, or a formula can all be entered in a cell. Each cell's data entry options include a variety of borders, backgrounds, and font colors, sizes, and kinds.Some features of MS Excel
MS Excel is not a small program, so it has numerous features; below, we will tell you what else is on this spreadsheet apart from various editing and formatting.
I. Home
You have choices for font size, font style, font colour, background colour, alignment, formatting options, cell insertion and deletion, and editing options under this feature.
II. Insert
You may add equations, symbols, graphs, charts, and sparklines, as well as images and figures, tables, headers, and footers, using this tool, which also offers choices for table type and style.
III. Formulas

MS Excel is known and used all over the world for organising data and doing financial analysis. It is used in all business functions and in small to large companies.
The main uses of Excel are:
data entry
data management
Accounting
financial analysis
financial modelling
graphing and charting
Programming
Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
time management
task management
Advantages of MS Excel
Because it is simple to preserve data and add and remove information both easily and quickly, MS Excel is used for a variety of functions.Using MS Excel has several significant benefits, including:
Easy data input: MS Excel is frequently used for data entry or analysis since there is no limit to the quantity of information that can be saved in a spreadsheet, making it simple to enter as much data as you wish. Is. In Excel, filtering data is simple and highly useful.
Data retrieval is easier: Finding information printed on paper may take longer; however, this is not the case with an Excel spreadsheet. Data can be located and retrieved with ease.
Mathematical formulae that are Simple to Use: MS Excel's formula feature has made calculations simpler and faster.
More reliable: These spreadsheets, which may be password-protected on a laptop or desktop computer, are significantly less likely to be lost than records or pieces of paper with data that have been written down.
One location for all data: When the paperwork was completed in the past, data was housed in separate files and registers. Now that several worksheets may be added to a single MS Excel file, it has become more practical.Disadvantages of MS Excel
Data And Growth: One of the primary issues with MS Excel is that it cannot manage more than a few thousand rows without grinding to a halt. It also imposes file size restrictions. However, there are workarounds, just as there are for every app or software tool issue. If you find yourself in one of these circumstances, don't give up; instead, look at the tools available in Excel and apply them imaginatively to get the desired impact.
Difficult To Learn: Another Limitation of MS Excel is that it can be difficult to learn. This is because there are many different elements, such as formulas, functions, and keyboard shortcuts. However, this disadvantage may be alleviated with Excel tutorials for beginners or using templates to start quickly with a good learning method and regular practice.
Difficult formulas: One downside of using MS Excel is that there are multiple levels of complexity. For instance, some people could feel more at ease with the thought of doing short work, such as making an inventory list for clients so they can restock their stores, while others might not be familiar with formulae and charts, which could take up significant time. To prevent mistakes, you must be well-versed in grammar and formula usage.
No quick autofill features: The lack of rapid autofill features in this program is a further issue. For someone with rudimentary knowledge, not understanding how formulae function might be another difficult experience. As a result, you would have to learn the interface from scratch; yet these drawbacks can also present a chance for ongoing personal growth and development in addition to merely mastering the MS EXCEL skill set
Errors in Calculation: The most significant of MS Excel's drawbacks is that there are inaccuracies in computations. When working with fractions or percentages, for example, the decimal point may be lost, resulting in an error on the screen. This might make it tough for someone who doesn't know what they're doing to solve the problem without the aid of a professional. You'll also need to understand how to use the date and currency forms correctly.Conclusion
The effectiveness of Microsoft Excel is determined by the type of work you want to do with it. In a nutshell, what level do you want to utilize it at? MS Excel is a good choice if you only need it for its basic functions. However, if you are an accountant, you may need to search for a substitute. It would help if you determined the remainder by knowing the advantages and disadvantages of Microsoft Excel for business and learning.",Microsoft Excel
finance,"Production planning in Excel - advantages and disadvantages
Spreadsheets have been used for decades to solve many business management tasks. Due to their wide availability, they are used in many manufacturing enterprises, in particular in production planning departments. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using spreadsheets for production planning? What are the alternatives?
Production planning in spreadsheets - advantages
Excel and other spreadsheets have been used for production planning for over 40 years. There are many low-cost or free Excel templates available on the internet, such as a production planning template that includes a master production schedule (MPS), inventory management, or project management sheets. You can also find step-by-step instructions online on how to create such templates yourself. What other features of spreadsheets make them so popular in production planning departments?
Accessibility
The most important reason why companies turn to spreadsheets so often is their accessibility. Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets are relatively low cost for companies. There are also completely free spreadsheets available online as part of applications such as OpenOffice or LibreOffice.
Quick learning curve
Another aspect of the popularity of spreadsheets is the ease with which most people can get started with them. The vast majority of production planners already have some experience with spreadsheets. As a result, new hires can get up to speed faster and there is less time and money spent on training.
Support materials are widely available
Because spreadsheets are one of the most widely used programs in the world, there is a huge amount of support material available online. From user guides provided by developers to entire forums and groups dedicated to the topic.
Collaboration with other systems
Data from Excel or Google Sheets integrates well with other systems, such as accounting software or e-commerce platforms. This makes it much easier to transfer data from one system to another. Thus, users can transfer information from a spreadsheet (usually by creating a CSV file) or take information from third-party software and transfer it to a spreadsheet. This allows users, for example, to create customized reports or charts that are not available in other software.
Working in the cloud
In the past, one of the disadvantages of spreadsheets was that changes made to the spreadsheets were not automatically made available to all users. After making changes, the spreadsheet had to be emailed to the next user so they could see the changes and add their own. Today, solutions such as Google Sheets or Microsoft 365 offer access to spreadsheets in the cloud, making them available to multiple users at the same time.
Good for micro businesses
Although spreadsheets are no longer the only option available for business management, they still work well in a microbusiness environment, i.e., companies with 1 to 10 employees. Workflows in such companies are usually much less intensive and complex.
Planning in spreadsheets - disadvantages
Despite its advantages, production planning using spreadsheets has certain disadvantages and inconveniences. The most important ones include
Risk of human error
Manual data entry, which often occurs when using spreadsheets, is prone to human error. Studies conducted in academic centers have shown that the risk of error is closely related to the size of the spreadsheet (number of rows). When a large amount of data is entered into the system, which often happens in production planning, errors (even minor ones) can lead to serious consequences in production.
Data entry is time-consuming
In the case of spreadsheets, the need to enter large amounts of data is time-consuming. If you translate this into man-hours, then spreadsheets lose one of the most important arguments in favor of their use - low price.
Low scalability
As the complexity and volume of data increases, spreadsheets become less intuitive and ergonomic. The low level of user experience leads to a growing reluctance of staff to work with the application. Spreadsheets also do not provide the level of process automation that is needed to manage large production structures.
Advanced features require extensive training
The basics of working with spreadsheets can be learned in a few days. However, mastering the most advanced features, such as VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) programming, requires tens or hundreds of hours of training.
Offline version makes collaboration difficult
If a company is still using spreadsheets in the traditional way, i.e., storing files on a computer and exchanging them via email, it is difficult to create an effective workflow. One in which information is instantly available to all participants. Since production planning is a collaborative process that often requires more people to be involved and have access to information, this can be a serious obstacle.
An alternative to spreadsheets
The disadvantages associated with the use of spreadsheets in production planning have given rise to the development of software designed for this purpose. We are talking about computerized systems of the APS (Advanced Planning and Scheduling) class. They allow you to create highly optimized production plans in a very short time. The QGUAR APS PRO system allows you to plan operations for several products and jobs simultaneously. The created schedule is visualized using an interactive Gantt chart. An authorized user can adjust it by drag and drop if necessary.
Unlike spreadsheets, well-built APS systems are also intuitive and easy to navigate. They automate a huge portion of data entry tasks, reducing the risk of human error. APS systems are now available on a subscription basis. By spreading payments over time, there is no need for large one-time costs with an amortization period of several years.",Microsoft Excel

Techopedia Explains Microsoft Excel
MS Excel is a commercial spreadsheet application that is produced and distributed by Microsoft for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS operating systems. It features the ability to perform basic calculations, use graphing tools, create pivot tables and create macros, among other useful features.
Spreadsheet applications such as MS Excel use a collection of cells arranged into rows and columns to organize and manipulate data. They can also display data as charts, histograms and line graphs.
MS Excel permits users to arrange data in order to view various factors from different perspectives. Microsoft Visual Basic is a programming language used for applications in Excel, allowing users to create a variety of complex numerical methods. Programmers are given an option to code directly using the Visual Basic Editor, including Windows for writing code, debugging and code module organization.
History and Future of MS Excel
In the early days of accessible PC business computing, Microsoft Excel played a central role in bookkeeping and record-keeping for enterprise operations.
One of the best examples of a use case for MS Excel is a table with an autosum format.
It's very easy in Microsoft Excel to simply enter a column of values and click into a cell at the bottom of the spreadsheet, and then click the “autosum” button to allow that cell to add up all of the numbers entered above. This takes the place of the manual ledger counts that had been a labor-intensive part of business previous to the evolution of the modern spreadsheet.
The autosum and other innovations have made MS Excel a must-have for various kinds of enterprise computing, including looking at daily, weekly or monthly numbers, tabulating payroll and taxes, and other kinds of similar business processes.
Various types of simple use cases made Microsoft Excel a key end-user technology as well, useful in training and professional development. For a number of years, MS Excel has been included in basic business diploma courses on business computing, and temporary work agencies may assess individuals on their skills with Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel for a wide range of clerical duties.
However, as the world of business technology has advanced, Microsoft Excel has become largely obsolete in some ways.
The reason for this is a concept called “visual dashboard” technology or “data visualization.”
Generally, companies and vendors have come up with neat new ways to present data visually that do not involve end users looking at a traditional spreadsheet with columns of numbers and identifiers. Instead, they look at graphs and charts and other sophisticated presentations, to understand the numbers better and more quickly. People have realized that the visual presentation is far easier to “read.”
The principle of data visualization has shifted the use cases for Microsoft Excel. Where businesses may have used Microsoft Excel in the past for, say, hundreds of records, most of today's business use cases involve spreadsheets that handle less than a few dozen values for any particular project.
The idea is that if the spreadsheet is longer than a couple of dozen rows, it will be more effective to display the information on a visual dashboard than in a traditional spreadsheet format.

This chapter provides an overview of the Excel application along with an orientation for accessing the commands and features of an Excel workbook.
MAKING DECISIONS WITH EXCEL
Taking a very simple view, Excel is a tool that allows you to enter quantitative data into an electronic spreadsheet to apply one or many mathematical computations. These computations ultimately convert that quantitative data into information. The information produced in Excel can be used to make decisions in both professional and personal contexts. For example, employees can use Excel to determine how much inventory to buy for a clothing retailer, how much medication to administer to a patient, or how much money to spend to stay within a budget. With respect to personal decisions, you can use Excel to determine how much money you can spend on a house, how much you can spend on car lease payments, or how much you need to save to reach your retirement goals. We will demonstrate how you can use Excel to make these decisions and many more throughout this text.

Excel will assign a file name to the workbook, such as Book1, Book2, Book3, and so on, depending on how many new workbooks are opened. Figure 1.2 shows a blank workbook after starting Excel. Take some time to familiarize yourself with this screen. Your screen may be slightly different based on the version you’re using.
Quick access toolbar with commands Excel Help, Zoom slider, view options, and workbook tabs.
Figure 1.2 Blank Workbook
Your workbook should already be maximized (or shown at full size) once Excel is started, as shown in Figure 1.2. If necessary locate the Maximize button as shown in Figure 1.3.

NAVIGATING WORKSHEETS
Data are entered and managed in an Excel worksheet. The worksheet contains several rectangles called cells for entering numeric and nonnumeric data. Each cell in an Excel worksheet contains an address, which is defined by a column letter followed by a row number. For example, the cell that is currently activated in Figure 1.3 is A1. This would be referred to as cell location A1 or cell reference A1. The following steps explain how you can navigate in an Excel worksheet:
Place your mouse pointer over cell D5 and left click.
Check to make sure column letter D and row number 5 are highlighted, as shown in Figure 1.4.
Note: Your highlighted column letter and row number may be different than figure shown.
Bold outline D5 cell activated.
Figure 1.4 Activating a Cell Location
Move the mouse pointer to cell A1.
Click and hold the left mouse button and drag the mouse pointer back to cell D5.
Release the left mouse button. You should see several cells highlighted, as shown in Figure 1.5.
This is referred to as a cell range and is documented as follows: A1:D5. Any two cell locations separated by a colon are known as a cell range. The first cell is the top left corner of the range, and the second cell is the lower right corner of the range.
Cell range A1:D5 is highlighted. Multiple worksheet tabs featured at bottom. Shift F11 adds new worksheet to workbook.
Figure 1.5 Highlighting a Range of Cells
At the bottom of the screen, you’ll see worksheets. Depending on your version of Excel, you will see either three as displayed above or just one. If you only have one sheet, click the “Insert Worksheet” to add a worksheet. Depending on your version, you instead may have a + sign; a click on the + adds an additional worksheet as well. This is how you open or add a worksheet within a workbook. Add another worksheet so that you now have three sheets displaying here.
Click the Sheet1 worksheet tab at the bottom of the worksheet to return to the worksheet shown in Figure 1.5.

THE EXCEL RIBBON
Excel’s features and commands are found in the Ribbon, which is the upper area of the Excel screen that contains several tabs running across the top. Each tab provides access to a different set of Excel commands. Figure 1.6 shows the commands available in the Home tab of the Ribbon. Table 1.1 “Command Overview for Each Tab of the Ribbon” provides an overview of the commands that are found in each tab of the Ribbon.

Table 1.1 Command Overview for Each Tab of the Ribbon
Tab Name	Description of Commands
File	Also known as the Backstage view of the Excel workbook. Contains all commands for opening, closing, saving, and creating new Excel workbooks. Includes print commands, document properties, e-mailing options, and help features. The default settings and options are also found in this tab.
Home	Contains the most frequently used Excel commands. Formatting commands are found in this tab along with commands for cutting, copying, pasting, and for inserting and deleting rows and columns.

The Ribbon shown in Figure 1.6 is full, or maximized. The benefit of having a full Ribbon is that the commands are always visible while you are developing a worksheet. However, depending on the screen dimensions of your computer, you may find that the Ribbon takes up too much vertical space on your worksheet. If this is the case, you can minimize the Ribbon by clicking the button shown in Figure 1.6. When minimized, the Ribbon will show only the tabs and not the command buttons. When you click on a tab, the command buttons will appear until you select a command or click anywhere on your worksheet.

By placing these commands in the Quick Access Toolbar, you do not have to navigate through the Ribbon to find them. To customize the Quick Access Toolbar, click the down arrow as shown in Figure 1.7. This will open a menu of commands that you can add to the Quick Access Toolbar. If you do not see the command you are looking for on the list, select the More Commands option.

Morningstar Ratings 101: What You Need to Know A breakdown of Morningstar’s ratings What is the star rating? The Morningstar Rating for funds, often called the star rating, is a purely quantitative, backward-looking measure of a fund’s past performance, measured from one to five stars. Star ratings are calculated at the end of every month. You can search for a fund to see its most recent star rating for free on Morningstar.com. How does the star rating work? The Morningstar Rating methodology rates funds within the same Morningstar Category based on an enhanced Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure. To receive a Morningstar Rating, a fund must have a record of more than three years. How is the star rating used? The Morningstar Rating helps investors assess a fund’s track record relative to its peers. It’s intended for use as the first step in the fund evaluation process. You can read more about the rating’s performance on Morningstar.com. What measures does Morningstar take to protect investors from misuses of the star ratings in advertising? We make the most recent ratings available for free to everyone at Morningstar.com, so they can validate any promotions themselves. The most recent ratings are also available on other media websites, brokerage and asset manager websites, and within 401(k) plans. We make the most recent ratings available to advisors through Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Office, and Morningstar Advisor Workstation and through data feeds. We review advertising material sent to us to assist firms with the approval process required by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, though not everything is sent to us. And if we encounter an incorrect use—whether it was sent to us or not—we notify the firm and ask them to correct it. If the firm does not correct it, we have the right to terminate the license to use our ratings, per our licensing agreement. We are not aware of an example where a firm’s compliance department did not accept our guidance. What’s the Morningstar Medalist Rating? The Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar’s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Analyst Ratings are continuously monitored and reevaluated at least every 14 months. How does the Morningstar Medalist Rating work? Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar’s conviction in those products’ investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they’re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst’s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about the Medalist Ratings, including their methodology, please go to http://global.morningstar.com/managerdisclosures. What is the Morningstar Sustainability Rating for funds? The Morningstar Sustainability Rating is a measure of how well the holdings in a portfolio are managing their environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks and opportunities relative to their Morningstar Category peers. The Sustainability Rating is depicted by globe icons where High equals 5 globes and Low equals 1 globe. Sustainability Ratings are updated monthly.

However, be aware that Bloomberg is an expensive system and that having your own terminal may not be practical for all users. Should you decide to subscribe to your own service, Bloomberg can help you install the software over the phone, or can come out to visit you and assist in installation.
2
Note: the software can be installed on most PCs or Macs, but the company will give you a special keyboard for navigating the system.
The second method of accessing Bloomberg is to find a public facility that has a Bloomberg terminal. Many larger libraries and universities have one, so that is a good place to start looking.
3
The downside of this approach is that you won't be able to customize the system and will have to share it with other users. However, for many users these drawbacks may be outweighed by the cost savings over subscribing to the system as an individual.
Once you have accessed the system, the next trick is to figure out how to navigate. A good starting place would be either to schedule a visit from a Bloomberg customer service representative or to call customer service for some help. Bloomberg is usually quite good at providing technical support and assistance, and a representative should be able to give you a good start on using the terminal.

The screenshot above shows the Bloomberg log-in page. Each user has a user name and password that will allow them to access the system, although at public facilities you might share this with other users. Once you have logged in, you're ready to begin using the Bloomberg system.
Basic Navigation
The Bloomberg terminal, from the perspective of the end-user, is a Windows-based application, making it compatible with the popular Excel program, a very important aspect of the system for those in the finance industry. Bloomberg also offers users access to the application online and through mobile devices, via its Bloomberg Anywhere service.
4
For portfolio managers and brokers, having the ability to access real-time market information from almost anywhere in the world, is an incredibly convenient and important advantage of a Bloomberg subscription.
The first thing most people notice when they sit down in front of a Bloomberg terminal, is the keyboard. Although it is similar to a standard desktop keyboard, Bloomberg terminals substitute the function keys on a standard keyboard (i.e., F4) with market sector keys. Additionally, Bloomberg keyboards incorporate color coding to make use more intuitive. The function keys along the top of the keyboard are mostly color coded yellow and allow a user to navigate by asset class: government bonds, corporate bonds, municipals, commodities, equity, currency, and more.
5
For instance, if a user is interested in examining a stock, they will generally access it through the key. If they want to look at trading the US$ versus the Euro, most functions would be accessed with the key. There are also special function keys for preferred stocks and funds. The Bloomberg keyboard also has a special key for communicating with other users via email or instant message as well as a key that can be used when you require assistance.

Bloomberg Tickers
Bloomberg uses abbreviations and tickers for most of its functions. For example, someone looking for a quote on Microsoft stock would type in the symbol for Microsoft (MSFT) followed by the key and then hit enter. This would bring up a menu of options relating to Microsoft stock. Since very few users know more than a small fraction of the almost limitless number of available Bloomberg options, these menus present an excellent way to see what sort of analytics are available for a given security or market.
Once you are familiar with Bloomberg, you might begin to memorize some of the shortcuts, thereby saving a step for familiar functions (as opposed to going through the menu.) For instance, if you want to see the basic description page for Microsoft's stock, instead of accessing it through the menu, you could instead type and then hit enter. The ""des"" is the abbreviation for description pages on Bloomberg, and this common function will provide a good general overview of most securities.
8
Note: Because there are an almost unlimited number of functions in Bloomberg, the best way to begin navigating the system is probably to use menus and then select your favorite functions from there. Over time, you can begin to memorize the shortcuts for your most commonly used functions, while continuing to use the menus for less frequent choices.
Help
You will notice that there is a green key on the Bloomberg keyboard. This key can be your best friend, especially when you are new to the system. By hitting the help key once, you can get information about the screen that you are currently viewing. Hitting help twice will send an instant message to the Bloomberg help desk. You can then ask your question via live chat with a Bloomberg specialist who can guide you on using the terminal as well as on whatever particular function you are trying to access.
9
Messaging
One of the nice features of Bloomberg is that it has a fairly robust messaging system. This system allows users to stay in contact with other users and is one of the reasons that Bloomberg is so ubiquitous in the financial industry. You can look up other users of the system in order to send them a message, and if you contact someone regularly, you can set them up on speed-dial as well. When messaging, you have two choices.
The first is to send a traditional message, which is basically like an email. The second is to open up an instant message window with the other user, which, as the name implies, is similar to traditional instant messaging. Both methods work great, so which one you chose is largely a matter of personal preference.
10
News and Market Monitors
In addition to analyzing individual securities, a common use of the Bloomberg terminal is to monitor news updates and financial market movements. Here too, there is an endless array of possibilities, and which one users prefer is often a matter of personal choice. However, there are a couple of common screens that can serve as a starting point for new users. Note: When in doubt, the menu functions can also help here. The general menu that you see for most asset classes (including equities, currencies, commodities, etc.) will usually contain listings for market monitors that provide a good starting place for analysis.
News
The best place to begin looking for news on Bloomberg is by typing or and then hitting . These function bring up a page of the top news stories of the day, which are updated on an ongoing basis. Selecting any of these headlines will bring up the full story. Within the function, there are additional sub-menus that will allow you to view news stories that are filtered by asset class, geographic region, or topic.
11
For instance, you can choose to see the top worldwide stories, the top U.S. stories, or the top stories for stocks, for bonds, or for almost any other category you choose. You can also (if you are using your own personal Bloomberg) choose to set the default for top news to whichever category you prefer, so that when you type in you see the news category that is most important to you. The screenshot below shows an example of the screen for top worldwide news headlines.
News
News.
As mentioned above, news can also be customized in a wide variety of ways. For instance, if you are primarily interested in the stock market, you can access top news for stocks. The screenshot below displays this. As you can see, the stock news screen is further broken down into sections: first for worldwide headlines, then by continent with North America, followed by Europe and finally Asia. Users seeking even greater detail can click on the regions in white to access stock news headlines specific to a region or country, such as the United States, Canada, Eastern Europe, etc.

News by Geography.
Market Monitor
There are a number of market monitor pages that cover a variety of asset classes, as well as some that cover a single asset class or market sector. The monitor below is accessed by typing into your Bloomberg. The PX1 screen is a little bit more focused on the U.S. Treasury bond market, while also giving updates on the Dow, Nasdaq, S&P, as well as the gold and oil markets.
Market Monitor
Market Monitor.
The screenshot below is another example of a market monitor that is primarily focused on the bond market. This screen can be viewed by typing.
12
Although this is another bond market screen, you will notice that it covers a broader array of securities than the PX1 function discussed above. In addition to U.S. Treasuries, the BTMM screen shows markets for a wide variety of money market instruments, as well as mortgage-backed bonds and currencies. The BTMM screen also includes quotes on the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P, as well as oil.
13
Finally, the screen contains a listing of the day's major economic releases, making it easy to keep track of this as well. In addition to PX1 and BTMM, there are a multitude of additional market monitor screens that primarily focus on movements in the bond markets. As you can imagine, there is no one screen that is ""best,"" and which one users prefer is ultimately a matter of personal choice. Market Monitor
Market Monitor.
In addition to monitors that primarily track bond markets, there are also a wide variety of monitors that focus on equity markets. As a good starting place, you can pull up the monitor below by typing into your keyboard.
14
As you can see, this monitor displays equity index movements from around the globe. You can get more detail on additional markets in a given region by drilling down into the menu. For instance, by clicking on the ""Asia/Pacific"" heading, you can access updates on the markets in that region that were unable to fit on the front page due to space constraints.
Note: On most of these monitor pages, as well as many other screens, any of the headers in a white font with a number in front of it indicate an additional sub-menu that can be accessed. For instance, on the screen below there is a ""1) Americas"", a ""2) EMEA"" and a ""3) Asia/Pacific"" that can all be accessed either by clicking on them or by typing in the appropriate number and hitting . There are also choices at the top marked by ""95) Settings"" and ""96) News"" that represent sub-menus as well.
15

Economics
In addition to monitoring market indices and news headlines, the Bloomberg terminal can also be used to monitor economic forecasts and releases. By typing you can access the main economics page.
16
This page gives a listing of all upcoming economic data releases, as well as consensus forecasts of what economists at major banks and brokerages are predicting those numbers will be. Upon release, the ECO screen also shows the actual number, as well as any revision to the previous month's report. For those interested in overseas markets, there is an ECO page for most major economies.
17
By using the dropdown menus for ""Region"" and ""Country"" you can access economic forecasts and data from Europe, China, and elsewhere, in addition to the United States. The screenshot below displays a basic ECO screen with data for the United States.

Analyzing Securities and Currencies
In addition to monitoring news and markets, Bloomberg can also be used to analyze individual securities. In fact, the analytics available in Bloomberg are quite robust, and they cover a number of major asset classes including equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities, mutual funds and ETFs. This guide will attempt to cover some of the basic functions that are available. To , contact a Bloomberg representative for training, read Investopedia's Advanced Bloomberg Guide, or explore additional functions in a hands-on manner.
If you are uncertain what the ticker symbol is for a security you want to look at, you can find the ticker by hitting the key for the asset class you are looking at followed by.
18
For example, if you wanted to analyze Microsoft stock but didn't know the ticker, you could hit and then type in Microsoft and the ticker would appear. Note: using this function will pull up a list of all the tickers for that company. For instance, if a stock is listed on multiple exchanges, all of them will appear. Therefore, it is important to make sure you select the correct security from the list when using this function (for instance, in this example most users would be seeking the ticker for Microsoft stock listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange).
Once you have the correct ticker, the basic screen for beginning security analysis is the description page, Bloomberg abbreviation.
8
The screenshot below shows page one of the Bloomberg description for Microsoft stock (similar screens are also available for many types of bonds and other asset classes). As you can see, the description page provides a brief overview of what the company does, as well as basic information such as a price quote, 52-week high and low, market capitalization, earnings per share, P/E Ratio, dividend yield, and more. The page below is only the first page of ten pages of security description information.
By scrolling forward, you can access additional information, including contact details for the company, and a breakdown of the company's revenue and earnings by geographic region and market segment. You can also find detailed financial data such as an income statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet.
19
(Note: the financial data can sometimes be a bit dated, so you might want to double check the date listed next to the financial statements if seeing the most recent data is important to you.) Analysis
Analysis.
In addition to looking at descriptive information or financial fundamentals, Bloomberg can also be used to analyze a security's price history and trading patterns. By typing into the system, users can access a price history for whatever security they are looking at, while typing will bring up a simple graph of that price history.
20
For users interested in more advanced technical analysis, Bloomberg offers an advanced suite of charting capabilities. While a complete description of available charts is beyond the scope of this article, some of the tools available include relative strength indicators (RSI), Bollinger Bands®, intraday price and volume charts, candlestick charts, and comparison charts displaying multiple securities.
21
An example of a simple price and volume chart for Microsoft stock is displayed below.
Analysis
Analysis.
Bloomberg also provides easy access to company updates. For instance, in addition to the top news stories discussed, Bloomberg also offers company-specific news. For example, once you have pulled up a security (such as Microsoft stock) you can type into the Bloomberg and a scrolling list of the most recent news stories concerning that security will come up. You can then click on any of those headlines in order to read the full story. Additional security specific information that can be found on Bloomberg includes earnings estimates (Bloomberg ticker EE), analyst recommendations (Bloomberg ticker ANR), and credit ratings (Bloomberg ticker CRPR).
22
23
More on analyzing specific asset classes is below.
Equities
When searching for publicly traded equity shares, Bloomberg allows users to search by name, exchange, country, and other such topics. Additionally, the equity menu allows users to view historical pricing on a stock (see image below), read a description of the business, view any outstanding corporate debt the company may have, and view analyst reports and estimates for the stock, along with dozens of other features. This menu also allows users to search for indexes such as the S&P 500 or Russell 2000.
24
Equities
Equities.
Bloomberg also allows clients to compare and contrast equities side by side, offering a comparative analysis of any two equities. Comparison fields include fundamental analysis, historical ratios, and technical charting. In addition to comparative functionality, Bloomberg also includes screeners, allowing clients to screen for stocks using a multitude of metrics.
25
After running a screen, users can also filter results and create custom equity sets, which allow for a quick reference of real-time results for a portfolio of equities (very handy for traders, brokers and other such financial professionals).
Fixed Income
Much like with equities, Bloomberg allows users to search for real-time data on fixed income securities. This includes corporate debt, municipal bonds, and government bonds.
26
Similar to the historical price screen for equities, we are able to view historical day-over-day changes in security values, along with implied yield-to-maturities, for any given day. Additionally, credit ratings and cost of capital information is available for fixed income securities.
27
Derivatives
One of Bloomberg's best features is its derivatives capabilities. Not only can clients find real-time values for securities, such as exchange traded options, and futures contracts, such as the active contract for WTI, but Bloomberg also allows users to value hard-to-price derivatives. For OTC options, for example, Bloomberg lets users customize their option valuation models, to come up with an estimated value.
28
A user can decide to value an OTC option on the S&P 500 using the continuous Black-Scholes model, using historical volatility (see image below), for example. Once priced, users can view the values of the Greeks associated with the option in question, to verify that their price estimate is in line with those expectations.
Derivatives
Derivatives.
SWAPS
SWAPS are a type of derivative used by large banks and institutional investors. The Bloomberg Terminal has a SWAP manager tool that is a highly customizable swap pricing utility. It allows users to input the parameters of a swap agreement and come up with an estimate for the value of that swap, at any given date in time. Additionally, clients can view underlying swap curves to determine that the underlying inputs match expected values. As the swap market continues to grow, the Swap Manager tool will no doubt gain more and more popularity with analysts.
29
Foreign Exchange
With the FX market being a 24-hour marketplace, Bloomberg is the ideal tool for FX participants. Users can view real-time rates for dozens of currencies, along with basis curves for most pairs, and rate information for a given currency. Additionally, with Bloomberg's ability to capture real-time news and economic updates, its FX capabilities are a very powerful tool for those trading in the foreign exchange market.
30
Tips and Tricks
Because Bloomberg has such a robust suite of analytics and market capabilities, getting the system to do what you want it to can be a challenge, at least until you become familiar with it. Fortunately, there are some tricks that can speed up your learning curve. Make use of the function: Bloomberg provides excellent customer support; make use of it by hitting the key when you need assistance. Remember, hitting once describes the function you are using; hitting it twice will connect you to customer support via instant message.
9
Schedule a visit from a Bloomberg representative: Particularly if you have your own system, you should take advantage of a visit from a Bloomberg representative who can walk you through the system and show you how to use some of the functions that might be helpful for what you intend to do.
Get Bloomberg ""cheat sheets"": Bloomberg puts out ""cheat sheets"" that list common functions and their Bloomberg tickers. These sheets are broken down by assets class, so if you intend to analyze equities, get a sheet with the most common equity functions, if you like fixed income, get a fixed income guide, etc. These ""cheat sheets"" should give you a good starting point for navigating common Bloomberg functions.
31
Visit Bloomberg University: By typing or into the system, you will be taken to a screen that offers a wide variety of training videos, informational papers and live seminars. The seminars are broken down by region, so you might be interested in attending one in your area (there is a fee for some of the seminars, but the majority are offered free to Bloomberg users). Incorporate Excel into Bloomberg: Bloomberg connects rather seamlessly with Excel, so you can use spreadsheets to analyze data downloaded from Bloomberg. Even better, you can build a spreadsheet that automatically updates your data each time you open it, saving you the trouble of doing so by hand. Best of all, Bloomberg offers sample spreadsheets for common types of analysis (i.e. tracking stock price movements or analyzing company balance sheets), thereby saving you the trouble of building your own spreadsheet. You can also further customize these generic spreadsheets that Bloomberg offers in order to fit your specific needs.

How Much Does the Bloomberg Terminal Cost?
For a standard license, a Bloomberg Terminal costs around $2,000 per month, or $24,000 per year.
Can You Place Trades from the Bloomberg Terminal?

I use the terminal for commodities and equities. The commodity portion has gotten steadily worse since 2018. Data disappears, much of the cash pricing is in accurate and a mess. I have taken to using a competing product for commodity data. It is fine for equities and IB, which I need. If you need commodity data, any of the competitors offer a much better product at a lower price.
Pros
The charting and graphing tools generally work well.
Cons
Data is often incorrect and should not be taken at face value. Data sets seem to disappear without warning, so relying on it vs the competition can be problematic. The product seems to be getting buggier every day. The news is at least for commodities is awful...slow, stale, and not at all cutting edge.Bloomberg Terminal is vital tool for fixed income managers

finance,"The Bloomberg Terminal is a computer software system provided by the financial data vendor Bloomberg L.P. that enables professionals in the financial service sector and other industries to access Bloomberg Professional Services through which users can monitor and analyze real-time financial market data and place trades on the electronic trading platform.[1] It was developed by employees working for businessman Michael Bloomberg. The system also provides news, price quotes, and messaging across its proprietary secure network. It is well known among the financial community for its black interface, which has become a recognizable trait of the service.[2] The first version of the terminal was released in December 1982.
Most large financial firms have subscriptions to Bloomberg Professional Services. Many exchanges charge their own additional fees for access to real time price feeds across the terminal. The same applies to various news organizations.
All Bloomberg Terminals are leased in two-year cycles (in the late 1990s and early 2000s, three-year contracts were an option), with leases originally based on how many displays were connected to each terminal (this predated the move to Windows-based application). Most Bloomberg setups have between two and six displays. As a data analytics and electronic trading platform, the Bloomberg terminal is available for an annual fee of around $24k per user or $27k per year for subscribers that use only one terminal.[3] As of 2022, there were 325,000 Bloomberg Terminal subscribers worldwide.[4]",Bloomberg Terminal

At its core, Morningstar provides data on over 620,000 investment offerings, including stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs. With over 5,000 employees across 27 countries, Morningstar has established itself as an authority in the investment world. Initially renowned for its impartial mutual fund research, Morningstar has expanded its influence and become essential for new and expert investors. Its prominent “Morningstar Premium” service furnishes individual investors with updated information on various investment opportunities ranging from equities to fixed-income securities. With over $215 billion in assets under management and $1.7 billion in revenue, Morningstar has become a dominant force in the investment management industry. For novice and seasoned investors, Morningstar is an essential resource for making well-informed investment decisions. Here is a Morningstar review weighing its pros and cons. Learn More About Morningstar The Pros of Using Morningstar’s Services Morningstar provides in-depth investment research and tools to help you make informed decisions. Here are some of the major pros of using their services: Depth of Information Morningstar offers a wealth of stock market data, stock analysis, research tools, and investor newsletters, enabling investors to develop a well-rounded understanding of potential investments. They provide details on stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, etc. You can compare investment picks and find ones that match your goals by evaluating a range of factors like growth, value, dividends, fundamentals, and risks. Independence and Trustworthiness Morningstar has built a reputation for providing reliable, independent investment research. Their technical analysis and ratings are designed to help investors make informed decisions without biases or hidden agendas. Many investors have come to trust Morningstar’s objectivity and credibility. User-Friendly Experience Users appreciate Morningstar’s clean, intuitive interface, making their website and tools user-friendly. Their partnership with Sharesight for portfolio performance tracking has also been well received. The site is easy to navigate, with investment data and analysis organized logically. For most investors, the abundance of information is presented in a digestible way. The Cons to Consider When Using Morningstar While Morningstar can be an invaluable tool for researching investments, it has some downsides to keep in mind. Cost For individual investors or those just getting started, Morningstar can be pricey. Their basic service starts at $249/year, and more robust offerings can cost $420/year or more. The fees may be worth it for professional investors managing large portfolios, but for smaller investors, the cost could outweigh the benefits. Focus on Growth Morningstar places a strong emphasis on an investment’s potential for growth and future returns. This forward-looking approach won’t appeal to all investors, especially those more focused on an investment’s historical track record and past performance. Their ratings and “star” system can favor growth stock picks with the potential for high future returns and overvalue individual stocks with a proven history of solid returns. Who is Morningstar Best For? Morningstar is ideal for certain types of investors but may not suit everyone. Let’s look at who Morningstar’s tools and resources are best suited for: Value Investors: If you’re a value investor who prefers buying and holding high-quality, fundamentally sound companies for the long run, Morningstar is for you.

They give you an easy way to evaluate your portfolio’s performance, risk, diversification, and more. Investors seeking low-cost, diversified funds: Morningstar’s star rating system makes it easy to identify well-managed funds with solid long-term performance and below-average fees. Final Verdict: Is Morningstar Worth It? So, is Morningstar worth the investment? For many investors, the answer is yes. Morningstar is an industry leader for good reason.

Morningstar is one of the biggest names in investment research and with good reason. Premium-level membership includes resources to guide your investment decisions, focusing on the best stocks and funds. Let’s dig in and find out in this Morningstar review what makes it so great. Pros Pros Extensive research covering mutual funds, stocks, ETFs and bonds Best investments lists help you pick the best stocks and funds Coverage for more than 620,000 investments Discounts available for multi-year subscriptions Cons Cons Paid membership required for premium content Annual cost is as much as $359 when you pay monthly What is Morningstar? Morningstar is the perfect service if you believe in fundamental/ value investing. If you are a “chartist” then Morningstar's service is not for you. The website will not discuss technical charts, which determine when you should buy or sell via indicators like the stock passing the 52-week average. Morningstar is more about proper asset allocation, low fee investment vehicles, and investments that generate consistent returns. It also offers several other key features: Investment thesis: Morningstar analyzes stocks, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). It gives pros and cons for any investment (they call it “Bulls and Bears”). Stock and mutual fund screener: Users can find investments via hundreds of key data points. Morningstar offers a comparative benchmark performance category. Subscribers have access to actionable analyst reports with over 2,000 funds, ETFs, and stocks. Mutual funds are allocated into specific investment categories and stocks. The platform also states the annual fees to own an ETF or mutual fund. This is an important aspect that is often missed. Typically, the lower the cost, the better the odds to meet or beat the comparative index. Morningstar's X-Ray tool is second to none and ensures you aren't over-allocated in a specific sector, country, or stock. The platform also offers free and premium screeners. This is a quick method to narrow your selection of a stock or mutual fund. The cost analyzer is also a great tool to help pick one ETF or mutual fund over another. Visit Morningstar Who is Morningstar for? Morningstar is best for value investors who want to understand the fundamentals behind every investment. Originally, the firm reviewed only mutual funds, but it added stocks to the review roster a few years ago. Today, Morningstar's rating system is known throughout the investment community. I look at services like Morningstar as a way to help speed up my research. You should always do your own investment research and not take what anyone says as gospel. Morningstar is better for fundamental analysis. That’s different from the technical analysis used by chart-reading active investors. How does Morningstar work? Morningstar is a subscription service but also offers some free information. It started out in 1985 by rating mutual funds but has since expanded its services. When you sign up as a premium member, you'll get access to all data and tools, including an analysis of 621,370 investment assets. Every asset gets its own detail page. You can navigate to many other features as well, including “best of” lists of the top stocks and funds picked by Morningstar’s professional analysts. Investment reports from Morningstar are highly respected and among the best in the industry. A separation between Morningstar and the businesses it covers encourages an independent, trustworthy result. Morningstar portfolios and tools Portfolio X-Ray tool While a mutual fund's prospectus will state its allocation in only U.S.-based companies, the statement may not be completely true. Morningstar's Portfolio X-Ray tool takes a mutual fund's quarterly SEC reporting of their individual stock ownership and uses it to determine your true asset allocation. This is important because you may have the correct asset allocation on a macro level, you could be heavily weighted in a particular stock or category unknown to you. This could unknowingly increase your investment risk and decrease returns. Although the X-Ray tool was great when we first reviewed Morningstar in 2010, X-Ray hasn't been improving. There are many other alternatives today. Competitors such as Empower offer free high-level analysis, which is decent enough for the average investor. While Morningstar's Portfolio X-Ray goes into great detail about your asset allocation, it's a manual process. Morningstar's X-Ray tool is still useful, but it needs improvement and ‘s more cumbersome than alternatives offered by companies such as The Motley Fool. You can try out the Instant X-Ray tool for free to get a taste of what the premium version includes. Further Reading: The Motley Fool vs. Morningstar comparison Stock screeners Again, you can use basic screeners for free, but the Premium Stock Screener is a much more powerful tool with additional features to zero in on potential investments. Morningstar has screeners for stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs to help you find investments that match your goals, risk tolerance, and have Morningstar ratings to support your decisions. One unique tool is the ESG Screener, which assists in finding investments that meet environment, sustainability, and governance guidelines, as well as specific minimum Morningstar ratings. Other platforms like Seeking Alpha and The Motley Fool also have stock screeners you can try. But Morningstar's emphasis on sustainability ratings might be a selling point for some investors. There's also pre-built screeners you can use if you need help finding your next investments. And remember: Morningstar has over 150 analysts, and their ratings and insights into companies is one of the main selling points of signing up. You get curated research straight from the source rather than having to rely on headlines or doing your own digging. Of course, analysts can be wrong and often are. However, Morningstar does a good job at taking complex topics and company profiles and simplifying them to help with your decision making. Portfolio monitor Premium Morningstar customers can also use its portfolio monitoring tool to receive updates about your portfolio's performance. You can also edit how often you receive updates. Just note that this doesn't include updates for stocks on your watchlist and is only for your actual portfolio. Mobile app Morningstar has a mobile app for Android, iPhone, and iPad devices. The app is free to download and can link up to your Morningstar account. These are regularly updated for security and new features. Options include the ability to sync portfolios from the website to your iPhone. The app is great if you want to quickly analyze a stock. Otherwise, you are better off visiting the website. Visit Morningstar Morningstar plans and prices Anyone can use Morningstar’s free version, which includes some useful data, but it’s far from the complete set of what you get with Morningstar Premium. Premium memberships give you tools to hone in on new investment ideas, evaluate current investments and monitor your portfolio. These are the price plans for Morningstar Premium: Price plan Cost Annual cost Monthly $29.95 $359.40 Annual $199 $199 Two-Year $349 $174.50 Three-Year $449 $149.67 There's also a 7-day free trial you can take advantage of if you want to test out Morningstar Premium before paying. Visit Morningstar How does Morningstar figure its ratings? Many investors turn to Morningstar when evaluating funds. The company has built an entire business on ratings, using the famous five-star system that many of us are familiar with. But while funds like to tout their ratings and investors rely on them to determine what constitutes a “good” fund, ratings may not be terribly significant. Funds with a three-year history all have ratings ranging from one star (lowest) to five stars (highest). To determine its star ratings, Morningstar looks at risk-adjusted trailing performance. As part of the formula, Morningstar does include costs, considering returns that come after fees are deducted. However, the fact that past performance is a huge part of Morningstar's rating system means that there is a big problem with how meaningful the ratings actually are. Past performance and future results Investors are familiar with this refrain: “Past performance does not guarantee future results.” This means it's necessary to question the weight of a star rating system that's based on what has happened in the past. If past performance can't be taken as an indicator of future results, Morningstar's ratings might not be as consequential as expected. However, past performance can provide clues about a company and its likely health. From that standpoint, looking into the past isn't a bad idea. But relying heavily on Morningstar ratings to help you choose a fund that will perform in the future might not be in the best interest of your investment portfolio. Could expense ratios be more meaningful? Instead of relying on Morningstar ratings, you might actually be better off checking expense ratios. Russel Kinnel, Morningstar Director of Research, has addressed the issue of star ratings vs. expense ratios. He basically hedged on the usefulness of the ratings from Morningstar and pointed out that expense ratios offer a better gauge of how a fund is likely to perform in the future. The problem is that many funds, especially index funds, are going to deliver average returns when compared to the market. A lower-cost fund, therefore, provides you with the best chance of doing well. When shopping around for a fund, therefore, you might be better off taking a look at the expense ratios, and not paying as much attention to what star rating Morningstar provided. Morningstar pros and cons Pros Pros Morningstar ratings: Investors around the world use Morningstar’s famous ratings to help them invest. Members can view ratings on all covered assets. Extensive research covering mutual funds, stocks, ETFs, and bonds: Morningstar reports include detailed analysis. Stock details include financials, dividends, ownership, valuations, and other data points. Fund reports look at holdings and performance and may include summaries from Morningstar analysis.

Coverage for more than 620,000 investments: That’s just a mind-boggling number of stocks and funds! If you can buy it through your brokerage, chances are Morningstar can tell you about it. Cons Cons Paid membership required for premium content: Basic accounts give you access to a little bit of what Morningstar has to offer to whet your appetite, but it’s far from a complete view of what the site gives to premium members. Annual membership is expensive: If you pay monthly, subscriptions cost",Morningstar Direct

Morningstar Review Morningstar offers a variety of investment and portfolio analysis tools. Analyzing stocks can be a time-consuming process. But for those who do it, there’s generally a passion associated with the process. While it would be great to have a team of analysts on your side to spread the workload around, that simply isn’t practical for the individual investor. Morningstar has the next best thing to a team of analysts. Its premium service, which recently rebranded and is now called Morningstar Investor, has already done much of the necessary analysis for stocks, ETFs, and funds. You just need to go through the analysis and decide if an investment has potential or not. In this article, we'll go through what Morningstar has to offer.

Why Should You Trust Us? Who is This For And Is It Worth It? Morningstar Features Who Is Morningstar? Morningstar is an investment rating platform for stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds. It's based in Chicago, IL, and was founded in 1984. Over the past 35+ years, it has developed a swath of independent research, ratings, and tools. Today, Morningstar is one of the most respected stock market analysis firms in the U.S. and is trusted by individuals and professional investors alike. Morningstar's workforce of more than 5,000 employees conduct research all over the world (in 27 countries) on over 620,000 investments. It also has about $215 billion in assets under management through its investment subsidiaries. What Do They Offer? Morningstar provides ratings and analysis on stocks and funds. Its ratings are widely quoted on other websites and sometimes in the financial media. The site is oriented towards fundamental investors. Fundamental investing is a type of analysis that looks at a company’s financials, management, industry, and growth prospects. This is in contrast to technical analysis, which analyzes stocks using charts. If you use purely technical analysis, Morningstar doesn’t really have anything to offer. Morningstar will save any fundamental investor a lot of time by providing high-quality analysis. Once you type in the symbol of a stock, ETF, or mutual fund, you'll see information at a glance that allows you to assess the asset quickly. From there, you can decide to move onto the next asset or dig deeper through Morningstar's commentary and other analysis features. Some of those other features include: Compare financials to competitors Current market price compared to fair value Percentage that price is over/undervalued Economic Moat Stewardship Portfolio Analysis Morningstar’s portfolio analysis tool is called X-Ray. It’s named X-Ray because it can look into your portfolio to determine if you have overexposure to some investments through duplicate holdings. For example, you might hold 10% Apple (AAPL) as a stock and not realize that you also have a fund that holds a large portion of AAPL. That means you're actually holding more than 10% in Apple. X-Ray will show the weighting for each position, which allows you to see if positions are properly weighted. You’ll also see the sectors your positions are in, geographic locations, interest rate sensitivity, valuation (growth vs. value scale), and more. X-ray does not offer insight into diversification, at least not from a modern portfolio theory perspective. In other words, it doesn’t provide any correlation information between investments in the portfolio. Screener A screener lets you put in certain characteristics of an asset and find those that match. The Morningstar screener is specific to the metrics provided by morningstar. Meaning, you can’t filter on broad metrics. You can filter on performance, analyst-grade ratings, or financials.

finance,"Financial management system overview
The earliest accounting records were found among the 7,000-year-old ruins of ancient Mesopotamia. This predates the invention of the wheel by over 3,000 years and speaks to the historical and cultural importance of trade and commerce in the evolution of human society. But it was not until the late 15th century that we saw the genesis of modern bookkeeping with the popularization of double-entry accounting by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli. With it, businesses could see both their present (debit) and future (credit) situation, and a rudimentary financial management system was born. Of course, modern financial management systems would be unrecognizable to signore Pacioli.
Financial management system definition
A financial management system is the software and processes used to manage income, expenses, and assets in an organization. In addition to supporting daily financial operations, the purpose of a financial management system is to maximize profits and ensure long-term enterprise sustainability. They help finance teams:
Streamline invoicing and bill collection
Optimize daily, monthly, and yearly cash flow
Maintain audit trails and comply with accounting regulations
Automate finance processes and reduce accounting errors
Deliver better budgeting, forecasting, and planning
Speed up financial close and reporting activities
And much more
Financial management software can be part of a company’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which consolidates financial and operational data and provides teams with a comprehensive view into the business. Standalone financial applications can also be combined to create an end-to-end financial management system. Increasingly, CFOs are choosing cloud-based ERP and financial management software that can rapidly scale to handle growth and provide functionality for different geographies, languages, currencies, and regulations.

General accounting and financial close: Tools for accounting and financial close support essential bookkeeping activities such as general ledger, accounts payable (AP), accounts receivable (AR), and payroll. They help teams generate reports, create financial statements for income, expenses, and balances – and close the books quickly and with less effort. Tax management features also help ensure tax accuracy and compliance.

Revenue, cash, and treasury management: With revenue accounting tools, finance teams can automate billing processes, view up-to-the-minute payments, and ensure compliance with statutory regulations for revenue recognition, such as IFRS 15. Cash and treasury management tools help teams predict cash flow, improve liquidity, and proactively mitigate risk. This software also integrates with banking systems, so users can get real-time visibility into bank balances and simplify reconciliation in accounts.
Financial planning and analysis: This set of planning, forecasting, budgeting, and analytical tools help CFOs and their teams support the company’s overall financial health. FP&A software is critical for analyzing costs and profitability, improving performance, predicting and navigating future conditions, and providing fast and accurate decision support to the C-suite. It also supports multi-scenario planning and collaboration between finance and every other department.
Governance, risk, and compliance: GRC tools help teams align organizational activities to business goals, identify and mitigate different types of risk, and ensure compliance with laws and regulations – from GDPR and SOX to international trade agreements. By synchronizing data across corporate governance, risk management, and compliance activities, companies can operate more efficiently, navigate uncertainty, and act with integrity.

Digital finance transformation and new technologies
Most companies are still in the early stages of applying digital technologies like cloud, augmented analytics, robotic process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain to finance processes – but they are on the cusp of a major shift and the pressure is on. Not only are CFOs and their teams increasingly expected to provide rapid decision support to the business, but hard lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic are forcing leaders to accelerate finance transformation and new technology adoption.
It’s easy to see why. The benefits of digital finance transformation – like instant intelligence, highly accurate predictive modeling, and more agile and automated processes – are the ingredients companies need to navigate change and adapt to the new normal. AI in particular is a driving force behind finance transformation, completely revolutionizing finance analytics, automation, and every process – from financial closing activities to risk mitigation and compliance.
In the coming decade, AI will optimize or transform nearly every activity in finance.
Gartner
Cloud financial management: In addition to scalability, cost-efficiency, and the ability to connect to more Big Data sources, cloud-based ERP financial management offers secure access to the system from anywhere – which is especially important now that so many employees are working remotely. The cloud is also the gateway – and prerequisite – to new and intelligent technologies like AI, machine learning, and blockchain.
Advanced finance analytics: Finance analytics powered by AI and machine learning can mine massive sets of structured and unstructured data – from inside and outside the organization – in near-real time. These analytics empower finance professionals to create more accurate forecasts and plans, model future scenarios, understand the financial impact of potential decisions, generate on-demand reports, and predict risk and opportunity. Ultimately, advanced finance analytics can be used to steer the business in the right direction and ensure long-term sustainability.
Finance automation: Ninety percent of corporate controllers will soon be using a combination of RPA and AI to automate everything from financial reports and closes to tax preparation and payroll. RPA bots not only automate repetitive tasks and free up workers to focus on higher-value work – they can complete more work faster, minimize costs and errors, optimize workflows, and orchestrate activities across human-bot teams.
Blockchain: In finance, blockchain technology offers new levels of transparency, efficiency, and security. For example, finance teams can use blockchain to create a single, immutable ledger that’s always up-to-date and doesn’t require reconciliations. Blockchain-based smart contracts – contracts that automatically execute once predetermined conditions are met – can also be used to automate and accelerate activities like payment processing and regulatory compliance.

What Was SAP BPC Used For?
SAP BPC
For decades, global organizations have relied on solutions such as SAP BPC for global consolidations and planning processes. SAP BPC had built-in financial intelligence to streamline consolidations so that Finance could produce consolidated Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow statements. In addition, SAP BPC had built-in planning capabilities (e.g., spreading) to streamline the planning user input during planning processes.
However, SAP BPC never delivered on the promise of one solution. Most customers needed to manage separate consolidation and planning applications. Then, these applications would need to be integrated. Additional applications were often needed to bring everything together for analysis and variance reporting.
SAP BPC Key Features
SAP BPC is known for several key capabilities:
Financial Consolidation: Facilitates financial consolidation processes, helping companies streamline reporting, eliminate errors and stay compliant with regulatory requirements
Financial Planning: Enables business planning to create detailed budgets and forecasts, incorporating various factors (e.g., historical data, market trends and business objectives)
Workflow: Automates workflow processes related to planning, budgeting and consolidation, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency
Reporting and Analysis: Delivers reporting and analysis capabilities, allowing users to generate customizable reports, perform ad-hoc analysis and gain insights into financial performance
Data Integration: Integrates with various data sources – including ERP systems, databases and spreadsheets – bringing all financial data for consolidations, planning, reporting and analysis into one solution
SAP BPC Pros

Xero provides automatic bank account reconciliations. A Xero Central support article for Bank Reconciliation describes the bank account reconciliation process: “The aim of bank reconciliation in Xero is to match each statement line in the bank account to an existing transaction in Xero, or create a transaction during the reconciliation process. Statement lines are the bank transactions imported from your bank account via a bank feed or they’re manually imported. When they’re in your online banking, they’re referred to as bank transactions, then when they’re imported into Xero we call them bank statement lines.”

How to Implement & Use Xero?

finance,"Xero Accounting Review 2024: Pricing, Features, Alternatives This cloud-based accounting software supports unlimited users on all of its subscription plans. Many or all of the products featured here are from our partners who compensate us. This influences which products we write about and where and how the product appears on a page. However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money. Xero is a cloud-based accounting software product that’s easy to use and integrates with more than 1,000 apps. It’s less expensive than competitors like QuickBooks Online and doesn’t charge extra for additional users, making it an affordable option for growing businesses and one of NerdWallet’s picks for best accounting software for small businesses. Cons : Doesn't provide a customer support phone number, but will call you if necessary. Limits on bills and invoices with the entry-level plan. Xero at a glance Key features Has robust reporting tools and report customization options, basic inventory tracking in all plans and a capable mobile app; Early plan limits the number of invoices and bills. Ease of use Includes tools that help automate the reconciliation process, along with a global search function; has a simple layout and a customizable dashboard. Scalability All three plans include an unlimited number of users. Ease of sharing with accountants Includes audit trails and easy accountant access; although the product is gaining popularity in the U.S., it’s less popular than some competitors like QuickBooks. Integrations Integrates with more than 1,000 apps. Customer support Does not provide a phone number to customers but a representative will call you if necessary; no live chat support. Cost Plans are affordable, starting at $13 per month, but no free plan. Advanced features Includes project tracking tools in most expensive plan; has transaction tracking tags; lacks industry-specific reports; users with multiple businesses must pay for separate subscriptions.",XERO
finance,"How does Xero work? After you start a free 30-day trial of Xero, you’ll activate the account and provide details about your business. Then, you can connect your bank accounts to Xero and decide if you'll accept electronic payments for online invoices. When reconciling books, Xero suggests likely matches between bank statement lines and transactions entered in the software. For example, if you have an entry for an invoice of $1,000 and a recent $1,000 deposit in your bank account, it might suggest matching these two transactions. Click the ""OK"" icon between the two to verify the match is correct. Pricing and features Promotional discounts may apply. Xero lets new customers sign up for a 30-day free trial to test out its features. You can add Gusto payroll to any plan for an extra $40 per month, plus $6 per month per person. Plan Pricing Features Early $13 per month. Send quotes and up to 20 invoices. Enter up to five bills. Automated bill and receipt capture with Hubdoc. Reconcile bank transactions and set up online bank feeds. Basic inventory management. Reporting. Send purchase orders. Growing $37 per month. All features in the Early plan, plus: Unlimited invoices, quotes and bill entries. Ability to bulk reconcile transactions. Established $70 per month. All features in the Growing plan, plus: Works with multiple currencies. Project tracking tools for recording time and breaking down job costs. Claim expenses. Advanced analytics tools for predicting future cash flow, up to 90 days ahead. Benefits Unlimited users With Xero, you can add an unlimited number of users to your account at each subscription level. This is a notable feature for accounting software; often, lower-tier plans allow fewer users while only higher-tier plans allow unlimited users. You can also set permission levels for each user. For example, you can give all employees the ability to send quotes and invoices, allow some to enter expenses and limit who can see the company’s complete financial picture. To keep things organized, Xero logs every action users make and compiles the history of every transaction. Customizable reports and dashboards Xero helps transform the data you enter into actionable information at every subscription level. A dashboard provides a summary of your business’s financial health, including total cash in and out, outstanding invoices and overdue bills. Another page dedicated to short-term cash flow charts out how future bills and invoices can affect your bank balance over the next week or month. Reports also are customizable, with adjustable formatting and the option to add your own formulas and groupings. For instance, you can drag and drop certain expense categories into a single subgroup — an “office expenses” subgroup could include office equipment, supplies and utilities. And if you don’t like how the dashboard looks, you can reorganize panels and hide the ones that aren’t useful. Easy to use Users that are new to bookkeeping won’t be overwhelmed by Xero’s simple and easy-to-navigate layout. This layout makes the reconciliation process, among other accounting tasks, particularly easy. The software shows you potential transaction matches side by side, so you can immediately see if the match is accurate without having to click anything. Drawbacks One-way phone support Xero doesn’t provide a phone number on its customer support page, but a representative will call you if necessary. This is a serious drawback if you want to be able to pick up the phone and talk through an issue or are new to accounting software and have lots of questions. Instead, customers can visit the Xero Central support site or raise a case online. A representative typically responds to a case within a few hours. Limits on bills and invoices in the entry-level plan In the Early plan, the least expensive subscription, you can send up to 20 invoices and schedule up to five bill payments only. That can be limiting, even for freelancers and sole proprietors. For unlimited invoicing and bill-paying capacity, you'll need to upgrade to the Growing plan.",XERO

finance,"Cons: User interface takes a while to get used to Receipt scanning is reportedly slow according to some users Report labelling Automatic reminders for submissions/approvals Sending the expenses to be approved is somewhat confusing for new users Having a default expenses payer is glitchy. Once you submit your expense, it is not submitted. You have to double back to your ""home"" and go from there actually to submit the expense. I do wish that as those on the team are approving finances, it would tell you if someone has looked at it. Not just say it's approved. Their pricing model is very complicated and keeps changing Their customer service has deteriorated in the past two years Pushing other products, such as their credit card, on customers by preventing them from keeping their current plans unless they include and pay for the new service. Improving integration with endpoint mailer ecosystem Improving SSO features Improving integrated feed broadcast to reporting managers It cannot filter out projects by status so even closed out project still appear available for employees to charge expenses to They push their Expensify card on the users They are expensive and raising prices They could also improve on having a better expense summary report They could have a better web application Expensify could have better customer service Web experience could've been better. I preferred the mobile experience. Pricing model was confusing & seemed to change a lot. They push their products a lot. Web based version has a lot going on and you can be distracted. The smartscan feature can be 50/50 at times. Perhaps they can provide more guidance on how to have a more successful scan? Keeping their political opinions out of it. I shouldn't be emailed and told to vote for a certain candidate like they chose to do before the presidential election. I didn't sign up for Fox News or CNN. Uploading duplicate charges. Duplicate charges are flagged, but sometimes I have multiple expenses for the same dollar amount and the same company. To get around this, I change the cents a bit ($19.99 for one and $20.01 or another). Every once in a while it gets a little buggy when uploading a receipt, and I have to press the back button and start again. This is pretty rare though. In my experience, we have had so many problems within only 3 months of using and still have no resolution despite reaching out to your ""support"" on a weekly basis. I feel support cannot be bothered to have more than a chat conversation despite continued complex issues that cannot be clearly communicated or resolved via text and require a phone conversation. Keep getting ""duplicate"" transactions, one showing as a credit card and one as cash. No resolution from previously suggested actions from your ""support"" team Transactions from a card that is not connected in Expensify are coming through onto a report despite us never integrating or connecting that card on purpose. No resolution for that despite numerous contacts with ""support"" Negligence of stated features per the contract which I believe you have violated Card transactions from 1 employee's card will show on a different employee's report as a cash transaction. Smart scan fails too often. It would be great if there was a REQUIRED date of purchase AI recognition. It would be helpful if employees could have designated departments/classes so the expenses would automatically code to the correct department. As an admin user adding approvers to new users seems cumbersome and error-ridden. When I try to add approvers to new employees, often times, the field is blacked out or not even an option. It would be great if we could easily deactivate users without going through multiple steps. I would like to be able to delete reports from the inbox that are old/and not correct instead of having to request the submitter to do so. I can hardly see the buttons on the filters in the inbox and the expenses list. It would be nice to be able to filter by approver. I don't like that user names aren't uniform. Why do some users have their email address as their username, and some people have their actual name (First and Last). In my opinion, billing policies are deceptive and inflexible. To me the system is clunky overall. Was hard to figure out how to configure properly My team were not big fans of the report submission process. Streamlining function between addons/modules. Receipt capture/uploading is sometimes buggy. Account management can be buggy, non-descript error messages are commonplace when trying to make changes or update information. Support is a Teams-like chat interface that is bot-monitored. Takes time to get in touch with live help. In my opinion, Support is deceptive and non-transparent regarding options related to billing. Foreign currencies exchange rate tied to a bank and/or credit card Linking of credit card to Expensify Grouping of monthly expense reports Make it easier to submit multiple receipts/files in one expense Often times I get a warning that the value of a receipt doesn't match what I manually I inputted. So making Smart scanner a little smarter, essentially. It would be fun to see stats about my expenses Some analytics would be helpful when reviewing at year-end Entering multiple similar expenses has improved, but could be made easier Consolidating duplicates from different sources such as email and credit card, can be confusing how we download receipts options to type in own expenses Ability to default dashboard to expenses view add few pitures (not just one) for one single expense add possibility to attach a simple mail to a single expense the lent funcion on the attached file expense is not the best Integration with banking systems to improve expense tracking.",Expensify

finance,"As a business owner, you want to make things as simple as possible, right? After all, why would you want to do things the hard way?! When working on processes for accounting, it seems that sometimes there is no easy way to do things, especially when it comes to the dreaded end-of-the-month expense reporting. If you can relate, we have good news for you! There is a solution to your problem, which is called Expensify! Now you are probably asking, “what is Expensify used for?” Great question! Expensify makes it easy to track expenses, submit expense reports, pay bills, generate invoices, collect payments, and track mileage! Are you ready to say “see ya later” to those piles of receipts you have shoved in your purse, dashboard, and drawers? If so, keep reading to see how Expensify can revolutionize your expense reporting! What Is Expensify? We mentioned above what solutions Expensify brings to the table in terms of expense reporting and more, but let’s dive into what Expensify is and how you can utilize it to streamline your pre-accounting process! Expensify is a cloud-based platform or “app” that is designed to streamline the business expense process to save you time and money! According to a survey conducted by Expensify, users take 83% less time performing those expense reporting tasks by using their platform! How long does it take you to perform your business expense reporting now? Just think about how much time you can get back by utilizing this advanced platform. Oh, and did we mention that it is extremely user-friendly despite its advanced and intelligent technology? Once you set the processes like approval workflows and purchasing policies, it is smooth sailing from there. It can also be integrated with QuickBooks, so everything is compiled in one place. There are quite a few different features of this platform so let’s take a closer look at some of these tips on Expensify and how to use it! what is expensify used for How Does Expensify Work? Expensify is loaded with features that make expense reporting a breeze, including: One-Click Receipt Scanning This is probably our favorite of all the features that Expensify has. Remember how we talked about those receipts stuffed into purses and cars? That is now a thing of the past, thanks to Expensify on mobile. Going forward, as soon as you receive your receipt, you can open the SmartScan app on your smartphone, take a picture of it, and let the system do the rest! It automatically saves a copy of the receipt and uploads the important information into an expense report. Expensify also offers a card that you can connect, and by using that, you can cut out the SmartScan process completely! Never having to scan, copy or find a receipt again? That is revolutionary. Budget Setting and Workflow Approvals You can automatically set what is approved for purchases on the card, as well as set a spending limit every time an employee sets out on a business trip. You can set limits on food spending, travel, and entertainment. The system even notifies employees after they upload their receipts to let them know how close to the budget they are. Does your business need several people to sign off on a purchase to ensure that it falls under the company’s purchasing policies? If a purchase made on the card needs to be approved by several people, it will start a chain reaction and notify those specific people that a charge needs reviewing. This helps to avoid fraud and keeps an eye on purchases that truly should be reimbursed. Apps like Expensify help you save a lot of time while also reducing the manual steps you need to take in your business. Instead of having to manually go through approvals or other workflows, Expensify will work with you to make the process as fluid and effortless as possible. And, there’s also a credit card import feature that allows you to: Import business cards Import personal cards Automate receipt coding and merging Corporate reconciliation is also built into the platform, which will allow you to review all of the unsubmitted expenses and confirm statements right from Expensify. Mileage Tracking If you or your employees travel in personal vehicles to different locations for your business, tracking mileage can be cumbersome. You’ve probably tried tracking it on your phone, using a spreadsheet, or other “organizational” methods to track your miles accurately. The Expensify app’s GPS capabilities can automatically track your mileage from beginning to end of the trip and calculate the mileage expense for easy reporting. Audit and Compliance Duplicate receipts and transactions can quickly turn your books inaccurate. Expensify empowers you by offering duplicate receipt detection automatically, and you can even verify: Each transaction Exchange rates And more PCI-compliance is also built-in, so you have peace of mind that your banking data is protected. And now, Expensify uses AI-powered receipt auditing to ensure compliance. Their auditing services will automatically: Ensure exchange rates are correct Detect duplicate receipts Confirm that each transaction is accurate It does all of this with the power of AI technology. Integrations Expensify syncs automatically with your accounting system, HR software and the rest of your tech stack to save you even more time. Integrations include: Expensify empowers you to create custom approval workflows that align with your business’s needs. You can even customize your expense policy rules to flag certain types of expenses for review. Want To Know More About What Expensify Is Used For? Connect With Redmond Accounting!

finance,"The bottom line: Expensify is a fantastic, fully automated expense-tracking service with extremely comprehensive corporate plans.
While Expensify’s individual, sole proprietor, and small-business plans are well worth the price, Expensify is geared towards bigger corporations that want hefty expense solutions for multiple users. Its free plan for businesses includes corporate card management, employee reimbursement, invoicing, and bill management. It’s affordable, comprehensive, and well-suited to companies where multiple employees submit expenses. Expensify pros Thoroughly automated expense tracking and categorization
proHighly rated iOS and Android apps
proFree plans for individuals, sole proprietors, and some businesses
proSeamless integration with third-party accounting software Expensify cons
conMonth-to-month plans double the cost of annual plans
conHigher software learning curve than some competitors Expensify’s key features
As an expense-management and receipt-scanning solution, Expensify’s main feature is its high-quality mobile receipt scanning and automatic expense categorization. These features remain the same regardless of the plan you pick: whether you’re a sole proprietor uploading a few receipts a month or the leader of a corporation where every manager has corporate card access, Expensify gives you the same fantastic receipt scans and detailed expense categorization. The most notable aspect of Expensify's receipt scanning and uploading is probably its ability to translate the most illegible numbers into easy-to-categorize data. Zoho Expense comes close, but no one else rivals Expensify’s optical character recognition (OCR) technology.
Honestly, with Expensify, you can aim your phone’s camera at any crumpled up piece of paper. As long as there’s a number somewhere on the page, Expensify can translate it into an accurate expense amount, then categorize it correctly (for instance, as a food or travel expense). Let's be clear: a receipt scan can mean using your phone to snap a picture of a physical receipt, then uploading it to your Expensify account. But it’s the 21st century, and Expensify uploads and categorizes all types of receipts: Emailed receipts (forwarded to your Expensify account) Screen shots
Credit card account syncing
Third-party app uploads (via Evernote, Dropbox, and so on)
Every Expensify plan also includes automatic mileage tracking, basic bill management, and invoicing. The free business plan adds corporate card access via the Expensify Card, as well as employee expense reimbursement.
Those basic plans are perfect for sole proprietors, solopreneurs, freelancers, and small-business owners with a handful of employees. They can also work nicely for partnerships where both business owners need corporate card access. But like we said above, Expensify is ideal for bigger business and corporations that want thoroughly automated expense tracking across their entire company.

How do customers benefit from using your app?
With Expensify, people spend less time working on expense reports and more time pursuing their real goals. We make it super easy for employees to submit expenses and get reimbursed ASAP.

For finance admins, we make sure that all expense reports are compliant with company policies and submitted on time, which provides them with realtime insights into company finances. We also offer a partnership program for accountants, streamlining the relationship between our accounting partners and their clients so accountants no longer have to chase down their clients for receipts every month – they spend more time advising their clients and less time doing grunt work.

Who’s your competition and how is your app different?
Our two biggest competitors are pockets full of receipts and Excel spreadsheets. Believe it or not, the majority of businesses still track expenses the old-fashioned way -- crumpled receipts and manual spreadsheets. As far as other receipt and expense apps go -- well, business apps are only effective if people actually use them. Some expense management apps are so clunky, employees avoid submitting expense reports for months. Expensify prioritizes the employee experience, so people not only use our app, they genuinely love it -- and then they can put it away and forget about expenses. How and why did Expensify get started?
Expensify was founded in 2008 by David Barrett who always hated expense reports and wanted to make them suck less. For more on what happened between then and now, check out “How We Got Here.” Where is your company based?

finance,"Cons : Some lack of flexibility in reporting. Lack of ability to print reports from analytics.
The application occasionally will show some instability, but this has been vastly improved over earlier versions. There are recovery routines so most of the data is not lost. The crashes seem mostly due to print driver compatabilities. The developers are pretty good at fixing these issues. Large, complicated formulas may run into size limits when calculating dollar outcomes. When this occurs, I have created interim formulas in a workbook to get to the final formula. It's nice that the application has supplementary schedules for the P&L. However there are no such supporting schedules for the balance sheet. Much of the work I do is in the balance sheet. It would nice to have a supporting schedule that would clean up the balance sheet presentation. The learning curve can be a little steep for the novice user. The application was developed by CPAs for CPAs, although this application is valuable for private companies.
We have had some issues where we setup multiple user accounts and they share some of the same files. I think they may have some glitches in the software as everyone had the same access but certain individuals were not able to create copies or new documents from the same exact file. It would be great if this product was built as a web/browser-based product, rather than a local client install. Then the users could also save on the cost of the remote cloud desktop, and installation/connectivity should be easier. There should really be a ""mass-refresh"" button/method in the Excel add-in that would refresh every tab at once. A ""mass-consolidation"" button in the PlanGuru application would be nice, too. I wish there was a ""help forum"" where users could assist one another and help troubleshoot issues. Support is responsive, and the videos are great. But support can't answer you as fast as a forum search would, and the videos don't cover everything. Chances are SOMEONE has had the same question in the past.

CPE course (http://www.planguru.com/products/cpe-signup.html#).
In our experience, engagements for Prospective Financial Analysis typically consist of five phases*:
1.) Articulating the value proposition: In this phase you explain the importance of these exercises to your client,
noting that when done right the benefits greatly exceed the costs.
2.) Gathering Information/ data: By asking the right questions you will be able to gather the relevant data and
qualitative information, getting you to the core of your client’s needs.
3.) Constructing the Model: With requirements and data in hand you can build a model that satisfies your client’s
needs and can be used consistently moving forward.
4.) Analyzing/ Ongoing Maintenance: Perform strategic planning exercises or establish a recurring monthly budget
and review process.
5.) Creating Deliverables: With the analysis complete you must produce the correct reports and charts.
*Not necessarily in this order. If they are an existing client and you already have the data, it might make sense to
build a sample model (without laboring over the assumptions) as part of the “Articulating the Value” phase.
For the last 13 years PlanGuru has helped lower the cost of delivering these services by streamlining phases 3, 4 & 5;
the PlanGuru Process Module will assist you with phases 1 & 2. Efficiently navigating the first two phases is often the
greatest hurdle to acquiring and performing a profitable budgeting/ forecasting/ planning engagement.
The PlanGuru Process contains 3 key documents:
Financial Professionals
1.) Pitch Decks: The Pitch Decks are a set of PowerPoint slides that help articulate the benefits of budgeting &
planning to your client.
2.) Advisor Notes: Use these to help ask the right questions that facilitate effective discussions.
3.) Assumptions Templates: These will help you efficiently gather the more detailed information required to build
the financial analysis.
The simple act of completing these forms will go a long way toward understanding your client’s needs and goals. We
recommend that you perform this exercise collaboratively with your client; however, the individual circumstances will
dictate the correct approach.

Business budgeting, forecasting
and planning software
Flexibility
The flexibility of PlanGuru is one of its greatest strengths. The application is used by start-ups with no recorded sales
as well as mature companies with hundreds of millions in revenue. Auto-body shops, bio-techs and major universities,
despite their dissimilarities all effectively use PlanGuru to meet their budgeting and forecasting needs. Like our
software, these resources are designed to be used on all types of engagements and for all types of companies.
We encourage you to take your clients through the full “PlanGuru Process”, but it is up to you to decide what is appropriate for each situation. Thus you can pick and choose the slides, templates and case studies that fit each of your
clients’ individual needs. For these reasons we provide the process materials in Excel, PowerPoint or PlanGuru Files
and encourage you to adapt these materials to fit your client base and business model.
Growing this Resource:
We plan to expand “The PlanGuru Process” materials over time. The current materials only encompass the “Core”
module. Over time, we plan to develop sub modules (break-even analysis, valuation, scenario analysis) that can be
integrated into the Core materials as needed for each of your clients. If you have suggestions or would like to share
your thoughts on additional materials, please email christian@planguru.com.
1.) Pitch Decks
The expression, “you don’t know what you don’t know,” applies to most small businesses who are not budgeting and
planning. Sometimes it can be difficult to articulate the causal linkage between building a financial model and
maximizing profitability. The Pitch Decks will help you demonstrate the relationship between improved insight and
better decision making, thereby enhancing your client’s perceived benefit.
It explains and differentiates prospective financial analysis types (Deliverables, Strategic, and Operational) and the
circumstances where each is applicable. Three downloadable case studies are available; these will help your client
draw parallels to their own business and communicate important concepts.
The goal of these slides is to get your client excited about making better decisions through your collaborative work with
PlanGuru. Once the client is interested you can start asking questions and propose a practical solution using the
Advisor Notes.
2.) Advisor Notes
The first tab of the Advisor Notes starts with a series of high level questions intended to help you assess the client’s
“PFA Needs” (as discussed in the Pitch Deck). Once you understand the needs and priorities you can start to formulate
the kind of analysis that is most relevant.
With a project outline in place, having a well thought out method for gathering requirements will save you a great deal
of time. With less up front ambiguity you will reduce the back-and-forth effort and most importantly minimize the
chance of re-works. The Advisor Notes drive fruitful high-level discussions by walking your clients through all the right
questions, in the appropriate order.
The notes contain a questions sheet that is designed to be printed and shared with everyone. On the right side of the
sheet, outside of the print range, you will find guidance notes that are written from the perspective of a financial
professional; you may want to retain these for yourself.
2
3.) Assumption Templates
With an intelligent outline in place the Assumptions Templates will help gather more specific information. It will assist
in answering questions about how to build up to the total financial picture of your client’s business (by department/
division/ location/ etc.) as well as assumptions for the behavior of financial statement line items. Think of the
Assumption Templates as a procedure for vetting the more detailed and nuanced questions. In most cases it will be
appropriate to share these documents with your clients.
Your Role as a Financial Professional
When building a projection for a small business or an entrepreneur your role is often clear… do everything. With
limited complexity and PlanGuru available as your tool, these cases are straightforward. In larger more involved
organizations this task is not so cut and dry.
In larger enterprises with additional complexity, you will never develop an effective financial management system if the
client is not committed to the project. Your role may change based on your client’s: goals, willingness to participate,
constructive input of multiple key employees, and how much they are willing to pay for these services.
As a financial professional and trusted advisor part of your role is raising awareness and steering your clients clear of
the common implementation pitfalls. Based on our experience incomplete requirements and inadequate client
participation are the most common and adverse roadblocks. By being up front with your client you will improve the
outcome of the project and will be held accountable for only the portions of the project that you can control. This
system is a framework to help cover your bases and vet these difficult issues up front to maximize you client’s
satisfaction with the project.",PlanGuru
finance,"Overall I have great experience with Plan Guru and will recommend to other users. PlanGuru is good software. One of its key advantages is you can import all your data from any accounting system, and it is really user-friendly software. Perhaps, the tool’s greatest benefit lies in its ability to automate and simplify complex budgeting and forecasting practices. That it does this without the help of messy and unwieldy excel sheets is fantastic. I was annoyed when I learned that my software was shut down remotely when PlanGuru adopted an annual license fee after several years of no fees, unless you opted in for an upgrade to a new version. Has no flexibility for FX management. I have a number of expenses in CAD, and revenues in USD, and I don't have the flexibility to see the impact of FX. Limited forecasting years. Difficult to make 3 year forecast. It was glitchy at times by not importing excel sheets or causing errors. It would be great if this product was built as a web/browser-based product, rather than a local client install. Then the users could also save on the cost of the remote cloud desktop, and installation/connectivity should be easier. There should really be a ""mass-refresh"" button/method in the Excel add-in that would refresh every tab at once. A ""mass-consolidation"" button in the PlanGuru application would be nice, too. I wish there was a ""help forum"" where users could assist one another and help troubleshoot issues. Support is responsive, and the videos are great. But support can't answer you as fast as a forum search would, and the videos don't cover everything. Chances are SOMEONE has had the same question in the past. Not flexible on data assumptions on each year, not probably formulated on depreciation calculation PlanGuru is a wonderful tool that makes it extremely easy for small businesses to budget projects as well as determine how well the projects are doing. PlanGuru is extremely easy to use and integrate with software like Quickbooks. The customization of everything on plan Guru is immense and extremely flexible. Overall, PlanGuru is easy to use and wonderful to have. The cash-flow forecasting is key to our company, along with the forecasting and budgeting abilities for original forecast, revised and actual, along with the reporting capabilities.",PlanGuru
finance,"PlanGuru is a budgeting software that houses intermediate and advanced features in small business budgeting. It uses trends, historical averages, and growth rates to forecast values and present them in a budget. It also generates multiyear budgets for long-term planning and pro forma financial statements for a complete financial budget.
Pricing starts at $99 per month for one user. Based on our expert PlanGuru review, we recommend it for small businesses wanting to take budgeting seriously through PlanGuru’s sophisticated forecasting and report building features.Why We Like PlanGuru
PlanGuru offers a diverse set of tools for intermediate or advanced budgeting. Its forecasting and projection methods make budgeting faster and more approximate with the use of quantitative techniques. It also performs a three-way analysis for the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.
Another great feature of PlanGuru is its report builder tool. This tool doesn’t only present data in a tabular format but also creates graphs and charts that are not present in the software we reviewed in our list of the best small business budgeting software.
PlanGuru Pricing
The PlanGuru pricing page shows two plans. Both contain all of PlanGuru’s features, but the entry-level subscription is limited in terms of the number of users and departments:
Single Entity: $99 per month for one user and one department
Multi-Department Consolidations: $299 per month for three users and unlimited departments
You can add more seats at $29 per user monthly. There is no free trial, but PlanGuru offers a money-back guarantee if you cancel within 30 days.
PlanGuru Features
PlanGuru has a set of features that work in unison when you create a budget. Each feature discussed below contributes to the final budget and relieves manual work on your part.
Forecasting & Modeling
Most of the forecasts are present in the income statement. PlanGuru has different forecasting methods available, and it’s up to you which method you think is best for a specific budget line item. Don’t restrict yourself to one method. You can use all kinds of methods as long as they make sense and provide an approximate forecast of future outcomes.
First, let’s discuss the basic methods: manual entry, percent of other accounts, growth rate, and historical trend or average. We’ll discuss assumptions and KPIs in the next section.
Image showing all the forecasting methods on PlanGuru.
PlanGuru Forecasting Methods
Manual
Percent of Other Accounts
Growth Rate
Historical Trend
This is the most basic forecasting method on PlanGuru. You can enter amounts directly into cells and apply a monthly amount or an annual amount. Manual entry is also the most flexible since you get to plug in the figure. Use this method only if you know the exact amount of income or expense for a particular month. The best use of the manual will be for recording rent expense since rent remains fixed throughout the year. PlanGuru Ease of Use
PlanGuru has a modern-looking and uncomplicated user interface (UI). We recommend that you allot some time to explore and familiarize yourself with all of its features. Although it will provide upfront training for new users, we strongly recommend that you watch the tutorials on its website to refresh your knowledge after the user training.
When making budgets, the platform will highlight the modifiable cells in yellow, making it easy for you to spot cells. Cells with no highlights can’t be modified or are functions of other cells. If you want to add more line items, you right-click and select Add New Account, and a new line item will appear.
Another boost to PlanGuru’s ease of use is its Pro Advisor program. PlanGuru trains and certifies finance and accounting professionals. PlanGuru Pro Advisors can provide professional guidance to users who require expert help. We recommend hiring a Pro Advisor if you don’t know how to use budgeting software.
PlanGuru Reviews From Users
Those who left PlanGuru reviews said that the software is value for money and is outstanding in terms of ease of use. Users appreciate how the provider is receptive to user feedback and suggestions for improvement and new features. They also like the Excel add-on feature since they can utilize Excel pivot tables for creating dashboards.
Meanwhile, those with negative reviews complained about bugs within the system. They also mentioned that PlanGuru lacks integrations to other software other than Xero, QuickBooks Online, and Excel. Overall, PlanGuru garnered the following scores on these third-party review sites:
GetApp1: 4.2 out of 5 stars based on around 50 reviews
G22: 4.5 out of 5 stars based on about 20 reviews PlanGuru is a great tool for budgeting and forecasting. It uses sophisticated techniques and provides builder tools to enable users to create their assumptions and formulas. Overall, we highly recommend PlanGuru for small businesses wanting to take budgeting seriously. It’s a good solution to get if you already have QuickBooks Online or Xero as your main accounting software.

finance,"Less a business plan creator than a financial reporting tool, PlanGuru nevertheless does a creditable job for those seeking to build a worthwhile business plan document. Still, rank beginners or those less focused on financial calculations might need to look elsewhere. MSRP $99.00 PlanGuru from PlanGuru LLC is more focused on delivering business budgeting tools than it is on helping you create a business plan for a start-up or existing small business. It begins at $99 per year for a single-user license ($29 per month for every additional user beyond the first) and is availalbe in two versions, one for businesess and nonprofits and the other for accounts and financial advisors. An annual plan is available for both of these audiences at $899 per year with another $299 per year charged for every additional user after the first one. There are also two solution versions: first, PlanGuru Launch, which has the PlanGuru team helping you implement and most effectively leverage the company's software; second, PlanGuru Analyst, which is a turnkey service that has PlanGuru personnel building and maintaining your organization's budgets and related reporting. Though it can help you create a business plan, the real forte of PlanGuru is in budgeting and forecasting cash flow. Similar to how OnePlace (Visit Site at OnePlace) focuses on project management and collaboration, PlanGuru seems more focused on finance and forecasting than on straight business plan creation. For this reason, it comes up short against dedicated business plan writing tools such as Editors' Choice winners Tarkenton GoSmallBiz (Visit Site at Tarkenton) and Palo Alto Software LivePlan ($19.95 at LivePlan) . You Can Trust Our Reviews Since 1982, PCMag has tested and rated thousands of products to help you make better buying decisions. Read our editorial mission & see how we test. Getting Started Unlike most of our contenders, such as Palo Alto Software LivePlan, PlanGuru isn't a cloud-based app, instead offering desktop or local network installation options. After installing the software on your PC, you tell PlanGuru the basics about your company and it prompts you for whether you want to use account masks, which I found a bit confusing at first. An account mask is basically a set of numbers, letters, and question marks that are used to define an account number (such as 100.???.??.??). The company offers a series of online help videos, though, to familiarize you with how to use the software. Also pointing to an orientation aimed at advanced users, PlanGuru assumes you have basic accounting and finance knowledge. This definitely isn't a beginner's tool, but it is aimed at experienced small business operators, so don't think you need to be an accountant to get the most from PlanGuru. During setup, PlanGuru asks if you want to perform an analysis, and if you should include a balance sheet and what your cash flow method is, direct or indirect. In response, it'll produce a spreadsheet showing information such as your total cost of sales, operating expenses, income before taxes, and provision for taxes. You can look at your cash flows and balance sheet as well as some nonfinancial data. The software will display spreadsheets analyzing various ratios, including liquidity, efficiency, coverage profitability and operating ratios. For more sophisticated analytics, you can upload data to a related program called PlanGuru Analytics. Varied Pricing Every available iteration of PlanGuru has support for importing Microsoft Excel ($99 Per Year at Microsoft 365 for Business) and Intuit QuickBooks along with help videos to walk you through the process. Unfortunately, those are the only two third-party imports available. No other data collection tool nor any other popular small to midsized business (SMB) accounting system is supported for import in PlanGuru. That's not too bad a problem initially, if you're focused on simply building a basic business planning document; but, if you want to leverage your business plan as a long-term tracking tool (which you should), then having broader support for popular SMB accounting or business intelligence applications, like FreshBooks or Microsoft Power BI would prove very useful. An add-on product, the aforementioned PlanGuru Analytics, which includes a dashboard, the ability to custom-define key performance indicators, and more detailed views of financial performance, costs $19.95 per month per user. This tool is aimed not only at business executives but also directly at financial professionals and CPAs to help them advise and analyze their business customers' operations. Those interested in PlanGuru Analytics might also want to look at PlanGuru's Advanced Reporting Excel Add-in, which allows you to create more advanced reports using Excel as the data manipulation tool and PlanGuru as the source. Moreso than business plan writing aids, PlanGuru seems to compete most directly with budgeting programs such as BudgetMaestro and Adaptive Insights. The program is designed to handle multiple departments and locations and do rolling forecasts of cash flow from month to month. For a start-up business, it can produce a statement of cash flows along with an income statement and balance sheet to provide information to a lender that is financing the business. The program can calculate the growth rate of the business and historical trends. Tools are available for accrued expenses, prepaid accounts, and lines of credit. Tellingly, one tool lets you choose from 19 different forecasting methods for different sections of the income statement and balance sheet. You can build a budget for the rest of the year and compare the actual results month by month while doing rolling forecasts. Account numbers can be brought in from QuickBooks or Excel. The company intends to add integrations with additional products next year. The program can also handle consolidations, though it's not ideal for companies with hundreds of departments and locations. Performance Measurement and Reporting The PlanGuru Analytics tool does performance measurement and reporting. You can configure different types of dashboards to show various types of ratios and report on metrics such as budgeted versus actual results. The software lets you look at data like units sold, head count, and billable hours. You can budget salaries person by person and revenues customer by customer. It will highlight variances and identify trends, graphing them if you want. The Advanced Excel Reporting tool is also helpful for building customized reports. The software lets you export reports to Excel. PlanGuru also works with providers of outsourced CFO services such as an accounting firm that wants to use the product to manage a client's business. Overall, while PlanGuru offers some great help for folks writing the finance and forecasting portions of their business plans, it's obviously aimed at more of an accounting and finance user base rather than entrepreneurs looking to get their thoughts on paper for team members and investors. THE BOTTOM LINE Less a business plan creator than a financial reporting tool, PlanGuru nevertheless does a creditable job for those seeking to build a worthwhile business plan document. Still, rank beginners or those less focused on financial calculations might need to look elsewhere.",PlanGuru

finance,"14 Undeniable Benefits of Power BI that you should know in 2023 The rapidly booming global business intelligence market is growing at a CAGR of 8.7%. It is expected to reach $43.4 billion by 2028, as per the Business Intelligence Market report by Fortune Business Insights. Big data—a trendy term in business circles—inculcates information that a business collects, stores, and keeps growing daily. But not all businesses can tap into the data to maximize their business. The prime reason is that the data gets stored in various apps, databases, spreadsheets, and third-party platforms, making it challenging to access and report. Microsoft Power BI aims to solve these issues, and in this blog, we will find out its top undeniable benefits that you must know in 2023. Why Power BI? Data is supreme; thus, businesses must have the proper tools and resources to make meaning of it all. Microsoft Power BI has been disrupting the business intelligence market with various features to handle data analytics, visualization, and BI needs. That is because it can cater to the BI needs of large enterprises and small businesses alike. Complexities and high costs circling business intelligence and analytics solutions earlier restricted BI for large enterprises mostly. But with evolved features involving self-service capabilities and affordable pricing, Power BI is there for every business to use. Further, the more a business expands, the more complex the data becomes, and managing all the data to drive data-driven business decisions becomes crucial. Microsoft Power BI is the go-to option due to its affordability and extensive features. By leveraging it, you can organize data efficiently, improve access across the organization, and deliver reliable results. Top benefits of Power BI The benefits of Power BI make it an excellent choice for businesses—big, medium, or small- looking for reporting and analytical capabilities beyond Excel. The primary reason is- it offers simple data visualization and analysis across the entire business and obtains in-depth insights into the operation and performance of the business. Here is a rundown of the top unquestionable benefits of Power BI that every kind of business can avail of depending on their requirements. Artificial Intelligence The top features of Microsoft Power BI, according to its list of uses and advantages, may be its ability to access image recognition, and text analytics, build machine learning models, and interface with Azure Machine Learning. The most recent capabilities of Microsoft AI enable anyone, not only data scientists, to prepare data, create machine learning models, and get insights from both organized and unstructured data. Enables Big Data analysis and sharing
Leveraging Power BI with Azure enables it to take on unprecedented volumes of data and speeds up the process of gaining insights. In the process, it also enhances collaboration between business analysts, data engineers, and data scientists. Customized dashboards and interactive reports Among the advantages of the Power BI dashboard is a personalized, intuitive, interactive dashboard that you can further tailor to the business needs rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. A simple drag-and-drop functionality option for creating a customized report also makes it uncomplicated. Thanks to the options for creating robust models and visualizations, the benefits of the Power BI dashboard are virtually endless. Real-time access to information When data is streamed or pushed into the dashboard, it is updated in real-time. This updation of the visualizations with the most recent data and information helps solve problems quickly, spot opportunities, and handle time-sensitive data effectively. Integration of Excel Scores of companies still use Excel for reports and analytics. The benefits of Power BI for firms that still want to use Excel come from its excellent and seamless interaction with Power BI dashboards. This allows for dynamic visualizations with quick access to the appropriate data whenever needed. Exuberant support and integration for multiple data sources  Power BI provides seamless integration with not only Microsoft products but numerous data sources and databases. Some of the popular ones include: Databases like Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle database, IBM, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and many more. Cloud-based data sources include Microsoft Azure SQL Database, Amazon Redshift, and Google BigQuery. Web-based data sources like JSON, XML, and OData feeds Various business applications like Salesforce, Dynamics 365, and SharePoint Online services like Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, and Facebook Hadoop-based sources like HDInsight, Hadoop Distributed File System, and more. In fact, it can connect to any data source for analysis, as it has many built-in connectors. Additionally, you can use custom connectors to connect to sources it doesn’t natively support. Interactive UI/UX features Power BI has easy drag-and-drop capabilities and features to copy all formatting across the visualizations. This makes things aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Ability to customize security features It is feasible to set up row-level-security (RSL) filters that guarantee visitors may only access the pertinent data. This prevents data from being misused, thus mitigating data breach risk. Economical and cost-effective Power BI is significantly less expensive and affordable than other business intelligence and analytics solutions, especially for small and mid-sized enterprises. You can select a suitable Power BI version based on the requirements.  Power BI users can choose between Power BI Desktop, Pro, and Premium versions. Power BI Desktop is a free edition that small businesses can leverage on desktops and create reports and dashboards. On the other hand, the cost of BI Pro is only USD 9.99 per user per month, making it a good choice for SMEs. In addition, the price of Power BI Premium is determined by the deployment size and the number of users. Updates are monthly and packed with new features  Microsoft provides Power BI users with frequent monthly upgrades and a community platform where they may make suggestions. It pays attention to user requests and adds the features that users actively request. This entails ensuring users have access to the newest and most sophisticated features supporting informed business decisions. Multi-Dashboard deployment using Power BI Apps Businesses frequently require several Power BI dashboards and reports. The Power BI Apps allow Power BI Pro customers to swiftly deploy a set of robust, custom-built dashboards and reports and distribute them to the entire organization or particular teams or departments. User-friendly: No specialized tech support is necessary
Being a self-service BI platform, Power BI does not require technical or IT personnel to run, analyze, or create reports. Moreover, its natural language interface, appealing graphic design tools, and simple drag-and-drop tools make designing dashboards easy and comprehensible. All these factors make Power BI incredibly user-friendly and accessible to everyone, with or without tech knowledge. Seamless access to your data, anywhere, on any device, at any time An internet connection is all that Power BI needs for the user to access it. Regardless of the place of work (at work/at home/while traveling/in a meeting), device, or time, anyone can access Power BI in the team through iOS, Android, and Windows devices. Successful collaboration Power BI has a fantastic team collaboration feature. It enables co-ownership of reports and dashboards and readily shares them within its workplaces.

Data Visualization is very crucial for human management in business systems. The computer programs are written in coding language whereas business people need to be able to visualize and understand the business data. Microsoft Power BI provides such tools that will let you visualize key data points accurately from various sources in a single dashboard. Power BI integration with Cortana can visualize data, interact with it in your OS, and search your data with Cortana’s powerful AI systems.
2. Server-level Data Management
In businesses, data comes from various sources. Most of those sources reach the server at some point. Power BI tools let you manage all the business-related data at the server level with the goal that you have more extensive and complete information systems than the data you collected from a program working on a few PCs. 3. Analytics with Internal Software Systems
Your business needs to access data from the complete software system to manage it. Power BI merges with any software platform used to manage the businesses. This consists of mail management, social media platforms, accounting software, CRMs, and traditional data platforms like Azure and MySQL. Multiple dashboards for data management are integrated to form Integrated data management. If the businesses use integrated data management then the businesses need not use multiple dashboards for managing the data. 4. Provide Complex Data Within Software and Apps
Power BI takes input from various sources and provides that data in various contexts, including embedded within your own apps through API by Microsoft. Moreover, Power BI offers tools to manage businesses allowing app customization. It also provides a product value-add feature that is used to track and identify the key data sets regarding the product or service. 5. Streamline Organizational Processes The departments such as Sales, marketing, operations, HR, and so on in the organizations need their own data sets, KPIs, and their own data management systems. Power BI offers specific functionality to the businesses in the form of a data management system/app to streamline the processes from different departments. It let the businesses use the templates for intuitive dashboards and reporting systems instead of creating a system part-wise for your business. It gives your teams the capability to manage quality and efficiency without software customization. 6. Visualize Details Easily
Power BI helps businesses to check any kind of details to ensure that the business is running smoothly. While some enterprises track a small amount of inventory, some businesses track sales calls (made by the sales team members). These data sets are designed with Power BI algorithm and delivered in a readable and easily understandable format.
7. Enhance the Marketing
Businesses spend intensely on online marketing to attract customers. But the huge mass is failing to convert while researching the solutions to their uniques problems online. In this case, Power BI helps you create a chart to track the user behavior all through their online visit. 8. Real-Time Look at the Company’s Financial Performance
Financial issues have an enduring effect on your organization, particularly if it's totally all of a sudden. Microsoft Power BI gives you understanding into the performance of the organizations at numerous levels. With Power BI, you can gaze into teams productivity, top-selling products, the income created by a specific division and numerous different perspectives. With Power BI, you will be able to get immediate attention on sudden financial drops and will be able to fix the issues before it turns into a huge concern. 9. Create Consistent Reporting Standards
Every organization relies on applications from accounting to sales for their day-to-day job duties. You will not always get a reporting feature in these programs and if you get, the format varies from app to app. Using Power BI, you can pull the data and generate reports to provide you organizational standards. It is less hectic for the managers and takes less time to get the data if it is presented in the same format and style each time.
Use-cases of Power BI
There is no doubt that Big Data has big potential today. Most of the companies using Power BI have started enjoying the real benefits such as higher efficiency, improved performance, and more efficient use of their data.

What is Power BI?
Microsoft Power Platform’s business intelligence component, Power BI, enables end-users to visualize data from their connected systems. Moreover, the fact that the desktop version of the program is free means even small firms on a low budget can gain an advantage from the data visualization. Power BI service is a cloud service hosted by Microsoft that is secure and allows users to see dashboards, reports, and Power BI apps using a web browser or through mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android. Additionally, you will see three different software versions on the Power BI pricing page- Power BI Free or Desktop, Power BI Pro, and Power BI Premium. Top 4 Power BI use cases for an enterprise As a business leader, you may wonder how one can use Power BI easily or design dashboards and reports that are eye-catching and comprehensible so that they can support making wise, data-driven business decisions. Let us look at a few use cases where enterprise Power BI dashboards and reports can alter how we look at data. 1. Management of resources
2. Finance Reporting
3. Sales
4. Claims, billing, and collection report Resource Management Let us take the instance of a manufacturing business. The enterprise has multiple manufacturing sites and production facilities in different geographical regions. In such a scenario, a customized dashboard is the best way to manage resource allocation and make improved decisions. Here, the visualization abilities of Power BI are powerful. They can generate the report using Power Query and Power Pivot in Excel. However, for an effective and thorough picture of demand and allocation of resources, Power BI can monitor the following critical KPIs: 1. The number of active projects and resources allotted. 2. Task-counting resources 3. The characteristics and skills of resources 4. The percentage of project completion. Finance reporting dashboards Whichever industry you are in, your enterprise’s main KPI will likely be producing revenue and profit. Keeping track of expenses through long-term Excel spreadsheets or logbooks can get tedious and overwhelming. As you manually update the numbers in the cells, you inevitably begin to lose track. So, enterprises in the modern day have shifted to the potent data visualization program known as Power BI. Let us demonstrate with an example. For an enterprise selling a particular category of devices, creating a PoC or Proof of Concept for its financial reporting dashboard is an excellent way to simplify. Because of a single dashboard, the company’s intricate financial spreadsheets are easy to understand. Since it gives a bird’s-eye perspective of their revenue statements, the enterprise can make swift judgments based on the information about cash flow and product-specific sales summaries. Sales scorecard Which is the simplest way of keeping tabs on the health of the business? It is through the Sales Scorecard. The scorecard or dashboard gives the sales staff a high-level view of what happened with the business the day before and how things are doing overall. Managers can compare the performance of their sales teams by zone and check the entire scorecard of their team. Users can review the reports in-depth by examining the scorecard for each team member, product performance, or even geographic or temporal sales. Nearly all business types need to use sales and marketing scorecards, and we realize that tailoring them to your needs is as crucial to producing the results you need. At any moment, you can do further customization as well as have access to Power BI dashboards. Billing, claims, and collection report The foundation of excellent customer management is quick and efficient claim handling. Any industry that processes claims can benefit from using Power BI to enhance the claims management process—the analytics assist in identifying claim trends and loss patterns while lowering the likelihood of fraud and inefficiency. The claims handlers’ team can optimize the claims and billing process by accelerating the entire process, reducing losses, and raising client satisfaction. Besides this, claim cancellation and collection delay are two significant challenges that must be resolved right away in order to satisfy clients and provide the necessary efficiency to the process.

finance,"What is Power BI?
Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data might be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.
The parts of Power BI
Power BI consists of several elements that all work together, starting with these three basics:
A Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop.
An online software as a service (SaaS) service called the Power BI service.
Power BI Mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.
Screenshot of Diagram of Power BI Desktop, Service, and Mobile showing their integration.
These three elements—Power BI Desktop, the service, and the mobile apps—are designed to let you create, share, and consume business insights in the way that serves you and your role most effectively.
Beyond those three, Power BI also features two other elements:
Power BI Report Builder, for creating paginated reports to share in the Power BI service. Read more about paginated reports later in this article.
Power BI Report Server, an on-premises report server where you can publish your Power BI reports, after creating them in Power BI Desktop. Read more about Power BI Report Server later in this article.
How Power BI matches your role
How you use Power BI depends on your role in a project or on a team. Other people, in other roles, might use Power BI differently.
For example, you might primarily use the Power BI service to view reports and dashboards. Your number-crunching, business-report-creating coworker might make extensive use of Power BI Desktop or Power BI Report Builder to create reports, then publish those reports to the Power BI service, where you view them. Another coworker, in sales, might mainly use the Power BI Mobile app to monitor progress on sales quotas, and to drill into new sales lead details.
If you're a developer, you might use Power BI APIs to push data into semantic models or to embed dashboards and reports into your own custom applications. Have an idea for a new visual? Build it yourself and share it with others.
You also might use each element of Power BI at different times, depending on what you're trying to achieve or your role for a given project.
How you use Power BI can be based on which feature or service of Power BI is the best tool for your situation. For example, you can use Power BI Desktop to create reports for your own team about customer engagement statistics and you can view inventory and manufacturing progress in a real-time dashboard in the Power BI service. You can create a paginated report of mailable invoices, based on a Power BI semantic model. Each part of Power BI is available to you, which is why it's so flexible and compelling.

The flow of work in Power BI
One common workflow in Power BI begins by connecting to data sources in Power BI Desktop and building a report. You then publish that report from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI service, and share it so business users in the Power BI service and on mobile devices can view and interact with the report.
This workflow is common, and shows how the three main Power BI elements complement one another.
Use the deployment pipeline tool
In the Power BI service, you can use the deployment pipeline tool to test your content before you release it to your users. The deployment pipeline tool can help you deploy reports, dashboards, semantic models, and paginated reports. Read about how to get started with deployment pipelines in the Power BI service.
How Microsoft Fabric works with Power BI
Microsoft Fabric is an offering that combines data + services in a unified environment, making it easier to perform analysis and analytics on various sets of data. Power BI is an example of one of the services that's integrated with Microsoft Fabric, and your organization's OneLake data store is an example of the data that can be used, analyzed, or visualized. Large organizations find Microsoft Fabric particularly useful, since it can corral and then bring greater value to large stores of data, then using services (like Power BI) to bring such data to business life.
Administration of Power BI is now handled by Microsoft Fabric, but your favorite tools like the Power BI service and Power BI Desktop still operate like they always have - as a service that can turn your data, whether in OneLake or in Excel, into powerful business intelligence insights.
Paginated reports in the Power BI service
Another workflow involves paginated reports in the Power BI service. Enterprise report creators design paginated reports to be printed or shared. They can also share these reports in the Power BI service. They're called paginated because they're formatted to fit well on a page. They're often used for operational reports, or for printing forms such as invoices or transcripts. They display all the data in a table, even if the table spans multiple pages. Power BI Report Builder is the standalone tool for authoring paginated reports.

finance,"7 reasons to use Microsoft Power BI Microsoft Power BI is a suite of business intelligence (BI), reporting, and data visualization products and services for individuals and teams. Power BI stands out with streamlined publication and distribution capabilities, as well as integration with other Microsoft products and services. But is it a good choice for your organization? What is Microsoft Power BI? ""Power BI,"" Microsoft says, ""is a business analytics solution that lets you visualize your data and share insights across your organization, or embed them in your app or website."" The solution comprises several products and services, and value and versatility comes from leveraging the individual elements, and taking advantage of how they work together. Power BI service Power BI service is a secure Microsoft hosted cloud service that lets users view dashboards, reports, and Power BI apps — a type of content that combines related dashboards and reports — using a web browser or via mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android. Power BI Desktop Power BI Desktop is a free, self-service data analysis and report authoring tool that you install on a Windows computer. It can connect to more than 70 on-premises and cloud data sources to turn information into interactive visuals. Data scientists and developers work with Power BI Desktop to produce reports and make them available to the Power BI service. Power BI Desktop In Power BI Desktop, users can: Connect to data Transform and model the data Create charts and graphs Create reports and dashboards that are collections of visuals Share reports with others using the Power BI service Find the fastest path to business insights Sign up for free → Contact Sales → Power BI Pro Power BI Pro is cloud-based software that comes with a monthly fee of $10 per user. The biggest difference between Power BI Desktop and Power BI Pro is the ability to collaborate with other Power BI users and distribute reports and visualizations to other Power BI subscribers across the organization (see chart below). With Power BI Pro, users can: Embed Power BI visuals into Power BI apps Integrate with other Microsoft solutions, such as Azure data services Share data, dashboards, and reports with other Power BI users Create workspaces — places to collaborate with colleagues to create collections of dashboards and reports Enable peer-to-peer sharing — a way to share published dashboards or reports with people outside the organization who have a Power BI Pro license A table from Microsoft Power BI docs provides a feature comparison between the Desktop and Pro versions of Power BI: Product comparison table Power BI Premium Unlike Power BI Desktop and Pro, Power BI Premium is not an application. Premium gives an organization space and capacity in a Microsoft-hosted cloud to share reports. An organization can choose how to apply its dedicated capacity by allocating it based on the number of users, workload needs, or other factors — and scale up or down as needed. With Power BI Premium users have: Flexibility to publish reports across an enterprise, without requiring recipients to be licensed individually per user Greater scale and performance than shared capacity in the Power BI service The ability to maintain BI assets on-premises with Power BI Report Server One API surface, a consistent set of capabilities, and access to the latest features for embedded analytics Pro and Premium considerations If your organization has many people who create reports and visualizations, and who don't share information often, a Pro subscription may be sufficient. However, if you must share the information both inside and outside of your organization, you'll need a Premium subscription. Power BI Premium is priced based on the number of virtual cores Microsoft dedicates to the service. You can see prices at the Power BI pricing page.

You can create reports in Power BI Desktop or Pro, and viewers can use Report Server to access those reports on a web browser or mobile device, or they can receive them as an email. Report Server would be useful for a company that has restrictions on cloud usage. Power BI Mobile Power BI has mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows 10 mobile devices that let users connect to and interact with data. Power BI Embedded Power BI Embedded allows developers to embed Power BI dashboards and reports into other applications, either within their own organization — which requires users to sign in to a Power BI account — or in an application for a client or customers who don't have a Power BI account. 7 reasons to use Power BI How do you know whether Microsoft Power BI is right for your organization? Here are seven reasons to choose Power BI — and one reason you may want to choose something else: A quick start. You'll be able to get insights quickly with an uncomplicated setup, no required training, and included dashboards for services such as Salesforce, Google Analytics, and Microsoft Dynamics. Streamlined publication and distribution. Instead of emailing large files or putting them on a shared drive, analysts upload reports and visualizations to the Power BI service, and their data is refreshed whenever the underlying dataset is updated. Real-time information. Dashboards update in real time, as data is pushed or streamed in, which gives viewers the ability to solve problems and identify opportunities quickly. Any report or dashboard can display and update real-time data and visuals. Sources of streaming data can be factory sensors, social media sources, or anything from which time-sensitive data can be collected or transmitted. Ability to customize Power BI app navigation. An ""app navigation experiences"" feature gives report developers the power to customize navigation to help viewers find content quickly and understand the relationships between different reports and dashboards. Ability to customize security features. Report developers can set up row-level security (RLS) access filters to ensure that viewers see only data relevant to them, mitigating the risk of people seeing data they shouldn’t. Cortana integration. Power BI works with Microsoft's digital assistant, Cortana. Users can verbally ask questions in natural language to access charts and graphs. This can be especially helpful for users with mobile devices. Artificial Intelligence. Power BI users can access image recognition and text analytics, create machine learning models, and integrate with Azure Machine Learning. So, why would you want to pass on Power BI? Well, the online Power BI service — including Pro and Premium — is accessible from any web browser, but the Power BI Desktop application is not available for Linux or Mac operating systems. If you're in a Mac-only environment, Microsoft Power BI Desktop may not be right for you. Stitch helps get your data to Power BI Before you analyze your data with Power BI, you'll need to replicate data from all of your sources into a data warehouse.

finance,"What is Power BI? - Beginner's Guide to Power BI Learn about the origins and development of this revolutionary business intelligence tool. Discover why industries across the globe rely on Power BI to visualize their data and inform their decision-making. In 2021, the global datasphere held around 80 zettabytes of data. If trends continue as they are, by 2025, that number will nearly double. In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the ability to harness and interpret this vast amount of data is not just a competitive advantage—it's a necessity. Businesses and organizations are increasingly relying on data visualization and business intelligence tools to make sense of complex datasets, transforming raw numbers into actionable insights. Power BI, Microsoft’s premier business intelligence and visualization tool, stands at the forefront of this revolution. This cloud-based suite of apps, software, and connectors not only aggregates and contextualizes raw business data but also converts it into interactive visual dashboards. With more than 250,000 organizations, including 97 percent of Fortune 500 companies, depending on Power BI, it's evident that this tool is playing an instrumental role in how we understand and utilize data. A Brief History of Power BI Power BI began like many great inventions do, as a top-secret project with a cool code name! It started in 2006 as the brainchild of Thierry D’hers and Amir Netz from Microsoft’s SQL Server Reporting Services Team. At the time, it was a classified project with the code name “Gemini.” Project Gemini harnessed the power of Microsoft’s SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) and transformed it into an in-memory storage engine. Gemini debuted in 2009 under the name “PowerPivot,” which was a free Excel extension. However, it remained more or less undiscovered by the data science community until Microsoft PowerPivot expert Rob Collie blogged about it to Excel users. Then, the company added Data Explorer (later renamed “Power Query”) to its menu of Excel add-ins. Unfortunately, even though PowerPivot and Power Query were widely accessible and wildly popular, emailing massive Excel files proved to be a problem. In addition, there was no way to schedule data refreshes. In 2015, Microsoft paired the two add-ins and renamed the business intelligence tool “Power BI.” Even before the application hit the virtual shelves, it garnered enough excitement that over 500,000 unique users signed on to test and help design the revolutionary new product. Then, just months later, Power BI went public. The rest, they say, is history. But it’s also the future. The project went on to win multiple People’s Choice awards and 2018’s PUG Data Visualization Shootout award. Eventually, the overwhelming majority of business leaders wouldn’t dream of making strategic decisions without the insights provided by Power BI. What is Power BI? At its highest level, Power BI enables organizations to pull raw data from numerous cloud-based (SaaS) systems and transform it into actionable data using a powerful, interactive, and easy-to-use user interface (UI). In addition, the platform isolates what’s essential to provide invaluable insights into the metrics individual users need. Top Features Power BI is feature-rich and agile, making it one of the best BI tools on the market. Its most popular features include: Direct connectivity to Excel and easily integrates with other Microsoft products Ability to compress data and extract insight from large datasets – up to 100 million rows as opposed to just over 1 million for Excel. Customizability using R and Python Enabling users to build interactive maps Using Power Query to import, filter and translate data Availability of the mobile app in all versions Enabling users to re-use datasets across multiple platforms and reports (Pro and Premium versions) An adaptive and friendly user experience. Through its active and dynamic online community, Microsoft listens to user input and adapts Power BI accordingly with monthly updates. Power BI also gets its data from OneLake, allowing you to connect to your data stored in OneLake to Power BI. Why Power BI is Different Business leaders have multiple business intelligence tools to choose from, so why do 97 percent of them use Power BI? Of course, Power BI provides reports. In fact, with just a few clicks, any user can generate dynamic reports. But, it also features data discovery, data transformation, and perhaps most importantly, data modeling. The simple UI lets users create and visualize reports via a centralized mobile or desktop dashboard and, because Power BI is SaaS, there are no hardware costs or ongoing upgrade costs. Power BI is scalable and portable and its upgrades are automatic. Finally, for businesses looking to integrate machine learning tools into their workplace, it gives users access to a catalog of pre-trained but customizable machine learning models. These machine learning algorithms produce real-time results and actionable insights. Power BI vs Excel As we know, Power BI's roots were as an Excel add-in, but today it stands on its own. Those who are uninitiated to Power BI might wonder why Microsoft offers two seemingly competitive data analysis applications. Still, when you dig a little deeper, it’s clear that the two applications are very different. Below is a comparison of strengths and weaknesses: Excel Strengths Fast calculations. You can’t beat Excel’s speed and ease in making calculations, operations, and creating formulas. Multiple uses. Excel is not just a data science application. Organizations use Excel in accounting, human resources, operations management, and of course, business analysis. Excel tasks include data entry and scraping data from a website without switching apps. Wide variety of templates. While the application is fully customizable, there are several included templates, many of which require no previous Excel training. Great for creating tabular reports. Excel provides a structured way to present data in rows and columns, making it ideal for generating detailed reports. Advanced calculation tables. Excel allows users to create complex personalized calculation tables. Excel Weaknesses Collaboration is awkward. To collaborate in Excel, a file needs to be saved in the cloud or manually shared. Data limits. Excel is limited to 1 million rows of data. Power BI Strengths Assortment of visualizations. Power BI’s visualizations are interactive, intuitive, and gorgeous! It features drop-and-drag functionality, letting even relatively new users modify the looks of a report. Users can also apply filters and interact directly with the app. Administrators can purchase and download custom visuals from Microsoft Marketplace. Options include maps, charts, graphs, KPIs, R script visuals, etc. Powerful collaboration. Power BI lets users collaborate in real-time, and with Power BI Service, multiple people can work on the same file at the same time. Connectivity. Power BI connects to multiple data sources, including Excel, SQL Server databases, Google Analytics, social media analytics, Azure sources, cloud-based sources, etc. Power BI can also access multiple Big Data sources. Excel integration. Users can upload and view Power BI data in Excel; this is especially beneficial when using tabular reports. Unprecedented connectivity. Power BI is cloud-based and can access and extract data from nearly any system or application. Seamless on-premises data integration. With Personal Gateway, users can keep their reports and dashboards up-to-date with the latest data from on-premises sources without moving the data to the cloud. Robust data capacity. Power BI can handle 100 million rows of data. Intelligent, automatic updates. Power BI updates automatically after taking real user experiences into account. Integration into apps and websites. Power BI Embedded lets developers embed or add Power BI reports to apps and websites. Ideal for reporting. Because of Power BI's strength in visualizations and data integration, it is idea for key performance indicators and dashboards Power BI Weaknesses Not designed for complex tables. Power BI has trouble handling multiple links between tables. Users need to ensure that additional data models have unique fields, or Power BI could end up confusing the tables. Bulky UI. Power BI’s user interface appears busy with icons and options, sometimes blocking the view of dashboards and reports. Difficult to configure visuals. Microsoft includes a wide variety of visuals with Power BI. However, while users rarely need to configure visuals, customization options are limited. Power BI’s DAX formula is sometimes called rigid. Power BI is built around DAX as an expression language. DAX can be challenging. Concatenating more than two elements requires nesting statements. Complex. On its own, Power BI is an intuitive, relatively simple tool to import data and create reports. However, multiple interrelated tools add to its complexity. Closed-source. As with all Microsoft Office suite products, Power BI is closed-source. While both Power BI and Excel are databases, they are designed for integration. Most organizations use Excel for tabular reports with limited data requirements, and Power BI for data analysis and visualizations. Of course, there are other BI tools out there, Tableau being the main one. Check out our Power BI vs Tableau guide for a comparison of both for your data science and analytics needs. What Are the Three Types of Power BI Licenses? Power BI offers a desktop version along with Pro and Premium versions.

Learn why FP&A teams rely on our real-time financial and operational data access for faster and more strategic planning, reporting, and analysis. I really enjoyed working with the support team at Cube. The implementation process was very efficient. In two weeks our company was up and running with Cube thanks to the support team. Once starting to use the product most of the features are intuitive and easy to learn. Areas that were pain points the support team worked as hard as they could to provide us with a solution. Cube is working to continue to iterate their product and provide new features. Cube also listens to their customers for feedback which is great as a power user. Their engineering and design teams have listened to my feedback on multiple occasions as they work to consistently improve the product. The least helpful areas of Cube are based on specifics with the ability to build models within excel. A few features (such as updating and fetching ranges) have to be done each time an adjustment is made to a model. I do feel like within excel updates happen while the model is being built (or by just fetching new data, without having to re-build the range, etc). I will say our company is more focused on detailed modeling using all Cube functions than a traditional FP&A team, and Cube support understands these frustrations and have it in their queue to resolve which is exciting. Our team has been using Cube for a little over two years and it was a sorely needed replacement to for Oracle PBCS. Since then, our company has gone through significant change, building new revenue streams & reorganizing. Cube provided us with the flexibility and usability that we needed to navigate change. We love the easy-to-use Dimension Manager and calculated fields. One of our favorite things, is it's compatibility with Google Sheets. Our organization is primarily on GSuite, so this helped move our team away from excel based reporting and into GSheets which was compatible with the org. Overall this has been a very positive transition for the team. Our favorite feature is also our biggest frustration. The Google Sheet add-in in extremely slow and occassionally times out with large queries. If you make a duplicate of a file, you will need to reselect your range to pull a query. It is slow and frustrating, but we are happy to have the connectivity. No simultaneous loading (ie. two teammates cannot load at the same time). At this time, Cube is not an ideal prodcut for larger teams. It's works for a team of 3 but we occassionally run into issues when teammembers have to delay their loads while we wait for another to complete. I'm sure that this issue would only compound with added teammembers. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. Cube integrates seemlessly with Google Sheets which has made budgeting on both a product and account level much easier and much more collaborative because it doesn't require logging in to a different system and subsequent training. It has also significantly reduced the amount of time it takes to produce the financials which has allowed for futher development of new reporting templates. We also see so much value in connecting other data sources to Cube beyond on our financial data. The opportunities to replace more manual reporting processes are endless. I would like for there to be an easy way to view and fetch data into all Cube linked spreadsheets without having to login to each one individually, but this by no means should be a deterrent from using Cube. It is an excellent tool. Through the use of Cube, we have automated a significant number of manual processes. Data is accumulated, analyzed and reviewed more effectively, which saves the Finance team time and allows the sharing of information to business partners. When we've provided product feedback, the team has been quick to add it to the solution roadmap and address. I appreciate how Cube takes customer feedback and is continuously innovating on their product.I think the tool could have had a stronger day 1 integration with our accounting ERP. Although the day 1 look and feel left room for improvement, the Cube team addressed concerns and updated the product functionality. - Cube will facilitate the process of extracting the data on an excel sheet or google sheet with less effort with a particular preference - It is a good tool to build a financial model for frequent reporting of the financials by only one click - The customization of the dimensions (Tags) to extract a set of data in a single line - More improvement in the acceleration of extracting the data needs to be consider constantly with a growing volume of data - More automation tools to be implemented for planning process support - Enhancing the visualization of the data ( It's already there but needs some improvement in the customization process) Lots to choose from but one of the huge draws is that it acts as an extension of programs you're already familiar with, Excel and Sheets. There's no programming language to learn, no complicated portals to work within. If you don't know BI, you don't need to learn it. You can ""Cube-ify"" your existing spreadsheets, or build from the ground up. The functionality is similar to the way pivot tables work, so it's intuitive to learn and use. & of course it's powerful. QBO doesn't have a robust or flexible budget capability, and filling that gap is what led me to Cube. I'm able to fully house budget and forecast scenarios, run reports and analytics, all within Cube. It's easy to shift a couple parameters, hit update, and refesh your report in the same place to run different scenarios. I tend to use it more frequently than the accounting software's built in reports, and now I've extended its capabilities beyond just budgets and into revenue and payroll. Huge shout out to the support team as well. I always have a dedicated rep at hand for help (what's up Riley!); the support articles are genuinely useful, which is refreshing for finance software; & they're always looking for product feedback to help adapt the roadmap to what's actually needed. The only flaw that I find is something they've communicated that they're constantly working to improve, which is speed to load or fetch data. It can be time consuming to update and process a bunch of different reports. However, some important caveats: some of the lag is due to the way our company structure is set up; I have been able to re-design/architect my reports/sheets with speed in mind & to make things more efficient, and that's gone a long way; Cube has already improved the speed of fetching noticeably since I first got setup. I expect it will only continue to improve until it's no longer even noticeable.",Cube
finance,"Introduction Cube Software is a spreadsheet-native cloud based FP&A platform that improves companies budgeting and forecasting automation and accuracy. While Cube Software is a great option for many companies and can greatly improve its financial processes, choosing an FP&A software that starts at $20k+ a year is a big decision. This article will break down Cube’s pros and cons and highlight some important customer reviews to help you make the most informed decision. Who is Cube Software for? Cube was made for, and focuses on, small businesses. While companies such as Workday Adaptive Planning (large, enterprise corporations), and Datarails (small and medium sized scalable businesses) cater to certain customer bases, Cube’s platform focuses exclusively on small businesses and startups. Highlights of Cube’s functions: Multi-scenario analysis Seamlessly model how changes to key assumptions affect overall outputs. Spreadsheet integrations Cube is compatible and bi-directional with any spreadsheet, including Excel and Google Sheets. Centralized formulas and KPIs Store all of your calculations in a central location and manage from a single source of truth. Multi-currency support Evaluate your financials in local and reporting currencies. Automated data consolidation Connect data from multiple sources for automated rollups and drilldowns. Cube has some great functions and does a good job of consolidating and upgrading finance teams’ processes. Their growing customer base numbering around 300 organizations attests to that. But let’s take a look at some customer reviews: Cube FP&A Reviews After analyzing dozens of independent reviews from Cube customers there are a few positive things that stand out: Single source of truth-Perhaps the number one reason why any organization wants to implement FP&A technology is having all company information easily accessible. A single source of truth avoids multiple spreadsheet updates and mistakes that Excel and Google Sheets are famous for. Automation- Another top reason for companies to use FP&A software is to automate all of the manual inputs that used to take up so much time. Whereas without FP&A software, finance teams used to spend up to 75% of their time on manual work, now customers are able to free up many hours. They can use that time to analyze and conduct other more productive tasks. Frequent upgrades-Cube is a young company and glitches are fixed through product feature updates and ready customer support. Reviewers point to benefits such as frequent product updates and listening closely to customer feedback. Cube Limitations However, Cube does have a number of limitations that buyers need to be aware of. Recent customer reviews on sites, such as G2 and Capterra, mention the following drawbacks of using Cube. Difficulties in uploading models -Customers experience consistent difficulties in uploading and arranging their operating model which are then coded and uploaded to Cube. One small company complained that they have to set aside “30 minutes to an hour” to run “imports from our accounting software Intacct to bring in actuals each month.” Limited drilldown – Another big challenge for sophisticated finance teams: Cube does not have drilldown capabilities (the ability to click on a certain statistic and see more detailed descriptions. For example, sales by geographic location or revenue broken down by time periods). Messy transfer of data- Cube has a “dimensional structure” giving users 4 predefined custom dimensions (for instance “finance Cube” and “HR cube). To transfer data between these “dimensions” is relatively complex. Users first have to publish it onto Excel and save the other Cube in Excel. Therefore for many users the process is not considered stable or secure. Limited dimensions – Companies that require granular or detailed level in reports find that Cube’s limited number of dimensions makes it difficult to do reporting flexibly or keep existing models used by companies pre-Cube. In fact, after analyzing over 7,000 calls with potential customers, we found that limited data dimensions was the main reason (cited 54% of the time) for companies choosing Datarails over Cube. For instance, one nonprofit complained that Cube does not allow them to report on a “number of different areas” and “having more dimensions available to us could make things easier”. In this way, Cube is one of the least flexible solutions. No AI capabilities – Unlike many FP&A vendors, Cube does not have AI capabilities. In contrast, next gen FP&A software uses simulation, optimization and ML-based statistical modeling that links corporate strategy to execution. Companies quickly grow out of Cube – For companies that are growing or scaling fast Cube is less optimal, though smaller companies report that Cube satisfies their needs. But when companies hit a certain size, Cube is unlikely to be able to meet their reporting requirements. Cube Pricing Cube has some very attractive pricing points, specifically for small businesses and startups in the “Essentials” plan. With a starting price of $1,250 a month, it is very difficult to find another solution that comes close to that price range. However, there are additional fees and limited features to keep in mind, especially with the “Essentials” plan: Although it’s priced per month Cube puts customers on yearly contracts with no free trial period (in contrast to other leading vendors that provide a free two week or month trial). This means that when choosing Cube, buyers must be absolutely certain that it is a smart choice or face being locked in for an entire year. Consulting is an additional fee of $250 per month (up to 4 hours/ month) – which again can quickly add up. The “Essentials” plan only comes with Quickbooks and Xero integrations. One time implementation fee for all plans which usually runs around $5- $10K depending on the size of the company and complications of the implementation. cube pricing plan Cube Alternatives 1. Datarails Datarails and Cube are often compared as they are two of the best FP&A solutions that cater specifically to SMBs and startups. Datarails is a financial planning and analysis platform that automates data consolidation, reporting and planning, while enabling finance teams to continue using their own Excel spreadsheets and financial models. Datarails highlights: Easy implementation –1-2 weeks for first output. 6-12 weeks for full implementation. Unlike all other vendors, Datarails takes on the entire implementation until the customer is satisfied. Superior customer service – for your entire time with Datarails customers get dedicated FP&A experts and regular catch-ups. In the words of one reviewer, “Datarails provides exceptional customer service before, during and after implementation. They were with us every step of customization and building reports and dashboards. The tool provided accessibility and timeliness of information to the business leaders and business analysts.” The only native Excel solution – Datarails is the only truly native Excel solution, so users who know Excel can perform just about anything in Datarails. Full, granular drilldown-In contrast to Cube, Datarails offers “full drilldowns in seconds” according to customers. Integrates with any source system -Datarails Integrates with any source system including CRM, ERP, and HRIS. Powerful workflows –Workflows allow for better collaboration and audit control along with automatic source data updates. Complete flexibility – Datarails supports unlimited dimensions. and allows you to keep any existing models or choose pre-defined ones. Integration across your business to provide a complete source of truth – Over 70 available software integrations- sales, marketing, HR, accounting. This helps transform business and move from “multiple versions of truth” to “one version of truth.” AI /ML – Datarails is an AI-enabled FP&A leader, providing integrating machine learning tools to provide added powerful insights. Development includes analyzing excel files for automatic comprehension and automatic generation of useful dashboards and drill down abilities for navigating complex formulas. DataRails processes tens of thousands Excel reports every month. This enables us to improve the insight, the structuring and the modeling of the data by AI and ML algorithms. Datarails Cons: Datarails doesn’t have full compatibility with Google Sheets and Mac although this will be live by the end of 2022. For small startups, other solutions such as Cube have a cheaper “Essentials” plan. Customer base is almost exclusively in the US, Canada, and the UK",Cube

finance,"PROS : Intuitive - it acts as an extension of programs you're already familiar with, Excel and Sheets. There's no programming language to learn, no complicated portals to work within. If you don't know BI, you don't need to learn it. You can ""Cube-ify"" your existing spreadsheets, or build from the ground up. The functionality is similar to the way pivot tables work, so it's intuitive to learn and use. Powerful - It wrangles all our different streams of data from different places and you're able to control it with a few clicks from an Excel sidebar A huge shout out to the support team as well. I always have a dedicated rep at hand for help (what's up Riley!); the support articles are genuinely useful, which is refreshing for finance software; & they're always looking for product feedback to help adapt the roadmap to what's actually needed. Data implementation P&L Reporting Easy of use Automates recurring financial reporting Highly customizable Multiuse for reporting, planning, budgeting, analysis It quickly aggregates and slices data in the format we need. Even when that data is too large for excel or other tools. It has flexible hierarchies so that we can make a variety of reports using similar information. The support team is always quick help and resolve issues. Cube uploads data from set connection on a schedule you set allowing you to always up to date information. Provides flexibility with respect to how the reports / templates are organized It is easy to create and adjust the dimension hierarchy for accounts We can connect to multiple data sources",Cube

Read more Simple and Powerful If you're forecasting and tracking KPIs in spreadsheets and its time to upgrade to a formal product, but you're hesitant to pull the trigger on a host of tools that require lengthy implementation cycles, limit your end users, or isn't flexible to encompass your business operations, you need to schedule a demo with Cube. It will help organize your existing chaos and scale as you continue to grow Painless and Fun Implementation & Usage We mainly use Cube as a way to store our budget (and consistent budget updates) and to do our reporting. We were housing our budget on a google sheet before and there were always formula breaks, manual errors, no audit trail, etc. With the implementation of Cube, we are able to have one source of truth and sleep easier knowing that our budget is stored correctly. I love that we can store each budget update as a different scenario as well and therefore be able to see how it has changed throughout the year. We were also manually updating reports each month with our budget from google sheets and actuals from Intacct. Now having everything all together in Cube has cut down on report building by days!! We hope to soon start importing our international entities financials as well to be able to see the full scope of our organization all in one place. PROS One of my favorite parts of Cube was how quick and easy the implementation process was. We were up and running in less than a month after signing the contract and the team communicated with us the whole team. The training was super simple and our account manager is almost always available instantly to help us with whatever we need. I can actually sleep better at night knowing that all my information is correct and accurate and stored somewhere other than google drive. It has also helped me cut down immensely on the time to create a monthly report book. CONS I would say the only downsides are that there is a limited number of dimensions your organization can have. As a nonprofit, we report on a lot of different areas and having more dimensions available to us could make things easier. On top of that, we show things at a very granular, detailed level in reports and having more dimensions would allow us to showcase these details more easily. It also can be a bit slow to run the imports from our accounting software Intacct to bring in actuals each month so I have to make sure I plan in advance to give 30 mins to an hour for the details to come through. REASON FOR CHOOSING CUBE price, implementation timeline, ease of use and flexibility, ongoing support. PROS It's Simple. Cube takes in your KPIs and other data, and connects to your accounting systems. Then, connect to Sheets or Excel, create your output mapping, and now you have a single source of truth you can manipulate without worrying if someone is going to hard code a cell and throw off downstream calculations. Cube will allow you to give your department leaders the ability to create their own scenarios and forecasts, track their budget to actuals, and see their own P&Ls, all within a spreadsheet. CONS Cube is a newer platform, and as such they're doing aggressive feature building. This means that some functionality has been impacted on occasion for a short period of time. Thankfully, their customer service teams are on top of the issues and able to support. Cube x InStride Review Cube has been a critical tool for our finance team to scale with our rapidly growing company. We're able to spend less time on creation of reports and focus more on the analysis and impact drivers to help influence decision across the company. PROS Cube has allowed my team to automate several aspects of our budgeting, forecasting, and monthly financial reviews. We're able to quickly drilldown into the details to see assumptions around our budgets and line item expenses. We have created templates that allow us to upload monthly forecasts in real time as we meet with our department leads. CONS I would love to see some payroll and headcount planning and tracking capabilities in the future. Potentially a link with our payroll system that helps forecast all compensation related costs by employee that we can roll-up into our forecasts REASON FOR CHOOSING CUBE This was my first use of a tool like this and I appreciated the simplicity of how to use the tool and the low price point. Fit in perfectly for our size company. Flexible, Dynamic Planning Tool! Implementation was very easy compared to other planning tools. The Cube team is extremely accessible and helpful throughout the process. The tool is very intuitive, and has helped us a huge step forward as a function. PROS Cube helped us to take a huge step forward in our planning and reporting. It allows the team to continue to work in spreadsheets (both Excel and Google Sheets), while ensuring accuracy of data and providing version control. CONS I don't have any major complaints about the software. There are a few small features we have requested (suppress zeroes, etc). The team has been very responsive to our requests and the tool meets our needs overall. REASON FOR CHOOSING CUBE Cost, speed to implement, flexibility, compatibility with both Excel and Google Sheets",Cube

finance,"Cube Software, a New York-based startup that’s building a next-gen financial planning and analysis (FP&A) platform for modern finance teams, has raised $10 million in a series A round of funding to disrupt what it calls the “decades-old” enterprise performance management (EPM) industry. Founded in 2018, Cube has entered a space occupied by numerous legacy players, including publicly traded Anaplan; Adaptive Insights, which Workday acquired for north of $1.5 billion in 2018; Hyperion, which Oracle bought for more than $3 billion in 2007; and good old-fashioned spreadsheets. Cube is looking to combine the power of a modern software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform with the familiar flexibility of spreadsheets. “Within Finance, FP&A is a mission critical function that relies on spreadsheets alone in 80-90% of companies,” Cube founder and CEO Christina Ross told VentureBeat. “The problem is that spreadsheets are manual and error prone, while legacy FP&A software requires users to learn an entirely new ecosystem outside of spreadsheets to do the same job.” VB Transform 2024 Registration is Open Join enterprise leaders in San Francisco from July 9 to 11 for our flagship AI event.

Register Now Above: Cube’s FP&A platform And so Cube is setting out to make FP&A software more accessible, with the ability to onboard users in days versus months, while connecting directly into existing spreadsheets and other data sources to deliver analytics and insights. In other words, Cube wants to supplement, rather than replace, spreadsheets. “We believe that the spreadsheet is not your enemy,” Ross added. Companies can connect Cube to multiple data sources — using Cube’s API or via prebuilt integrations — to consolidate all their data automatically. They can also model how changes to key assumptions may impact their outputs, create customizable reports based on reusable templates, and integrate with any spreadsheet, including Excel and Google Sheets, with support for bi-directional data sharing.

Limitations and Alternatives
While Cube Software offers robust FP&A capabilities and streamlined processes, it does have limitations around advanced reporting and visualization, scalability, integration, user-friendliness, and predictive analytics. Here, we delve into some primary constraints of Cube and explore alternative competitors to consider.
1. Limited Advanced Reporting and Visualization Features
While Cube excels in streamlining FP&A processes and offering flexible reporting options, users may find its advanced reporting and visualization features somewhat lacking. Compared to more comprehensive business intelligence (BI) tools like Tableau or Power BI, Cube may fall short in providing sophisticated data visualization capabilities and customizable dashboards. Businesses requiring extensive graphical representation of financial data may find these aspects of Cube limiting.
2. Scalability Challenges for Large Enterprises
Although Cube caters well to small and midsize enterprises (SMEs), larger organizations with complex financial structures and massive data volumes may encounter scalability challenges. As the volume and complexity of financial data increase, Cube's performance may start to lag, impacting processing speeds and overall efficiency. For enterprises requiring high scalability and performance, enterprise performance management (EPM) solutions like Oracle Hyperion or SAP BPC might offer more robust capabilities.
3. Limited Integration with Third-Party Systems
While Cube boasts seamless integration with popular accounting systems and data sources, some users may find its compatibility with niche or custom-built systems limited. Businesses relying heavily on specialized software solutions for industry-specific functions may face challenges integrating these systems with Cube. In such cases, considering alternative FP&A solutions with broader integration capabilities, such as Anaplan or Adaptive Insights, might offer more flexibility and interoperability.
4. Learning Curve for Advanced Features
Despite Cube's user-friendly interface and intuitive design, mastering its advanced features may require a learning curve for some users. Businesses with limited resources for training and onboarding may find it challenging to leverage Cube's full potential effectively. Alternatively, FP&A solutions like Vena or Host Analytics offer more user-friendly interfaces and comprehensive training resources, facilitating quicker adoption and proficiency among users.
5. Limited Support for Predictive Analytics
While Cube excels in historical data analysis and forecasting, its support for predictive analytics may be limited compared to specialized predictive modeling tools like IBM Planning Analytics or SAS Visual Analytics. Businesses seeking advanced predictive modeling capabilities, machine learning algorithms, and scenario analysis features may find Cube's offerings in this regard insufficient. In such cases, considering integrated BI and predictive analytics platforms might offer a more comprehensive solution.
Conclusion
Cube Software stands out as a versatile and user-friendly solution for financial planning and analysis (FP&A) tasks, offering a range of benefits such as ease of use, seamless integration with Excel, and robust reporting capabilities. Its ability to streamline budgeting, forecasting, and performance analysis processes has earned it praise from users across various industries.
However, it's essential to acknowledge Cube's limitations, including its relatively less sophisticated reporting and visualization features compared to some competitors, scalability challenges for larger enterprises, and the learning curve associated with mastering advanced features.

You can implement Essbase:
on the cloud, using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure via Marketplace listings
by installing Essbase 21c on independent deployments. For supported platforms, see the Oracle certification matrix.
Platform Features
Architecture — The Essbase 21c independent deployment architecture includes a middle-tier platform that runs on WebLogic. This Fusion Middleware architecture enables fast performance, optimized memory usage, high concurrency, flexible deployment options, and failover.
Essbase on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure architecture utilizes OCI to enable the same benefits. Both independent and cloud-based architectures utilize Oracle Database and/or your choice of relational database to store Essbase schemas.
Query Engine — Hybrid mode is the default query engine for block storage cubes, providing robust dependency analysis and fast aggregation. Hybrid mode has fewer limitations than it did in Release 11g, handles more calculations, and is enhanced with several tuning options.
Failover — In Essbase 11g, Provider Services enabled failover leasing managed through OPMN. Today, on Essbase 21c independent deployments only, failover is integrated with WebLogic to support a central request leasing system that determines which node is active and which nodes are waiting on standby.
Security — In Essbase 21c independent deployments, all data is encrypted in transit layer using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2. You can implement a load balancer. In deployments of Essbase on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, you can implement public or private subnets, policies, firewalls, and other network security options available in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
For user authentication, you can choose WebLogic Embedded LDAP in conjunction with your choice of external authentication provider, or, if you already use EPM Shared Services security, you can continue to use it with Essbase 21c independent deployments only. Authentication using Identity Cloud Service (IDCS) is an option if you are deploying Essbase on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure via Marketplace.
There are three Essbase user roles: User, Power User, and Service Administrator. Application permissions, granted separately, are Application Manager, Database Manager, Database Update, and Database Access. All roles from EPM Shared Services can be mapped to the new roles and permissions, or, you can continue to use EPM Shared Services (Essbase Essbase 21c independent deployments only).
Essbase filters help you implement fine-tuned, cell-level access controls to your cubes. Using dynamic filters with built in functions/variables, you can make filters extensible and adaptible to a changing user base and real-time source data. You can use LoginAs to test the filters in the administrative interface.
Administrative Interface —The Essbase web interface enables you to manage applications, users/groups, and Essbase artifacts. It includes a rich outline editor, scripting editors, a data analysis interface where you can save grid layouts, and a load rules editor with built-in data previews. A centralized Jobs interface lets you initiate requests, and monitor active and recent requests. Cube Designer and Smart View, as well as utilities for migration, automation, and administration, are available to download from the Console.
Essbase Administration Services Lite — Although the Essbase web interface is the modern administration interface and offers the current platform features, a light version of Essbase Administration Services (EAS) is a limited-support option for continued management of your applications, in case your company is not ready to adopt the new interface. The features and functionality of EAS are limited to what was available in Release 11g and do not encompass the modern platform features.
Accelerated Development and Audit Capabilities — Calculation tracing lets you monitor and debug calculation scripts. Query tracing can be used to monitor and debug query performance. Audit trail enables you to track changes made to data. Solve order can be adjusted while you're working in Smart View.
Automation and Developer tools — REST API helps you automate management of hosted Essbase resources and operations over secured HTTP. Java and C API are also available, as well as a new command line interface (CLI), the MaxL administrative scripting language, Report Writer, and backward-compatibility support for the ESSCMD command language.
Catalog — The Catalog is a central place to store files and artifacts associated with Essbase applications and users. It includes user and shared directories, and an instructive Gallery of sample cubes.
Gallery — Included in the Catalog is a Gallery of cube templates, in the form of Excel application workbooks. You can easily import these workbooks to build a diverse variety of sample cubes. The samples are instructional for learning about different use cases for Essbase applications and features, as well as learning how to build and design cubes from structured and unstructured workbooks.
Cube Designer — The Cube Designer extension for Excel is a client interface for designing and building Essbase cubes from application workbooks. This interface offers a flexible and portable cube design and administration system. Structured workbooks simplify everyday cube design, optimization, and portability. Cube Designer infers patterns found in unstructured workbooks, to help you shape raw data into hierachically organized cubes.
Connectivity — Essbase APIs use TLS/SSL for secure connectivity both internally between components and externally with other applications. You can connect from any software using Essbase Runtime Client (RTC) over secure HTTP without needing to open additional TCP/IP ports to enable client connectivity.
Connections and Datasources — Essbase administration tasks often require connectivity to remote source data or hosts. With reusable connections and Datasources, you no longer have to code the connection details into artifacts like rule files or filters, or enter them each time you perform other connection-dependent tasks.
Analysis — You can perform ad hoc data queries/grid analyses on cube data from the administrative Essbase web interface, as a built-in alternative to connecting via Smart View. You can save your grid layouts, run report scripts, and run and save named MDX queries.
Calculation — Essbase offers a rich library of calculation functions and commands to suit most analytical applications, and you can add your own custom defined functions and macros built using Java. Calculation tracing helps you analyze and debug calculation script performance and member formula processing. Tuple-based calculation helps you optimize and refine calculation scope, limiting it to focus on the active Smart View grid. Hybrid mode calculation can be selected, and is enhanced with several tuning options.
MDX Insert and Export — In addition to MDX’s well-known utility as a multidimensional query language, you can use its Insert and Export directives to shape, copy, move, and update any custom slice of multidimensional data.
Aggregate Storage Calculation — You can use MDX Insert to perform custom calculations and allocations. You can automate the creation and maintenance of default aggregate views.
Data Load and Dimension Build — The Essbase web interface load rules editor with built-in data previews enables import of data and dimension from the Catalog or from outside sources. Rule file columns can employ functions like Sum, Min, Max, Count, and Avg to help you shape your import. SQL-based loading has improved performance. Batch Outline Editing can be performed programatically from Java or REST API. Command-line interface (CLI) supports streaming data load from a variety of sources. Aggregate storage data load optimizations are added, including buffer, merge, and cache tuning options.
Drill Through — When you need more data than what you can see in the Essbase cube, you can use drill through reports to access external data sources. Performance is improved for drill through connections to Oracle Database. The flexibility of drill through report design is improved, allowing diversified selection of multiple cells or ranges of cells. Selections can be recursive, non-recursive, level 0, contiguous, or non-contiguous.
Scenario Management — Scenario management offers the ability to build private work areas or “sandboxes” in which users can model different assumptions within the data to see the effect on aggregated results, without affecting the cube.
Shadow Applications — To perform cube modifications and restructures with limited down time, you can create a shadow application that is a copy of the primary application. The primary application continues to serve read-only operations, such as queries, while you perform modifications on the shadow application. You can make the shadow application visible or hidden. For more information, see the Create Shadow Application endpoint in the REST API.
Configuration — Most configuration parameters you need for application tuning should be set per application, using the Essbase web interface. If you install Essbase 21c on independent deployments, you also have control of the system wide configuration defaults in essbase.cfg, if needed.
Logging — Logs are in Oracle Diagnostic Logging (ODL) format. You can download log files from the Essbase web interface. You can use Performance Analyzer to analyze Essbase logs to generate usage and performance statistics.
Migration, Backup/Restore— Lifecycle Management Utility (LCM) makes it easy to migrate on premise applications across Essbase releases and host servers. An additional migration utility that helps migrate users and groups is also available to download from the Console. For deployments on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, you back up your Essbase stack using the infrastructure.",Oracle Essbase
finance,"Oracle Essbase at its core is a data storage tool, which does a particularly good job organizing data for financial reporting, planning, budgeting, forecasting, and analysis at multiple levels of detail. Oracle Essbase stores and structures the data in a meaningful way to be accessed via several Oracle solutions.
To understand what an Oracle Essbase is, it is required at first to have an understanding of an OLAP server. OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) is the technology behind many Business Intelligence (BI) applications. Moving forward from this definition, Oracle Essbase can be defined an an OLAP Server that provides an environment for deploying pre-packaged applications or developing custom analytic and enterprise performance management applications.
Essbase is a multidimensional database management system (MDBMS) that provides a multidimensional database platform upon which to build analytic applications. Essbase began as a product of Arbor software which then merged with Hyperion software in 1998.After the acquistion of Hyperion solutions software by Oracle Corporation,it was marketed as Oracle Essbase.
OracleEssbase is the industry leading multi dimensional online analytical processing server designed to forecast likely business performance levels and deliver what-if analysis for varying conditions. It has no concept of time,no tables or rows but uses the concept of dimensions. Data is stored only in the form of figures (integers).Textual information storage is not supported. Master data is essential and member load must be completed before the data load. Cell level security and ragged hierarchies are supported.
With a rapid application development environment, Oracle Essbase allows its business users to quickly model complex business scenarios. Aside from its high scalability, a key strength of Oracle Essbase lies in its ability to allow users to write back to an applications data repository under security. This makes it ideal for developing forward looking applications such as forecasting, scenario modeling, and what if type analysis. Oracle Essbase provides an opportunity for the organizations to build a dimensional view of their business which helps them to provide their business users a new level of self sufficiency to access, navigate, and gain actionable insight into critical business issues.
 Oracle Hyperion Smart View for Office (Excel,
 PowerPoint, Word, and Outlook),
 and Oracle BI Suite Enterprise Edition Plus, including Dashboards, Answers,
 Hyperion Interactive Reporting, Hyperion Web Analysis,
 Hyperion Financial reporting are some of the various Oracle tools that enable users to interact with an Oracle Essbase application.
Types of Storage options
There are two types of EssBase databases:
1. Block Storage Option or BSO
2. Aggregate Storage Option or ASO
These two Essbase cube types have their own strengths, which help the organizations to choose their best design options.
Block Storage Option:
The block Storage Option has lesser number of dimensions than the aggregate option but shows the business model and can perform numerous and complex calculations on the smaller outlines. It provides special functionalities for Accounts and Time dimensions like Dynamic time series, Time balance, Variance reporting. There are 3 types of partitions Replicated, Transparent, Linked. There is no restriction of the number of databases under one application but performance costs. Data in BSO applications is manipulated using calculation scripts and business rules, which provide the math that Essbase needs to perform. In short BSO applications are great for the manipulation and transformation of data, such as calculating healthcare costs for next year based on a rate, or transforming data based on a series of exchange rates.
Aggregate Storage Option:
ASO cubes are designed to provide rapid aggregation capabilities for much larger Essbase outlines, typically supporting many more (and larger) dimensions. Aggregate storage databases enable dramatic improvements in both database aggregation time and dimensional scalability. The aggregate storage option is an alternative to the block storage option. Aggregate storage databases typically addresses read-only, rack and stack applications that have large dimensionality.ASO allows only one database to be created under one application. Also unlike BSO it is mandatory to follow the naming conventions of Application names. For example, Application name should not be like metadata, temp,log etc..ASO does not support dynamic time series and Time balance properties. When the dimension build process builds any new member then the data will be erased else the data will be alive. Only one type of partition available (Transparent).There is no concept of Sparse and Dense dimensions, no Boolean attribute tag. ASO allows only storing data, and does not allow sharing. Aggregate Storage Option applications are extremely useful for the rapid aggregation of data on the fly. Data is only stored at the detailed level, and aggregated when users request information. In our old retrieval, an ASO cube would only store Retrieval #1, and then aggregate the data on the fly for Retrieval #2. This is particularly useful when we have a large data set that is updated frequently.
For some projects, combining the calculation strengths of BSO with the aggregation strengths of ASO offers the best fit for your Essbase analytical needs. An ASO reporting cube, combining BSO and ASO cubes, is one example.
Features of Essbase:
1. Highly advanced calculation engine
Its highly advanced calculation engine includes more than 350 prebuilt and out of the box functions. It helps in accelerating complex business models development. This comprehensive library enables Oracle Essbase to scale from simple aggregations to complex, cross dimensional allocations. Financial formulas of all types are included to support business model development. In addition, business rules can be created to manage complex calculation requirements using a spreadsheet like syntax. It also requires only single point of maintenance to manage data and business rules
2. Rich User experience
It provides the end users extensive choice of interface and brings powerful OLAP directly to the end users. Query results can be displayed through interfaces of the users choice, including Microsoft Office tools, and the variety of intuitive reporting options which Oracle offers. With the advantage of consistent, sub second response times, users can interact with the data without support from technical experts. This ability to converse with the dataunderstanding that an answer to one question leads to anotherenables business users to better identify and analyze the metrics and relationships that influence performance, and to make better, more informed decisions. Users can share their saved reports, and modify their appearance, or create powerful additional queries.
3. What-if analysis
Users can create further scenarios where they may model for exceptional changes in business and be prepared for turbulent trading conditions through this whatif analysis. This assists fast resolution of business issues and risks to be managed. It can quickly and easily develop and manage analytic applications that can forecast likely business performance levels.
4. Open, scalable, and secure
Oracle Essbase can be populated through a wide variety of tools that allow it to access any commonly recognized data source; the data can then be combined into a single analytic view, so the entire enterprise can be consistently reported upon. Many organizations have multiple, large data sources from which the data needs to be extracted. Oracle Essbase performance is unmatched, offering inherent capabilities to optimize data load and recalculate data sets so results are speedily available to the users. Oracle Essbase enables detailed analysis of terabytes of data for thousands of simultaneous users providing up-to-the-minute, dependable information. This highspeed analysis provides business users speed-of-thought responsiveness to manage performance in real time.Essbase enables detailed analysis of terabytes of data for thousands of simultaneous users, providing up-to-the-minute, dependable information.
5. Multidimensional Representation and Extension
Data is categorized in Oracle Essbase in the form of dimensions, a dimension could for instance represent a time period or a product or a customer There are often relationships between members of a dimension and these relationships are represented by a hierarchy. A hierarchy enables mathematical calculations to be executed against the data, so for example all the sales for individual states can be aggregated to create a value for the entire USA. Oracle Essbase allows multiple hierarchies to be established so data can be speedily calculated or aggregated. Structures in Oracle Essbase such as dimensions and hierarchies are displayed in the Outline, which is a graphical representation that enables authorized users to easily review and maintain structures as business requirements change.
6. Reporting Options
A wide variety of users, from many departments, may have the requirement to use Oracle Essbase. Delivering the information to them in a suitable form is of utmost importance. Data can be delivered to Oracle Business Intelligence Suite Enterprise Edition and in addition presented through a variety of formats including interactive dashboards, financial and production reports, Microsoft Office and advanced data visualization tools. Each of these reporting options suits a particular purpose, but all use the same data, and common data definitions ensuring consistency across the enterprise",Oracle Essbase
finance,"WHAT IS ORACLE ESSBASE? Named by InfoWorld Magazine as one of the top 10 technologies of the 20th century, Oracle's Hyperion Essbase allows users to model, analyze, and interpret the most complex business scenarios.
Essbase is an object oriented database that provides users with multidimensional analysis capabilities.
Essbase Databases are often called ""Cubes"" and are defined by dimensions, which themselves are hierarchical groups of members Data is organized into cross sectional groups that can be accessed by users depending on what sections of the hierarchal dimensions they wish to see. The Dimensions are hierarchical representations of descriptors that business users are familiar with, such as a Product Hierarchy. By simply choosing any point in the various dimension hierarchies users are instantly presented with the data values. Users can drill up or down, or users can pivot different dimensions to form new cross sections and better analyze the data. Essbase is optimized to support On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) as opposed to the more traditional transaction processing (OLTP) found in relational databases. This enables rapid response times for large volumes of users and large volumes of data.
Essbase gets its name from Extended Spreadsheet Database and is commonly accessed via a spreadsheet add-in that provides users the capability to analyze data within a familiar environment such as Microsoft Excel. Essbase can accept data input from end users which makes it a very capable budgeting tool in addition to its analytic capabilities. Essbase also contains a very powerful calculation engine and is often used to create Profitability Costing models or other types of analytic models that require allocations or more advanced calculations. Essbase is the analytical engine of packaged applications such as Hyperion Planning , Oracle BI Solutions , and the multi-dimensional data store for analytical applications
Essbase is mainly used in budgeting and financial services because it is easy to run scenarios using dimensions that allow you to see how any point in the database changes with changes to a single variable. Essbase makes it easier for forecasting results and comparing actual performance to the forecast so that variables can be adjusted on the fly.

finance,"Essbase is a multidimensional database management system (MDBMS) that provides a platform upon which to build analytic applications. Essbase began as a product from Arbor Software, which merged with Hyperion Software in 1998. Oracle Corporation acquired Hyperion Solutions Corporation in 2007. Until late 2005 IBM also marketed an OEM version of Essbase as DB2 OLAP Server.[1]
The database researcher E. F. Codd coined the term ""on-line analytical processing"" (OLAP) in a whitepaper[2] that set out twelve rules for analytic systems (an allusion to his earlier famous set of twelve rules defining the relational model). This whitepaper, published by Computerworld, was somewhat explicit in its reference to Essbase features, and when it was later discovered that Codd had been sponsored by Arbor Software, Computerworld withdrew the paper.[3]
In contrast to ""on-line transaction processing"" (OLTP), OLAP defines a database technology optimized for processing human queries rather than transactions. The results of this orientation were that multidimensional databases oriented their performance requirements around a different set of benchmarks (Analytic Performance Benchmark, APB-1) than that of RDBMS (Transaction Processing Performance Council [TPC]).
Hyperion renamed many of its products in 2005, giving Essbase an official name of Hyperion System 9 BI+ Analytic Services, but the new name was largely ignored by practitioners. The Essbase brand was later returned to the official product name for marketing purposes, but the server software still carried the ""Analytic Services"" title until it was incorporated into Oracle's Business Intelligence Foundation Suite (BIFS) product.[4]
In August 2005, Information Age magazine named Essbase as one of the 10 most influential technology innovations of the previous 10 years,[5] along with Netscape, the BlackBerry, Google, virtualization, Voice Over IP (VOIP), Linux, XML, the Pentium processor, and ADSL. Editor Kenny MacIver said: ""Hyperion Essbase was the multi-dimensional database technology that put online analytical processing on the business intelligence map. It has spurred the creation of scores of rival OLAP products – and billions of OLAP cubes"".[6",Oracle Essbase
