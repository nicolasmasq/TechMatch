3,finance,"What is Excel?
Excel is a spreadsheet program from Microsoft and a component of its Office product group for business applications. Microsoft Excel enables users to format, organize and calculate data in a spreadsheet.
By organizing data using software like Excel, data analysts and other users can make information easier to view as data is added or changed. Excel contains a large number of boxes called cells that are ordered in rows and columns. Data is placed in these cells. Excel is a part of the Microsoft Office and Office 365 suites and is compatible with other applications in the Office suite. The spreadsheet software is available for Windows, macOS, Android and iOS platforms.
Common Excel use cases
Excel is most commonly used in business settings. For example, it is used in business analysis, human resource management, operations management and performance reporting. Excel uses a large collection of cells formatted to organize and manipulate data and solve mathematical functions. Users can arrange data in the spreadsheet using graphing tools, pivot tables and formulas. The spreadsheet application also has a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications.
Organizations use Microsoft Excel for the following:
collection and verification of business data;
business analysis;
data entry and storage;
data analysis;
performance reporting;
strategic analysis;
accounting and budgeting;
administrative and managerial management;
account management;
project management; and
office administration.
Excel terminology and components
Excel has its own terminology for its components, which new users may not immediately find understandable. Some of these terms and components include the following:
Cell. A user enters data into a cell, which is the intersection of a column and row. Cell reference. This is the set of coordinates where a cell is located. Rows are horizontal and numbered whereas columns are vertical and assigned a letter.
Active cell. This is the currently selected cell, outlined by a green box.
Workbook. This is an Excel file that contains one or more worksheets.
Worksheet. These are the different documents nested within a Workbook.
Worksheet tab. These are the tabs at the bottom left of the spreadsheet.
Column and row headings. These are the numbered and lettered cells located just outside of the columns and rows. Selecting a header highlights the entire row or column.
Formula. Formulas are mathematical equations, cell references or functions that can be placed inside a cell to produce a value. Formulas must start with an equal ""="" sign.
Formula bar. This is the long input bar that is used to enter values or formulas in cells. It is located at the top of the worksheet, next to the ""fx"" label.
Address bar. This bar located to the left of the formula bar shows the number and letter coordinates of an active cell. Filter. These are rules a user can employ to select what rows in a worksheet to display. This option is located on the top right of the home bar under ""Sort & Filter."" An auto filter option can be selected to show rows that match specific values.
AutoFill. This feature enables users to copy data to more than one cell automatically. With two or more cells in a series, a user can select both cells and drag the bottom right corner down to autofill the rest of the cells.
AutoSum. This feature enables users to add multiple values. Users can select the cells they want to add and press the Alt and Equal keys. There is also a button to enable this feature on the top right of the home page, above ""Fill"" and to the left of ""Sort & Filter.""
PivotTable. This data summarization tool sorts and calculates data automatically. This is located under the insert tab on the far left.
PivotChart. This chart acts as a visual aid to the PivotTable, providing graph representations of the data. It is located under the middle of the insert page, next to maps.
Source data. This is the information that is used to create a PivotTable.
Key aspects of Excel.
This image shows key features of Excel.
Advanced Excel capabilities
More advanced tools in Excel include the following:
TREND function. This tool is used to calculate linear trend lines through a set of Y or X values. It can be used for time series trend analysis or projecting future trends. Trendlines can be used on charts.
VLOOKUP. The Vertical Lookup, or VLOOKUP function, can be used to search for values in a larger data set and pull that data into a new table. VLOOKUP is a cell input command that looks like =VLOOKUP(). The parentheses include the data the user wants to look up, where to look for it, the column number with the value to return; or optionally, the user can specify an Approximate or Exact match indicated by True or False.
Table Array. This is a combination of two or more tables with data and values linked and related to one another. This is part of VLOOKUP.
Col_index_num. Another value when creating a table array that specifies the column from where data is being pulled.
Range_lookup. This value in VLOOKUP provides information closest to what a user wants to find when nothing matches other variables. This is represented by a true or false label. False gives the exact value a user is looking for and True gives results from a variable data range.
MAX and MIN functions. These functions provide the maximum and minimum values from selected data sets. MAX is used to find the maximum value in a function tab and MIN is used to find the minimum value.
AND function. This function has more than one criteria set when searching variables. If a variable matches the criteria, the value will be returned as true; if not, it will be returned as false. The input for the function should look like this: =AND (logical1, [logical2], ...).
Additional functions for use in Excel include subtract, multiply, divide, count, median, concatenate and other logical functions similar to AND, such as OR.
Excel and XLS files
An XLS file is a spreadsheet file that can be created by Excel or other spreadsheet programs. The file type represents an Excel Binary File format. An XLS file stores data as binary streams -- a compound file. Streams and substreams in the file contain information about the content and structure of an Excel workbook.
Versions of Excel after Excel 2007 use XLSX files by default, since it is a more open and structured format. Later versions of Excel still support the creation and reading of XLS files, however. Workbook data can also be exported in formats including PDF, TXT, Hypertext markup language, XPS and XLSX.
Macro-enabled Excel files use the XLSM file extension. In this case, macros are sets of instructions that automate Excel processes. XLSM files are similar to XLM files but are based on the Open XML format found in later Microsoft Office software.
Excel competitors
Even though Excel might be one of the most recognizable spreadsheet programs, other vendors offer competing products. Examples include the following:
Google Sheets. Google Sheets is a free competitor to Excel, with similar layouts and features. Users with a Gmail account can access Google Sheets. Google Sheets are saved in the cloud, meaning users can access their spreadsheets from anywhere and on numerous devices. Multiple users can also collaborate on the same spreadsheet.
Numbers. Apple's spreadsheet program comes free with every Mac and provides prebuilt templates, charts and graphs. Numbers excels at graphics and charts, but it does not handle large data sets as well as Microsoft Excel. Numbers is also exclusive for Apple's devices. But it does enable users to save spreadsheets as Excel files, so a Windows user can still open a Numbers spreadsheet in Excel.
Apache OpenOffice Calc. This free open source spreadsheet software features multiple user collaboration; natural language formulas that enable users to create formulas using words; DataPilot, which pulls data from corporate databases; and style and formatting features that enable different cell formatting options. The software uses a different macro programming language than Excel and has fewer chart options. OpenOffice Calc works on Windows and macOS platforms. OpenOffice Calc also uses the Open Document Format as its default, with only limited support for Microsoft's XLSX format.
Microsoft Excel vs. Google Sheets.
This image compares Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.
History and future of Excel
Microsoft released Excel in 1985 under the name Microsoft Multiplan. Microsoft's spreadsheet program competed with similar products at the time, including Lotus 1-2-3 from the Lotus Development Corp. Although Lotus 1-2-3 was reportedly the first spreadsheet to introduce cell names and macros, Multiplan used a graphical user interface and enabled users to point and click using a mouse. Multiplan made it easier to manipulate, process and view spreadsheet data.
Initially, Multiplan lost popularity on Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS) systems when competing with Lotus 1-2-3. Two years after its initial release, in 1987, Microsoft introduced Excel version 2.0. By 1988, this new version, now on Windows platforms, began to outsell Lotus 1-2-3 and other similar spreadsheet programs.
In 1990, Microsoft released version 3 of Excel, with features such as toolbars, 3D charts, and drawing and outlining capabilities. Version 4 came along two years later and added the auto-fill function. In 1993, version 5 of Excel was released. This version included Visual Basic for Applications macros, which enabled regular tasks to be automated.
One of the next big updates to Excel was version 12, which was released in 2007. This update used a new Ribbon menu system. Improved functions included a SmartArt set of diagrams, better management of named variables and more flexibility for formatting graphs. Excel moved to using the more structured and open XLSX files as well. Version 15 released in 2013 included new tools such as Power View, Power Pivot and Flash Fill. This version also improved multithreading capabilities.
The current version of Excel, version 16, was released in 2019. Since its conception, Microsoft Excel has become one of the most widely used business applications and is often paired with other Microsoft apps such as Word, Outlook and PowerPoint. Although Microsoft no longer updates Excel as different versions, it rolls out new features and updates automatically over time.
Microsoft Excel is arguably one of the most popular spreadsheet applications and has long since played a role in businesses. However, with the popularity of other current spreadsheet software, Excel now has increased competition. The website askwonder.com claims that the collection of apps in Google Suite, which includes Google Sheets, is used by 2 billion users every month, whereas Microsoft Excel has an estimated 750 million to 1.2 billion monthly global users. Google and Microsoft do not publish monthly usage for either spreadsheet program, so it is difficult to estimate values.",https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/definition/Excel,Microsoft Excel
4,finance,"Excel is the hammer for too many businesses’ nails
Excel is a fine piece of software, but as Public Health England found out, its ubiquity and ease of use does not make it the ideal tool for every job that involves data
Public Health England (PHE) has just given us another reminder of how Excel is the most dangerous software in the world. Not, I hasten to add, because there is anything particularly wrong with it, but rather because so many people use it, that something is simply bound to go wrong.
This time around it was, apparently, falling foul of the xls format 65,535 rows limitation, which makes about as much sense to me, a writer and thus word person, as it did to PHE. The effect being those 16,000 unreported Covid-19 cases, and therefore the failure of any track-and-trace operations upon those people.
Quite why a system costing us taxpayers £12bn is using Excel is just one of those things, really. To manage a database of results, perhaps a database could have been used, but again I’m outside the field looking in, not an expert.
The point I would make, though, is that errors like this are not rare – or not rare enough, at least. From the financial markets, we have the tale of the London Whale. This was JP Morgan playing the Big I Am with tens of billions of dollars. Unfortunately, they were modelling their position using a series of Excel spreadsheets.
Not even linked, the macros, the equations were being cut and pasted over from one to t’other. Not all of them made it accurately, which was a problem. For if what is being played is the price of risk, then your connections between the amount and the price of risk do need to be correct. Some $6bn was lost on this in the end. Which, even for a bank of that size, is real money.
It is also possible to enjoy the EuSpRiG list of disasters – errors, perhaps, some of them – caused by the inappropriate use of spreadsheets.
Appropriate technology
This is, believe it or not, a symptom of the same complaint that many development experts have about poor places. That we should use appropriate technology for the case at hand. The specific examples here are of the importation of some higher technology that doesn’t have the necessary support mechanisms – say, diesel-run irrigation pumps in a place that doesn’t have a secure supply of either the fuel or the spare parts.
Perhaps the screw that Archimedes worked out 2,500 years ago is a better solution in such places? Or, another example, that integrated steel plant that every ex-colonial nation seemed to think was essential – in places without ore, coal or limestone – or the demand for that much metal, either.
People are simply using the wrong technology for the task at hand – that’s the similarity here. But that’s what makes diesel pumps dangerous in the same way that Excel is. And it’s that second that is the serious risk, simply because of how widespread the installation base is.
You IT experts will know better than I what the correct solution to PHE’s problem was. Something in Python, perhaps, or at least the use of VBA. Possibly even a proper database, rather than a spreadsheet. But everyone has the spreadsheet on their corporate machine – surely that means that this is what should be used? Well, no, that is to say that if everyone has a hammer, then everything is a nail, which isn’t how to run matters. It is how to bodge them, but not how to run them.

What if we find we rather like this working from home thing?
Our data is making us “richer” – even if it’s the tech companies getting rich.
Could regulation kill Facebook completely?
A spreadsheet, whether Visicalc, Lotus or Excel, allows something that was never really possible before about the starting date of 1980 – significant exploration of variances in numerical models. It is no exaggeration to say that modern financial markets simply wouldn’t be possible without the ability to do that. Depending on your view of how those markets work out, this might be a good or a bad thing.
But what couldn’t be done before, not with ease, was to make a model, then run it, change one or other variable – or the relationship between them – then run it again. And again, and so explore the entire modelling space to see what might happen. Used for what they are good at, spreadsheets are a marvellous innovation.
Alternative pathways
There is space in complex modelling like JP Morgan’s – which is to explore what might happen if... And then, once the relationships have been worked out, to encode into something more serious for the actual operating calculation of the markets and or the position. Equally, the use of Excel to think about how to tot up testing results by PHE is just fine. That’s what the innovation is for, to be able to test “what ifs” and alternative pathways. But once the working out has been done, the production system needs to be – as those 16,000 reasons tell us – encoded into something more robust.
Which is where our similarity with Archimedes comes in – that appropriate technology. A spreadsheet is, or at least should be, a prototyping tool. That the vast series of calculations that accompany the exploration of the possibility space are more or less automated now allows the exploration of more spaces in more detail. This is excellent; it’s an advance.
But that’s what the tech is appropriate for. Once the probabilities have been explored, it is time to put away the exploratory tool and adopt the production one. As with the geologist hacking at rocks with a pick and hammer to see what they are, but the miner upgrades to a shovel to actually move them.
That is, good computing doesn’t allow anyone to use Excel to actually do anything, even though it’s an excellent tool to find out what to do. This is equally true about good computing from the technical side of specifying it, or the management side of agreeing what to pay for to do it.
Yes, it is entirely true that everyone already has the spreadsheet, the Excel. But this is the same thinking as the man who only has a hammer – the difficulty being that there really are things that are better screwed than nailed.",https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Excel-is-the-hammer-for-too-many-businesses-nails?_gl=1*1924zc0*_ga*MjAzMjAxODMwNC4xNzE3NDEzMDM4*_ga_TQKE4GS5P9*MTcxNzQxMzAzOC4xLjEuMTcxNzQxMzEyMC4wLjAuMA..,Microsoft Excel
5,finance,"Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS and iPadOS. It features calculation or computation capabilities, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Excel forms part of the Microsoft 365 suite of software.
Features
Basic operation
Main article: Spreadsheet
Microsoft Excel has the basic features of all spreadsheets,[7] using a grid of cells arranged in numbered rows and letter-named columns to organize data manipulations like arithmetic operations. It has a battery of supplied functions to answer statistical, engineering, and financial needs. In addition, it can display data as line graphs, histograms and charts, and with a very limited three-dimensional graphical display. It allows sectioning of data to view its dependencies on various factors for different perspectives (using pivot tables and the scenario manager).[8] A PivotTable is a tool for data analysis. It does this by simplifying large data sets via PivotTable fields. It has a programming aspect, Visual Basic for Applications, allowing the user to employ a wide variety of numerical methods, for example, for solving differential equations of mathematical physics,[9][10] and then reporting the results back to the spreadsheet. It also has a variety of interactive features allowing user interfaces that can completely hide the spreadsheet from the user, so the spreadsheet presents itself as a so-called application, or decision support system (DSS), via a custom-designed user interface, for example, a stock analyzer,[11] or in general, as a design tool that asks the user questions and provides answers and reports.[12][13] In a more elaborate realization, an Excel application can automatically poll external databases and measuring instruments using an update schedule,[14] analyze the results, make a Word report or PowerPoint slide show, and e-mail these presentations on a regular basis to a list of participants. Excel was not designed to be used as a database.[citation needed]
Microsoft allows for a number of optional command-line switches to control the manner in which Excel starts.
Functions
See also: Microsoft Power Fx
Excel 2016 has 484 functions.[16] Of these, 360 existed prior to Excel 2010. Microsoft classifies these functions into 14 categories. Of the 484 current functions, 386 may be called from VBA as methods of the object ""WorksheetFunction""[17] and 44 have the same names as VBA functions.
With the introduction of LAMBDA, Excel became Turing complete.
Macro programming
VBA programming
Main article: Visual Basic for Applications
Use of a user-defined function sq(x) in Microsoft Excel. The named variables x & y are identified in the Name Manager. The function sq is introduced using the Visual Basic editor supplied with Excel.
Subroutine in Excel calculates the square of named column variable x read from the spreadsheet, and writes it into the named column variable y.
The Windows version of Excel supports programming through Microsoft's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which is a dialect of Visual Basic. Programming with VBA allows spreadsheet manipulation that is awkward or impossible with standard spreadsheet techniques. Programmers may write code directly using the Visual Basic Editor (VBE), which includes a window for writing code, debugging code, and code module organization environment. The user can implement numerical methods as well as automating tasks such as formatting or data organization in VBA[20] and guide the calculation using any desired intermediate results reported back to the spreadsheet.
VBA was removed from Mac Excel 2008, as the developers did not believe that a timely release would allow porting the VBA engine natively to Mac OS X. VBA was restored in the next version, Mac Excel 2011,[21] although the build lacks support for ActiveX objects, impacting some high level developer tools.[22]
A common and easy way to generate VBA code is by using the Macro Recorder.[23] The Macro Recorder records actions of the user and generates VBA code in the form of a macro. These actions can then be repeated automatically by running the macro. The macros can also be linked to different trigger types like keyboard shortcuts, a command button or a graphic. The actions in the macro can be executed from these trigger types or from the generic toolbar options. The VBA code of the macro can also be edited in the VBE. Certain features such as loop functions and screen prompt by their own properties, and some graphical display items, cannot be recorded but must be entered into the VBA module directly by the programmer. Advanced users can employ user prompts to create an interactive program, or react to events such as sheets being loaded or changed.
Macro Recorded code may not be compatible with Excel versions. Some code that is used in Excel 2010 cannot be used in Excel 2003. Making a Macro that changes the cell colors and making changes to other aspects of cells may not be backward compatible.
VBA code interacts with the spreadsheet through the Excel Object Model,[24] a vocabulary identifying spreadsheet objects, and a set of supplied functions or methods that enable reading and writing to the spreadsheet and interaction with its users (for example, through custom toolbars or command bars and message boxes). User-created VBA subroutines execute these actions and operate like macros generated using the macro recorder, but are more flexible and efficient.
History
From its first version Excel supported end-user programming of macros (automation of repetitive tasks) and user-defined functions (extension of Excel's built-in function library). In early versions of Excel, these programs were written in a macro language whose statements had formula syntax and resided in the cells of special-purpose macro sheets (stored with file extension .XLM in Windows.) XLM was the default macro language for Excel through Excel 4.0.[25] Beginning with version 5.0 Excel recorded macros in VBA by default but with version 5.0 XLM recording was still allowed as an option. After version 5.0 that option was discontinued. All versions of Excel, including Excel 2021, are capable of running an XLM macro, though Microsoft discourages their use.[26]
Python programming
In 2023 Microsoft announced Excel would support the Python programming language directly.[27][28] As of January 2024, Python in Excel is available in the Microsoft 365 Insider Program.[27]
Charts
Graph made using Microsoft Excel
Excel supports charts, graphs, or histograms generated from specified groups of cells. It also supports Pivot Charts that allow for a chart to be linked directly to a Pivot table. This allows the chart to be refreshed with the Pivot Table. The generated graphic component can either be embedded within the current sheet or added as a separate object.
These displays are dynamically updated if the content of cells changes. For example, suppose that the important design requirements are displayed visually; then, in response to a user's change in trial values for parameters, the curves describing the design change shape, and their points of intersection shift, assisting the selection of the best design.
Add-ins
Additional features are available using add-ins. Several are provided with Excel, including:
Analysis ToolPak: Provides data analysis tools for statistical and engineering analysis (includes analysis of variance and regression analysis)
Analysis ToolPak VBA: VBA functions for Analysis ToolPak
Euro Currency Tools: Conversion and formatting for euro currency
Solver Add-In: Tools for optimization and equation solving
Data storage and communication
Number of rows and columns
Versions of Excel up to 7.0 had a limitation in the size of their data sets of 16K (214 = 16384) rows. Versions 8.0 through 11.0 could handle 64K (216 = 65536) rows and 256 columns (28 as label 'IV'). Version 12.0 onwards, including the current Version 16.x, can handle over 1M (220 = 1048576) rows, and 16384 (214, labeled as column 'XFD')

Type of format Spreadsheet
Up until the 2007 version, Microsoft Excel used a proprietary binary file format called Excel Binary File Format (.XLS) as its primary format.[30] Excel 2007 uses Office Open XML as its primary file format, an XML-based format that followed after a previous XML-based format called ""XML Spreadsheet"" (""XMLSS""), first introduced in Excel 2002.[31]
Although supporting and encouraging the use of new XML-based formats as replacements, Excel 2007 remained backwards-compatible with the traditional, binary formats. In addition, most versions of Microsoft Excel can read CSV, DBF, SYLK, DIF, and other legacy formats. Support for some older file formats was removed in Excel 2007.[32] The file formats were mainly from DOS-based programs.
Binary
OpenOffice.org has created documentation of the Excel format. Two epochs of the format exist: the 97-2003 OLE format, and the older stream format. Microsoft has made the Excel binary format specification available to freely download.[34]
Using other Windows applications
Windows applications such as Microsoft Access and Microsoft Word, as well as Excel can communicate with each other and use each other's capabilities. The most common is Dynamic Data Exchange: although strongly deprecated by Microsoft, this is a common method to send data between applications running on Windows, with official MS publications referring to it as ""the protocol from hell"".[36] As the name suggests, it allows applications to supply data to others for calculation and display. It is very common in financial markets, being used to connect to important financial data services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.
OLE Object Linking and Embedding allows a Windows application to control another to enable it to format or calculate data. This may take on the form of ""embedding"" where an application uses another to handle a task that it is more suited to, for example a PowerPoint presentation may be embedded in an Excel spreadsheet or vice versa.
Using external data
Excel users can access external data sources via Microsoft Office features such as (for example) .odc connections built with the Office Data Connection file format. Excel files themselves may be updated using a Microsoft supplied ODBC driver.
Excel can accept data in real-time through several programming interfaces, which allow it to communicate with many data sources such as Bloomberg and Reuters (through addins such as Power Plus Pro).
DDE: ""Dynamic Data Exchange"" uses the message passing mechanism in Windows to allow data to flow between Excel and other applications. Although it is easy for users to create such links, programming such links reliably is so difficult that Microsoft, the creators of the system, officially refer to it as ""the protocol from hell"".[36] In spite of its many issues DDE remains the most common way for data to reach traders in financial markets.
Network DDE Extended the protocol to allow spreadsheets on different computers to exchange data. Starting with Windows Vista, Microsoft no longer supports the facility.[41]
Real Time Data: RTD although in many ways technically superior to DDE, has been slow to gain acceptance, since it requires non-trivial programming skills, and when first released was neither adequately documented nor supported by the major data vendors.[42][43]
Alternatively, Microsoft Query provides ODBC-based browsing within Microsoft Excel.[44][45][46]
Export and migration of spreadsheets
Programmers have produced APIs to open Excel spreadsheets in a variety of applications and environments other than Microsoft Excel. These include opening Excel documents on the web using either ActiveX controls, or plugins like the Adobe Flash Player. The Apache POI opensource project provides Java libraries for reading and writing Excel spreadsheet files.
Other platforms
Excel for mobile
Excel Mobile is a spreadsheet program that can edit XLSX files. It can edit and format text in cells, calculate formulas, search within the spreadsheet, sort rows and columns, freeze panes, filter the columns, add comments, and create charts. It cannot add columns or rows except at the edge of the document, rearrange columns or rows, delete rows or columns, or add spreadsheet tabs.[50][51][52][53][54][55] The 2007 version has the ability to use a full-screen mode to deal with limited screen resolution, as well as split panes to view different parts of a worksheet at one time.[53] Protection settings, zoom settings, autofilter settings, certain chart formatting, hidden sheets, and other features are not supported on Excel Mobile, and will be modified upon opening and saving a workbook.[54] In 2015, Excel Mobile became available for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile on Windows Store.[56][57]
Excel for the web
Further information: Microsoft Office § Office on the web
Excel for the web is a free lightweight version of Microsoft Excel available as part of Office on the web, which also includes web versions of Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint.
Excel for the web can display most of the features available in the desktop versions of Excel, although it may not be able to insert or edit them. Certain data connections are not accessible on Excel for the web, including with charts that may use these external connections. Excel for the web also cannot display legacy features, such as Excel 4.0 macros or Excel 5.0 dialog sheets. There are also small differences between how some of the Excel functions work.[58]
Microsoft Excel Viewer
Microsoft Excel Viewer was a freeware program for Microsoft Windows for viewing and printing spreadsheet documents created by Excel.[59] Microsoft retired the viewer in April 2018 with the last security update released in February 2019 for Excel Viewer 2007 (SP3).
The first version released by Microsoft was Excel 97 Viewer.[62][63] Excel 97 Viewer was supported in Windows CE for Handheld PCs.[64] In October 2004, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2003.[65] In September 2007, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2003 Service Pack 3 (SP3).[66] In January 2008, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2007 (featuring a non-collapsible Ribbon interface).[67] In April 2009, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2007 Service Pack 2 (SP2).[68] In October 2011, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2007 Service Pack 3 (SP3).
Microsoft advises to view and print Excel files for free to use the Excel Mobile application for Windows 10 and for Windows 7 and Windows 8 to upload the file to OneDrive and use Excel for the web with a Microsoft account to open them in a browser.
Impact
Excel offers many user interface tweaks over the earliest electronic spreadsheets; however, the essence remains the same as in the original spreadsheet software, VisiCalc: the program displays cells organized in rows and columns, and each cell may contain data or a formula, with relative or absolute references to other cells.
Excel 2.0 for Windows, which was modeled after its Mac GUI-based counterpart, indirectly expanded the installed base of the then-nascent Windows environment. Excel 2.0 was released a month before Windows 2.0, and the installed base of Windows was so low at that point in 1987 that Microsoft had to bundle a runtime version of Windows 1.0 with Excel 2.0.[120] Unlike Microsoft Word, there never was a DOS version of Excel.
Excel became the first spreadsheet to allow the user to define the appearance of spreadsheets (fonts, character attributes, and cell appearance). It also introduced intelligent cell re-computation, where only cells dependent on the cell being modified are updated (previous spreadsheet programs recomputed everything all the time or waited for a specific user command). Excel introduced auto-fill, the ability to drag and expand the selection box to automatically copy a cell or row contents to adjacent cells or rows, adjusting the copies intelligently by automatically incrementing cell references or contents. Excel also introduced extensive graphing capabilities.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel,Microsoft Excel
6,finance,"Microsoft Excel, spreadsheet application launched in 1985 by the Microsoft Corporation. Excel is a popular spreadsheet system, which organizes data in columns and rows that can be manipulated through formulas that allow the software to perform mathematical functions on the data.Lotus 1-2-3, first sold by the Lotus Development Corporation in 1982, dominated the mid-1980s spreadsheet market for personal computers (PCs) that ran MS-DOS, an operating system sold by Microsoft. Microsoft developed a competing spreadsheet, and the first version of Excel was released in 1985 for Apple Inc.’s Macintosh computer. Featuring strong graphics and fast processing, the new application quickly became popular. Lotus 1-2-3 was not available for the Macintosh, which allowed Excel to gain a following among Macintosh users. The next version of Excel, and the first version to run on Microsoft’s new Windows operating system, followed in 1987. With a graphics-heavy interface designed to run on the latest Windows computers, the powerful program became popular. Lotus was slow to release a Windows version of its spreadsheet, allowing Excel to increase its market share and eventually become the dominant spreadsheet application in the mid-1990s. Later versions of Excel featured significant upgrades such as tool bars, outlining, drawing, 3-D charts, numerous shortcuts, and more automated features. In 1995 Microsoft changed Excel’s naming system to emphasize the primary year of the product’s release. Excel 95 was designed for the latest 32-bit computers that used the Intel Corporation’s 386 microprocessor. New editions appeared in 1997 (Excel 97) and 1999 (Excel 2000). In 2003, Excel 2002 was released as part of the Office XP suite and included a significant new feature that allowed users to recover Excel data in the event of a computer crash.computer chip. computer. Hand holding computer chip. Central processing unit (CPU). history and society, science and technology, microchip, microprocessor motherboard computer Circuit BoardExcel 2007 featured a redesigned user interface, sharing features with the Microsoft products Word and PowerPoint and allowing users to move smoothly between these applications. In addition, chart making, data sharing, security, formula writing, sorting, and filtering were improved.
Spreadsheet, computer program that represents information in a two-dimensional grid of data, along with formulas that relate the data. Historically, a spreadsheet is an accounting ledger page that shows various quantitative information useful for managing a business. Electronic spreadsheets replaced pen-and-ink versions in the late 20th century. Spreadsheets are not limited to financial data, however, and are frequently used to represent scientific data and to carry out computations.The first spreadsheet program was VisiCalc, written for the Apple II computer in 1979. For many users, this application most vividly showed the utility of personal computers for small businesses—in some cases turning a 20-hour-per-week bookkeeping chore into a few minutes of data entry. For example, a simple spreadsheet might hold payroll information with columns for employees’ names and addresses, Social Security numbers, hourly pay, hours worked, tax deductions, and net pay. Cells in the last column could have a formula attached to them to compute pay as a function of cells in the three preceding columns for each employee. The spreadsheet would show the net pay and, upon request, its formula. If tax-withholding rates were changed, all the net pay cells could be easily recomputed.
Spreadsheets are also invaluable in what-if computations. Once a set of formulas have generated data in spreadsheet cells as functions of other cells, one can experiment by changing one parameter, such as a part’s price, to observe its effect on a product’s cost. With appropriate forecasting formulas, the market for the product, and hence the total profit at the old and new price, can then be projected. Used this way, spreadsheets serve the needs of managers, economists, and anyone who works with relationships between types of quantitative information.Since spreadsheets can be programmed, they can also be used for general computations. They are used for modeling in science and engineering, and they are well suited to educational uses—for example, to display the synthesis of sound from simple audio waveforms. Furthermore, since they are two-dimensional grids of cells, they can be readily programmed as cellular automata, systems of cells whose state depends on the states of their neighbours. American mathematician John H. Conway’s “Game of Life” is a simple example, and other cellular automata can model complex physical or biological processes.Today spreadsheets for personal computers generally include the ability to convert data into various types of graphs (such as pie charts and bar graphs) and are often integrated with other software, such as word processors and database programs.",https://www.britannica.com/technology/Microsoft-Excel,Microsoft Excel
7,finance,"Advantages and Disadvantages of MS ExcelAdvantages and Disadvantages of MS Excel
The widely used spreadsheet program Microsoft Excel divides all types of data into columns and rows and enables formula-based data entry and setting. Let's get additional knowledge about MS Excel before trying to comprehend what it is.Data may be entered into the MS Excel spreadsheet application as a table. Data analysis in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets is simple. Microsoft Corporation introduced the spreadsheet program Microsoft Excel in 1985.Advantages and Disadvantages of MS ExcelEven after almost 30 years, MS Excel continues to be the finest in the world. However, in the following paragraphs, we will explain what MS Excel is, how to capture data using it easily, and how easier platforms and programs than MS Excel have succeeded in the modern period.HistoryThe initial version of Microsoft Excel, known as Multiplan, debuted in 1982. It was a highly popular CP/M (control program for microcomputers), but it quickly lost popularity to other software and programs.
Then, in 1987, Microsoft released Excel v2.0 for Windows, and by 1988, Lotus 1-2-3 and the burgeoning Quattro Pro were also being released. VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), often known as macros, was incorporated in Excel v5.0 for Windows when it was first launched by Microsoft in 1993.Additionally, it created almost endless opportunities for the automation of monotonous activities such as data processing, process automation, and data presentation to enterprises.How to start MS Excel?You must also see how MS Excel begins if you want to understand what it is. If you carefully read the methods below, you can access MS Excel on your computer with no trouble at all:
In Windows, first click on Start.Next, choose All Programs.Your following action will be to select MS Office.After that, MS Office selected the MS-Excel option.Suppose you prefer not to go such a long route. In that case, you may start by clicking the Start button, typing ""Microsoft Excel"" into the available search box, and then selecting ""Microsoft Excel"" to begin.How does MS Excel function? What is it?In Microsoft Excel, a file is known as a workbook. There is usually at least one worksheet in a workbook. Worksheet refers to a grid into which you may enter data and do calculations. A workbook may include several worksheets, each of which will have a unique name.Worksheets are organized into rows and columns. A cell is defined as any column and row coming together. You can enter any information in a cell. Large amounts of text, a date, a number, or a formula can all be entered in a cell. Each cell's data entry options include a variety of borders, backgrounds, and font colors, sizes, and kinds.
Some features of MS ExcelMS Excel is not a small program, so it has numerous features; below, we will tell you what else is on this spreadsheet apart from various editing and formatting.I. HomeYou have choices for font size, font style, font colour, background colour, alignment, formatting options, cell insertion and deletion, and editing options under this feature.II. InsertYou may add equations, symbols, graphs, charts, and sparklines, as well as images and figures, tables, headers, and footers, using this tool, which also offers choices for table type and style.III. FormulasAs we previously said, MS Excel has the ability to generate tables with enormous amounts of data. With this feature, you can add a formula to your data table and receive an immediate response.
IV. StatisticsThis category includes tools for adding external data (from the web), filtering choices, and data.V. Review
Under this review category, you may proofread the Excel sheet (for example, run a spell check), and you can make comments on this part with ease.VI. View
The many perspectives you want the spreadsheet to be shown here may be readily modified. This category includes wonderful options like zoom-in and zooms outVII. Page LayoutUnder this page layout option, there are some excellent choices, including theme, orientation, and page arrangement.
UsesMS Excel is known and used all over the world for organising data and doing financial analysis. It is used in all business functions and in small to large companies.The main uses of Excel are:data entrydata managementAccountingfinancial analysisfinancial modellinggraphing and chartingProgrammingCustomer Relationship Management (CRM)time managementtask managementAdvantages of MS ExcelBecause it is simple to preserve data and add and remove information both easily and quickly, MS Excel is used for a variety of functions.
Using MS Excel has several significant benefits, including:Easy data input: MS Excel is frequently used for data entry or analysis since there is no limit to the quantity of information that can be saved in a spreadsheet, making it simple to enter as much data as you wish. Is. In Excel, filtering data is simple and highly useful.Data retrieval is easier: Finding information printed on paper may take longer; however, this is not the case with an Excel spreadsheet. Data can be located and retrieved with ease.Mathematical formulae that are Simple to Use: MS Excel's formula feature has made calculations simpler and faster.More reliable: These spreadsheets, which may be password-protected on a laptop or desktop computer, are significantly less likely to be lost than records or pieces of paper with data that have been written down.One location for all data: When the paperwork was completed in the past, data was housed in separate files and registers. Now that several worksheets may be added to a single MS Excel file, it has become more practical.
Disadvantages of MS ExcelData And Growth: One of the primary issues with MS Excel is that it cannot manage more than a few thousand rows without grinding to a halt. It also imposes file size restrictions. However, there are workarounds, just as there are for every app or software tool issue. If you find yourself in one of these circumstances, don't give up; instead, look at the tools available in Excel and apply them imaginatively to get the desired impact.Difficult To Learn: Another Limitation of MS Excel is that it can be difficult to learn. This is because there are many different elements, such as formulas, functions, and keyboard shortcuts. However, this disadvantage may be alleviated with Excel tutorials for beginners or using templates to start quickly with a good learning method and regular practice.Difficult formulas: One downside of using MS Excel is that there are multiple levels of complexity. For instance, some people could feel more at ease with the thought of doing short work, such as making an inventory list for clients so they can restock their stores, while others might not be familiar with formulae and charts, which could take up significant time. To prevent mistakes, you must be well-versed in grammar and formula usage.No quick autofill features: The lack of rapid autofill features in this program is a further issue. For someone with rudimentary knowledge, not understanding how formulae function might be another difficult experience. As a result, you would have to learn the interface from scratch; yet these drawbacks can also present a chance for ongoing personal growth and development in addition to merely mastering the MS EXCEL skill setErrors in Calculation: The most significant of MS Excel's drawbacks is that there are inaccuracies in computations. When working with fractions or percentages, for example, the decimal point may be lost, resulting in an error on the screen. This might make it tough for someone who doesn't know what they're doing to solve the problem without the aid of a professional. You'll also need to understand how to use the date and currency forms correctly.
ConclusionThe effectiveness of Microsoft Excel is determined by the type of work you want to do with it. In a nutshell, what level do you want to utilize it at? MS Excel is a good choice if you only need it for its basic functions. However, if you are an accountant, you may need to search for a substitute. It would help if you determined the remainder by knowing the advantages and disadvantages of Microsoft Excel for business and learning.",https://www.javatpoint.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-ms-excel,Microsoft Excel
8,finance,"Production planning in Excel - advantages and disadvantagesSpreadsheets have been used for decades to solve many business management tasks. Due to their wide availability, they are used in many manufacturing enterprises, in particular in production planning departments. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using spreadsheets for production planning? What are the alternatives?Production planning in spreadsheets - advantagesExcel and other spreadsheets have been used for production planning for over 40 years. There are many low-cost or free Excel templates available on the internet, such as a production planning template that includes a master production schedule (MPS), inventory management, or project management sheets. You can also find step-by-step instructions online on how to create such templates yourself. What other features of spreadsheets make them so popular in production planning departments?AccessibilityThe most important reason why companies turn to spreadsheets so often is their accessibility. Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets are relatively low cost for companies. There are also completely free spreadsheets available online as part of applications such as OpenOffice or LibreOffice.Quick learning curveAnother aspect of the popularity of spreadsheets is the ease with which most people can get started with them. The vast majority of production planners already have some experience with spreadsheets. As a result, new hires can get up to speed faster and there is less time and money spent on training.Support materials are widely availableBecause spreadsheets are one of the most widely used programs in the world, there is a huge amount of support material available online. From user guides provided by developers to entire forums and groups dedicated to the topic.Collaboration with other systemsData from Excel or Google Sheets integrates well with other systems, such as accounting software or e-commerce platforms. This makes it much easier to transfer data from one system to another. Thus, users can transfer information from a spreadsheet (usually by creating a CSV file) or take information from third-party software and transfer it to a spreadsheet. This allows users, for example, to create customized reports or charts that are not available in other software.Working in the cloudIn the past, one of the disadvantages of spreadsheets was that changes made to the spreadsheets were not automatically made available to all users. After making changes, the spreadsheet had to be emailed to the next user so they could see the changes and add their own. Today, solutions such as Google Sheets or Microsoft 365 offer access to spreadsheets in the cloud, making them available to multiple users at the same time.Good for micro businessesAlthough spreadsheets are no longer the only option available for business management, they still work well in a microbusiness environment, i.e., companies with 1 to 10 employees. Workflows in such companies are usually much less intensive and complex.Planning in spreadsheets - disadvantagesDespite its advantages, production planning using spreadsheets has certain disadvantages and inconveniences. The most important ones includeRisk of human errorManual data entry, which often occurs when using spreadsheets, is prone to human error. Studies conducted in academic centers have shown that the risk of error is closely related to the size of the spreadsheet (number of rows). When a large amount of data is entered into the system, which often happens in production planning, errors (even minor ones) can lead to serious consequences in production.Data entry is time-consumingIn the case of spreadsheets, the need to enter large amounts of data is time-consuming. If you translate this into man-hours, then spreadsheets lose one of the most important arguments in favor of their use - low price.Low scalabilityAs the complexity and volume of data increases, spreadsheets become less intuitive and ergonomic. The low level of user experience leads to a growing reluctance of staff to work with the application. Spreadsheets also do not provide the level of process automation that is needed to manage large production structures.Advanced features require extensive trainingThe basics of working with spreadsheets can be learned in a few days. However, mastering the most advanced features, such as VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) programming, requires tens or hundreds of hours of training.Offline version makes collaboration difficultIf a company is still using spreadsheets in the traditional way, i.e., storing files on a computer and exchanging them via email, it is difficult to create an effective workflow. One in which information is instantly available to all participants. Since production planning is a collaborative process that often requires more people to be involved and have access to information, this can be a serious obstacle.An alternative to spreadsheetsThe disadvantages associated with the use of spreadsheets in production planning have given rise to the development of software designed for this purpose. We are talking about computerized systems of the APS (Advanced Planning and Scheduling) class. They allow you to create highly optimized production plans in a very short time. The QGUAR APS PRO system allows you to plan operations for several products and jobs simultaneously. The created schedule is visualized using an interactive Gantt chart. An authorized user can adjust it by drag and drop if necessary.Unlike spreadsheets, well-built APS systems are also intuitive and easy to navigate. They automate a huge portion of data entry tasks, reducing the risk of human error. APS systems are now available on a subscription basis. By spreading payments over time, there is no need for large one-time costs with an amortization period of several years.",https://quantum-int.com/en/news/production-planning-in-excel-advantages-and-disadvantages/,Microsoft Excel

Like other Microsoft Office products, Microsoft Excel can now be purchased through the cloud on a subscription basis through Office 365.Techopedia Explains Microsoft ExcelMS Excel is a commercial spreadsheet application that is produced and distributed by Microsoft for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS operating systems. It features the ability to perform basic calculations, use graphing tools, create pivot tables and create macros, among other useful features.Spreadsheet applications such as MS Excel use a collection of cells arranged into rows and columns to organize and manipulate data. They can also display data as charts, histograms and line graphs.MS Excel permits users to arrange data in order to view various factors from different perspectives. Microsoft Visual Basic is a programming language used for applications in Excel, allowing users to create a variety of complex numerical methods. Programmers are given an option to code directly using the Visual Basic Editor, including Windows for writing code, debugging and code module organization.History and Future of MS ExcelIn the early days of accessible PC business computing, Microsoft Excel played a central role in bookkeeping and record-keeping for enterprise operations.One of the best examples of a use case for MS Excel is a table with an autosum format.It's very easy in Microsoft Excel to simply enter a column of values and click into a cell at the bottom of the spreadsheet, and then click the “autosum” button to allow that cell to add up all of the numbers entered above. This takes the place of the manual ledger counts that had been a labor-intensive part of business previous to the evolution of the modern spreadsheet.The autosum and other innovations have made MS Excel a must-have for various kinds of enterprise computing, including looking at daily, weekly or monthly numbers, tabulating payroll and taxes, and other kinds of similar business processes.Various types of simple use cases made Microsoft Excel a key end-user technology as well, useful in training and professional development. For a number of years, MS Excel has been included in basic business diploma courses on business computing, and temporary work agencies may assess individuals on their skills with Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel for a wide range of clerical duties.However, as the world of business technology has advanced, Microsoft Excel has become largely obsolete in some ways.The reason for this is a concept called “visual dashboard” technology or “data visualization.”Generally, companies and vendors have come up with neat new ways to present data visually that do not involve end users looking at a traditional spreadsheet with columns of numbers and identifiers. Instead, they look at graphs and charts and other sophisticated presentations, to understand the numbers better and more quickly. People have realized that the visual presentation is far easier to “read.”The principle of data visualization has shifted the use cases for Microsoft Excel. Where businesses may have used Microsoft Excel in the past for, say, hundreds of records, most of today's business use cases involve spreadsheets that handle less than a few dozen values for any particular project.The idea is that if the spreadsheet is longer than a couple of dozen rows, it will be more effective to display the information on a visual dashboard than in a traditional spreadsheet format.[Become a Microsoft Excel Expert in no time with this A-Z Microsoft Excel Course from Udemy]",https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5430/microsoft-excel,Microsoft Excel

This chapter provides an overview of the Excel application along with an orientation for accessing the commands and features of an Excel workbook.MAKING DECISIONS WITH EXCELTaking a very simple view, Excel is a tool that allows you to enter quantitative data into an electronic spreadsheet to apply one or many mathematical computations. These computations ultimately convert that quantitative data into information. The information produced in Excel can be used to make decisions in both professional and personal contexts. For example, employees can use Excel to determine how much inventory to buy for a clothing retailer, how much medication to administer to a patient, or how much money to spend to stay within a budget. With respect to personal decisions, you can use Excel to determine how much money you can spend on a house, how much you can spend on car lease payments, or how much you need to save to reach your retirement goals. We will demonstrate how you can use Excel to make these decisions and many more throughout this text.Figure 1.1 shows a completed Excel worksheet that will be constructed in this chapter. The information shown in this worksheet is top-line sales data for a hypothetical merchandise retail company. The worksheet data can help this retailer determine the number of salespeople needed for each month, how much inventory is needed to satisfy sales, and what types of products should be purchased.Worksheet with centered title, entries for columns titled Month, Unit Sales, Average Price, and Sales Dollars. Total sales calculated in bottom row.Figure 1.1 Example of an Excel WorksheetSTARTING EXCELLocate Excel on your computer.Click Microsoft Excel to launch the Excel application and present you with workbook options.Click the first option; “Blank Workbook”.THE EXCEL WORKBOOKOnce Excel is started, a blank workbook will open on your screen. A workbook is an Excel file that contains one or more worksheets (sometimes referred to as spreadsheets). Excel will assign a file name to the workbook, such as Book1, Book2, Book3, and so on, depending on how many new workbooks are opened. Figure 1.2 shows a blank workbook after starting Excel. Take some time to familiarize yourself with this screen. Your screen may be slightly different based on the version you’re using.Quick access toolbar with commands Excel Help, Zoom slider, view options, and workbook tabs.Figure 1.2 Blank WorkbookYour workbook should already be maximized (or shown at full size) once Excel is started, as shown in Figure 1.2. If necessary locate the Maximize button as shown in Figure 1.3.Maximize icon, workbook title in top left-hand corner not top center as in Figure 1.2.Figure 1.3 Restored WorksheetNAVIGATING WORKSHEETSData are entered and managed in an Excel worksheet. The worksheet contains several rectangles called cells for entering numeric and nonnumeric data. Each cell in an Excel worksheet contains an address, which is defined by a column letter followed by a row number. For example, the cell that is currently activated in Figure 1.3 is A1. This would be referred to as cell location A1 or cell reference A1. The following steps explain how you can navigate in an Excel worksheet:Place your mouse pointer over cell D5 and left click.Check to make sure column letter D and row number 5 are highlighted, as shown in Figure 1.4.Note: Your highlighted column letter and row number may be different than figure shown.Bold outline D5 cell activated.Figure 1.4 Activating a Cell LocationMove the mouse pointer to cell A1.Click and hold the left mouse button and drag the mouse pointer back to cell D5.Release the left mouse button. You should see several cells highlighted, as shown in Figure 1.5.This is referred to as a cell range and is documented as follows: A1:D5. Any two cell locations separated by a colon are known as a cell range. The first cell is the top left corner of the range, and the second cell is the lower right corner of the range.Cell range A1:D5 is highlighted. Multiple worksheet tabs featured at bottom. Shift F11 adds new worksheet to workbook.Figure 1.5 Highlighting a Range of CellsAt the bottom of the screen, you’ll see worksheets. Depending on your version of Excel, you will see either three as displayed above or just one. If you only have one sheet, click the “Insert Worksheet” to add a worksheet. Depending on your version, you instead may have a + sign; a click on the + adds an additional worksheet as well. This is how you open or add a worksheet within a workbook. Add another worksheet so that you now have three sheets displaying here.Click the Sheet1 worksheet tab at the bottom of the worksheet to return to the worksheet shown in Figure 1.5.Keyboard ShortcutsBasic Worksheet NavigationUse the arrow keys on your keyboard to activate cells on the worksheet.Hold the SHIFT key and press the arrow keys on your keyboard to highlight a range of cells in a worksheet.Hold the CTRL key while pressing the PAGE DOWN or PAGE UP keys to open other worksheets in a workbook.THE EXCEL RIBBONExcel’s features and commands are found in the Ribbon, which is the upper area of the Excel screen that contains several tabs running across the top. Each tab provides access to a different set of Excel commands. Figure 1.6 shows the commands available in the Home tab of the Ribbon. Table 1.1 “Command Overview for Each Tab of the Ribbon” provides an overview of the commands that are found in each tab of the Ribbon.Home tab of Ribbon with font, alignment, and formatting options.Figure 1.6 Home Tab of RibbonTable 1.1 Command Overview for Each Tab of the RibbonTab Name	Description of CommandsFile	Also known as the Backstage view of the Excel workbook. Contains all commands for opening, closing, saving, and creating new Excel workbooks. Includes print commands, document properties, e-mailing options, and help features. The default settings and options are also found in this tab.Home	Contains the most frequently used Excel commands. Formatting commands are found in this tab along with commands for cutting, copying, pasting, and for inserting and deleting rows and columns.Insert	Used to insert objects such as charts, pictures, shapes, PivotTables, Internet links, symbols, or text boxes.Page Layout	Contains commands used to prepare a worksheet for printing. Also includes commands used to show and print the gridlines on a worksheet.Formulas	Includes commands for adding mathematical functions to a worksheet. Also contains tools for auditing mathematical formulas.Data	Used when working with external data sources such as Microsoft® Access®, text files, or the Internet. Also contains sorting commands and access to scenario tools.Review	Includes Spelling and Track Changes features. Also contains protection features to password protect worksheets or workbooks.View	Used to adjust the visual appearance of a workbook. Common commands include the Zoom and Page Layout view.The Ribbon shown in Figure 1.6 is full, or maximized. The benefit of having a full Ribbon is that the commands are always visible while you are developing a worksheet. However, depending on the screen dimensions of your computer, you may find that the Ribbon takes up too much vertical space on your worksheet. If this is the case, you can minimize the Ribbon by clicking the button shown in Figure 1.6. When minimized, the Ribbon will show only the tabs and not the command buttons. When you click on a tab, the command buttons will appear until you select a command or click anywhere on your worksheet.Keyboard ShortcutsMinimizing or Maximizing the RibbonHold down the CTRL key and press the F1 key.Hold down the CTRL key and press the F1 key again to maximize the Ribbon.QUICK ACCESS TOOLBAR AND RIGHT-CLICK MENUThe Quick Access Toolbar is found at the upper left side of the Excel screen above the Ribbon, as shown in Figure 1.7. This area provides access to the most frequently used commands, such as Save and Undo. You also can customize the Quick Access Toolbar by adding commands that you use on a regular basis. By placing these commands in the Quick Access Toolbar, you do not have to navigate through the Ribbon to find them. To customize the Quick Access Toolbar, click the down arrow as shown in Figure 1.7. This will open a menu of commands that you can add to the Quick Access Toolbar. If you do not see the command you are looking for on the list, select the More Commands option.Customize Quick Access Toolbar with frequently used commands. Open Quick Access Toolbar via keyboard: Alt, F, T, arrow down. Via Keyboard to open Quick Access Toolbar: Alt, F, T, arrow down.Figure 1.7 Customizing the Quick Access ToolbarIn addition to the Ribbon and Quick Access Toolbar, you can also access commands by right clicking anywhere on the worksheet. Figure 1.8 shows an example of the commands available in the right-click menu.Right click commands: font formatting, cut, copy, paste, insert, delete, clear, filter, sort, insert comment, cell formatting, define name and hyperlink.Figure 1.8 Right-Click MenuTHE FILE TABThe File tab is also known as the Backstage view of the workbook. It contains a variety of features and commands related to the workbook that is currently open, new workbooks, or workbooks stored in other locations on your computer or network. Figure 1.9 shows the options available in the File tab or Backstage view. To leave the Backstage view and return to the worksheet, click the arrow in the upper left-hand corner as shown below.File Tab/Backstage View displays workbook name; Esc Key: return to workbook Save As, Excel default settings. Includes Protect, Inspect, Manage Workbook Info.Figure 1.9 File Tab or Backstage View of a WorkbookIncluded in the File tab are the default settings for the Excel application that can be accessed and modified by clicking the Options button. Figure 1.10 shows the Excel Options window, which gives you access to settings such as the default font style, font size, and the number of worksheets that appear in new workbooks.Options window General tab: Font size, number of worksheets in a workbook can be changed. Other Excel options are Formulas, Proofing, Save, Language, Advanced, Customize Ribbon, Quick Access Toolbar, Add-Ins, Trust Center.Figure 1.10 Excel Options WindowSAVING WORKBOOKS (SAVE AS)Once you create a new workbook, you will need to change the file name and choose a location on your computer or network to save that file. It is important to remember where you save this workbook on your computer or network as you will be using this file in the Section 1.2 “Entering, Editing, and Managing Data” to construct the workbook shown in Figure 1.1. The process of saving can be different with different versions of Excel. Please be sure you follow the steps for the version of Excel you are using.

19,finance,"If you currently work in the finance industry, or have aspirations of doing so, chances are you have heard of a Bloomberg terminal. This Beginner's Guide to Bloomberg tutorial will introduce you to one of the industry's most widely used sources for real-time financial information. This guide is aimed at new Bloomberg users, and will provide an overview of how to use a Bloomberg terminal. If you are a more experienced user, or if after reading this guide you want to go into more detail on Bloomberg's capabilities, please be on the lookout for the Advanced Guide to Bloomberg.In this basic guide, we will examine how to sign up for, install, and access Bloomberg. We will then go on to covering basic navigation on the Bloomberg system. Navigating Bloomberg is somewhat unique in that the system uses a special keyboard with some keys that are different from those found on a ""normal"" keyboard. Therefore, the navigation section of this guide will be important to newcomers. After gaining a working knowledge of these basics, we will then move on to discuss some of the market and news monitor functions that are available on Bloomberg. The remainder of the tutorial will include information on analyzing securities as well as some tips and tricks for getting the maximum possible benefit from this remarkable machine.KEY TAKEAWAYSThe Bloomberg Terminal has been an indispensable data and information system for financial professionals for decades.Once standalone terminals, today subscribers can download and run the Bloomberg software on PC or Mac.Today's terminal offers a wealth of news & headlines, real-time quotes in numerous markets, tools for fundamental and technical analysis, economic research, and more.Installation and AccessThere are two ways to begin using Bloomberg. The first is to subscribe to the Bloomberg service. You can do so by contacting them (general contact number is (212) 318-2000).1The representative you speak with can then take down details of what you are looking for and have someone from the sales team contact you. Pricing and terms of the contract are unique to each user and would be discussed when the sales team contacts you.However, be aware that Bloomberg is an expensive system and that having your own terminal may not be practical for all users. Should you decide to subscribe to your own service, Bloomberg can help you install the software over the phone, or can come out to visit you and assist in installation.2Note: the software can be installed on most PCs or Macs, but the company will give you a special keyboard for navigating the system.The second method of accessing Bloomberg is to find a public facility that has a Bloomberg terminal. Many larger libraries and universities have one, so that is a good place to start looking.3The downside of this approach is that you won't be able to customize the system and will have to share it with other users. However, for many users these drawbacks may be outweighed by the cost savings over subscribing to the system as an individual.Once you have accessed the system, the next trick is to figure out how to navigate. A good starting place would be either to schedule a visit from a Bloomberg customer service representative or to call customer service for some help. Bloomberg is usually quite good at providing technical support and assistance, and a representative should be able to give you a good start on using the terminal.BloombergBloomberg.The screenshot above shows the Bloomberg log-in page. Each user has a user name and password that will allow them to access the system, although at public facilities you might share this with other users. Once you have logged in, you're ready to begin using the Bloomberg system.Basic NavigationThe Bloomberg terminal, from the perspective of the end-user, is a Windows-based application, making it compatible with the popular Excel program, a very important aspect of the system for those in the finance industry. Bloomberg also offers users access to the application online and through mobile devices, via its Bloomberg Anywhere service.4For portfolio managers and brokers, having the ability to access real-time market information from almost anywhere in the world, is an incredibly convenient and important advantage of a Bloomberg subscription.The first thing most people notice when they sit down in front of a Bloomberg terminal, is the keyboard. Although it is similar to a standard desktop keyboard, Bloomberg terminals substitute the function keys on a standard keyboard (i.e., F4) with market sector keys. Additionally, Bloomberg keyboards incorporate color coding to make use more intuitive. The function keys along the top of the keyboard are mostly color coded yellow and allow a user to navigate by asset class: government bonds, corporate bonds, municipals, commodities, equity, currency, and more.5For instance, if a user is interested in examining a stock, they will generally access it through the key. If they want to look at trading the US$ versus the Euro, most functions would be accessed with the key. There are also special function keys for preferred stocks and funds. The Bloomberg keyboard also has a special key for communicating with other users via email or instant message as well as a key that can be used when you require assistance.67Bloomberg KeyboardImage courtesy of Wikipedia.Bloomberg TickersBloomberg uses abbreviations and tickers for most of its functions. For example, someone looking for a quote on Microsoft stock would type in the symbol for Microsoft (MSFT) followed by the key and then hit enter. This would bring up a menu of options relating to Microsoft stock. Since very few users know more than a small fraction of the almost limitless number of available Bloomberg options, these menus present an excellent way to see what sort of analytics are available for a given security or market.Once you are familiar with Bloomberg, you might begin to memorize some of the shortcuts, thereby saving a step for familiar functions (as opposed to going through the menu.) For instance, if you want to see the basic description page for Microsoft's stock, instead of accessing it through the menu, you could instead type and then hit enter. The ""des"" is the abbreviation for description pages on Bloomberg, and this common function will provide a good general overview of most securities.8Note: Because there are an almost unlimited number of functions in Bloomberg, the best way to begin navigating the system is probably to use menus and then select your favorite functions from there. Over time, you can begin to memorize the shortcuts for your most commonly used functions, while continuing to use the menus for less frequent choices.HelpYou will notice that there is a green key on the Bloomberg keyboard. This key can be your best friend, especially when you are new to the system. By hitting the help key once, you can get information about the screen that you are currently viewing. Hitting help twice will send an instant message to the Bloomberg help desk. You can then ask your question via live chat with a Bloomberg specialist who can guide you on using the terminal as well as on whatever particular function you are trying to access.9MessagingOne of the nice features of Bloomberg is that it has a fairly robust messaging system. This system allows users to stay in contact with other users and is one of the reasons that Bloomberg is so ubiquitous in the financial industry. You can look up other users of the system in order to send them a message, and if you contact someone regularly, you can set them up on speed-dial as well. When messaging, you have two choices.The first is to send a traditional message, which is basically like an email. The second is to open up an instant message window with the other user, which, as the name implies, is similar to traditional instant messaging. Both methods work great, so which one you chose is largely a matter of personal preference.10News and Market MonitorsIn addition to analyzing individual securities, a common use of the Bloomberg terminal is to monitor news updates and financial market movements. Here too, there is an endless array of possibilities, and which one users prefer is often a matter of personal choice. However, there are a couple of common screens that can serve as a starting point for new users. Note: When in doubt, the menu functions can also help here. The general menu that you see for most asset classes (including equities, currencies, commodities, etc.) will usually contain listings for market monitors that provide a good starting place for analysis.NewsThe best place to begin looking for news on Bloomberg is by typing or and then hitting . These function bring up a page of the top news stories of the day, which are updated on an ongoing basis. Selecting any of these headlines will bring up the full story. Within the function, there are additional sub-menus that will allow you to view news stories that are filtered by asset class, geographic region, or topic.11For instance, you can choose to see the top worldwide stories, the top U.S. stories, or the top stories for stocks, for bonds, or for almost any other category you choose. You can also (if you are using your own personal Bloomberg) choose to set the default for top news to whichever category you prefer, so that when you type in you see the news category that is most important to you. The screenshot below shows an example of the screen for top worldwide news headlines.NewsNews.As mentioned above, news can also be customized in a wide variety of ways. For instance, if you are primarily interested in the stock market, you can access top news for stocks. The screenshot below displays this. As you can see, the stock news screen is further broken down into sections: first for worldwide headlines, then by continent with North America, followed by Europe and finally Asia. Users seeking even greater detail can click on the regions in white to access stock news headlines specific to a region or country, such as the United States, Canada, Eastern Europe, etc.NewsNews by Geography.Market MonitorThere are a number of market monitor pages that cover a variety of asset classes, as well as some that cover a single asset class or market sector. The monitor below is accessed by typing into your Bloomberg. The PX1 screen is a little bit more focused on the U.S. Treasury bond market, while also giving updates on the Dow, Nasdaq, S&P, as well as the gold and oil markets.Market MonitorMarket Monitor.The screenshot below is another example of a market monitor that is primarily focused on the bond market. This screen can be viewed by typing.12Although this is another bond market screen, you will notice that it covers a broader array of securities than the PX1 function discussed above. In addition to U.S. Treasuries, the BTMM screen shows markets for a wide variety of money market instruments, as well as mortgage-backed bonds and currencies. The BTMM screen also includes quotes on the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P, as well as oil.13Finally, the screen contains a listing of the day's major economic releases, making it easy to keep track of this as well. In addition to PX1 and BTMM, there are a multitude of additional market monitor screens that primarily focus on movements in the bond markets. As you can imagine, there is no one screen that is ""best,"" and which one users prefer is ultimately a matter of personal choice. Market MonitorMarket Monitor.In addition to monitors that primarily track bond markets, there are also a wide variety of monitors that focus on equity markets. As a good starting place, you can pull up the monitor below by typing into your keyboard.14As you can see, this monitor displays equity index movements from around the globe. You can get more detail on additional markets in a given region by drilling down into the menu. For instance, by clicking on the ""Asia/Pacific"" heading, you can access updates on the markets in that region that were unable to fit on the front page due to space constraints.Note: On most of these monitor pages, as well as many other screens, any of the headers in a white font with a number in front of it indicate an additional sub-menu that can be accessed. For instance, on the screen below there is a ""1) Americas"", a ""2) EMEA"" and a ""3) Asia/Pacific"" that can all be accessed either by clicking on them or by typing in the appropriate number and hitting . There are also choices at the top marked by ""95) Settings"" and ""96) News"" that represent sub-menus as well.15Market MonitorMarket Monitor.EconomicsIn addition to monitoring market indices and news headlines, the Bloomberg terminal can also be used to monitor economic forecasts and releases. By typing you can access the main economics page.16This page gives a listing of all upcoming economic data releases, as well as consensus forecasts of what economists at major banks and brokerages are predicting those numbers will be. Upon release, the ECO screen also shows the actual number, as well as any revision to the previous month's report. For those interested in overseas markets, there is an ECO page for most major economies.17By using the dropdown menus for ""Region"" and ""Country"" you can access economic forecasts and data from Europe, China, and elsewhere, in addition to the United States. The screenshot below displays a basic ECO screen with data for the United States.EconomicsEconomics.Analyzing Securities and CurrenciesIn addition to monitoring news and markets, Bloomberg can also be used to analyze individual securities. In fact, the analytics available in Bloomberg are quite robust, and they cover a number of major asset classes including equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities, mutual funds and ETFs. This guide will attempt to cover some of the basic functions that are available. To learn more, contact a Bloomberg representative for training, read Investopedia's Advanced Bloomberg Guide, or explore additional functions in a hands-on manner.If you are uncertain what the ticker symbol is for a security you want to look at, you can find the ticker by hitting the key for the asset class you are looking at followed by.18For example, if you wanted to analyze Microsoft stock but didn't know the ticker, you could hit and then type in Microsoft and the ticker would appear. Note: using this function will pull up a list of all the tickers for that company. For instance, if a stock is listed on multiple exchanges, all of them will appear. Therefore, it is important to make sure you select the correct security from the list when using this function (for instance, in this example most users would be seeking the ticker for Microsoft stock listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange).Once you have the correct ticker, the basic screen for beginning security analysis is the description page, Bloomberg abbreviation.8The screenshot below shows page one of the Bloomberg description for Microsoft stock (similar screens are also available for many types of bonds and other asset classes). As you can see, the description page provides a brief overview of what the company does, as well as basic information such as a price quote, 52-week high and low, market capitalization, earnings per share, P/E Ratio, dividend yield, and more. The page below is only the first page of ten pages of security description information.By scrolling forward, you can access additional information, including contact details for the company, and a breakdown of the company's revenue and earnings by geographic region and market segment. You can also find detailed financial data such as an income statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet.19(Note: the financial data can sometimes be a bit dated, so you might want to double check the date listed next to the financial statements if seeing the most recent data is important to you.) AnalysisAnalysis.In addition to looking at descriptive information or financial fundamentals, Bloomberg can also be used to analyze a security's price history and trading patterns. By typing into the system, users can access a price history for whatever security they are looking at, while typing will bring up a simple graph of that price history.20For users interested in more advanced technical analysis, Bloomberg offers an advanced suite of charting capabilities. While a complete description of available charts is beyond the scope of this article, some of the tools available include relative strength indicators (RSI), Bollinger Bands®, intraday price and volume charts, candlestick charts, and comparison charts displaying multiple securities.21An example of a simple price and volume chart for Microsoft stock is displayed below.AnalysisAnalysis.Bloomberg also provides easy access to company updates. For instance, in addition to the top news stories discussed, Bloomberg also offers company-specific news. For example, once you have pulled up a security (such as Microsoft stock) you can type into the Bloomberg and a scrolling list of the most recent news stories concerning that security will come up. You can then click on any of those headlines in order to read the full story. Additional security specific information that can be found on Bloomberg includes earnings estimates (Bloomberg ticker EE), analyst recommendations (Bloomberg ticker ANR), and credit ratings (Bloomberg ticker CRPR).2223More on analyzing specific asset classes is below.EquitiesWhen searching for publicly traded equity shares, Bloomberg allows users to search by name, exchange, country, and other such topics. Additionally, the equity menu allows users to view historical pricing on a stock (see image below), read a description of the business, view any outstanding corporate debt the company may have, and view analyst reports and estimates for the stock, along with dozens of other features. This menu also allows users to search for indexes such as the S&P 500 or Russell 2000.24EquitiesEquities.Bloomberg also allows clients to compare and contrast equities side by side, offering a comparative analysis of any two equities. Comparison fields include fundamental analysis, historical ratios, and technical charting. In addition to comparative functionality, Bloomberg also includes screeners, allowing clients to screen for stocks using a multitude of metrics.25After running a screen, users can also filter results and create custom equity sets, which allow for a quick reference of real-time results for a portfolio of equities (very handy for traders, brokers and other such financial professionals).Fixed IncomeMuch like with equities, Bloomberg allows users to search for real-time data on fixed income securities. This includes corporate debt, municipal bonds, and government bonds.26Similar to the historical price screen for equities, we are able to view historical day-over-day changes in security values, along with implied yield-to-maturities, for any given day. Additionally, credit ratings and cost of capital information is available for fixed income securities.27DerivativesOne of Bloomberg's best features is its derivatives capabilities. Not only can clients find real-time values for securities, such as exchange traded options, and futures contracts, such as the active contract for WTI, but Bloomberg also allows users to value hard-to-price derivatives. For OTC options, for example, Bloomberg lets users customize their option valuation models, to come up with an estimated value.28A user can decide to value an OTC option on the S&P 500 using the continuous Black-Scholes model, using historical volatility (see image below), for example. Once priced, users can view the values of the Greeks associated with the option in question, to verify that their price estimate is in line with those expectations.DerivativesDerivatives.SWAPSSWAPS are a type of derivative used by large banks and institutional investors. The Bloomberg Terminal has a SWAP manager tool that is a highly customizable swap pricing utility. It allows users to input the parameters of a swap agreement and come up with an estimate for the value of that swap, at any given date in time. Additionally, clients can view underlying swap curves to determine that the underlying inputs match expected values. As the swap market continues to grow, the Swap Manager tool will no doubt gain more and more popularity with analysts.29Foreign ExchangeWith the FX market being a 24-hour marketplace, Bloomberg is the ideal tool for FX participants. Users can view real-time rates for dozens of currencies, along with basis curves for most pairs, and rate information for a given currency. Additionally, with Bloomberg's ability to capture real-time news and economic updates, its FX capabilities are a very powerful tool for those trading in the foreign exchange market.30Tips and TricksBecause Bloomberg has such a robust suite of analytics and market capabilities, getting the system to do what you want it to can be a challenge, at least until you become familiar with it. Fortunately, there are some tricks that can speed up your learning curve. Make use of the function: Bloomberg provides excellent customer support; make use of it by hitting the key when you need assistance. Remember, hitting once describes the function you are using; hitting it twice will connect you to customer support via instant message.9Schedule a visit from a Bloomberg representative: Particularly if you have your own system, you should take advantage of a visit from a Bloomberg representative who can walk you through the system and show you how to use some of the functions that might be helpful for what you intend to do.Get Bloomberg ""cheat sheets"": Bloomberg puts out ""cheat sheets"" that list common functions and their Bloomberg tickers. These sheets are broken down by assets class, so if you intend to analyze equities, get a sheet with the most common equity functions, if you like fixed income, get a fixed income guide, etc. These ""cheat sheets"" should give you a good starting point for navigating common Bloomberg functions.31Visit Bloomberg University: By typing or into the system, you will be taken to a screen that offers a wide variety of training videos, informational papers and live seminars. The seminars are broken down by region, so you might be interested in attending one in your area (there is a fee for some of the seminars, but the majority are offered free to Bloomberg users). Incorporate Excel into Bloomberg: Bloomberg connects rather seamlessly with Excel, so you can use spreadsheets to analyze data downloaded from Bloomberg. Even better, you can build a spreadsheet that automatically updates your data each time you open it, saving you the trouble of doing so by hand. Best of all, Bloomberg offers sample spreadsheets for common types of analysis (i.e. tracking stock price movements or analyzing company balance sheets), thereby saving you the trouble of building your own spreadsheet. You can also further customize these generic spreadsheets that Bloomberg offers in order to fit your specific needs.32If you are interested in incorporating Excel spreadsheets into Bloomberg, type to access the Excel main menu on Bloomberg.33How Much Does the Bloomberg Terminal Cost?For a standard license, a Bloomberg Terminal costs around $2,000 per month, or $24,000 per year.Can You Place Trades from the Bloomberg Terminal?Yes. You can place order in several markets using sophisticated order routing and complex order tools.How Many Bloomberg Terminal Users Are There?According to the company, there are more than 325,000 paid subscribers to the Bloomberg Terminal.34The Bottom LineThis basic guide to Bloomberg has provided an introduction to one of the most practical tools participants in the financial markets can use. Unfortunately, Bloomberg can be expensive, which means that having a home system may not be practical for many readers. On the positive side though, it is often possible to access a Bloomberg terminal through a public site such as a library or university. Because there are so many functions available in Bloomberg, this guide has been able to provide no more than a simple introduction to the system, along with an overview of some common tools that users might find useful. Once you begin using Bloomberg, you will undoubtedly find a great many more tools that fit your particular investment and trading style.Readers interested in a more in-depth examination of Bloomberg may also want to keep an eye out for the Advanced Guide to Bloomberg on the Investopedia website. The Advanced Guide will provide more detailed instructions on how Bloomberg can be used to analyze, monitor, and trade some of the major asset classes, including stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities. Beyond that there are also several other tutorials available to those interested in learning more, including those offered directly from Bloomberg itself. Furthermore, many Colleges and Universities are offering Bloomberg courses, to help students gain early exposure to the most widely used tool for real-time financial data in the world of finance. Once you are equipped with some training, it is just a matter of sitting down with the system and familiarizing yourself with it. As with many systems, in the end the best way to learn Bloomberg is through hands-on trial and error.","https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionaleducation/11/bloomberg-terminal.asp#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20monitoring%20news,commodities%2C%20mutual%20funds%20and%20ETFs.",Bloomberg Terminal

Great toll, but expensiveReviewed on 27/01/2023is a comprehensive financial tool providing real-time data, news, analytics, and trading capabilities. The support is very helpful. However, it is costly and requires a dedicated computer or device to access. Overall, it is a valuable resource for those in the industry.Pros-Provides real-time financial data and news-Has advanced analytics and trading capabilities-Widely used and respected in the finance and investment industryCons-Expensive subscription cost-Requires a dedicated computer or device to access-Some features may be overwhelming for less experienced users
Terminal TwilightI use the terminal for commodities and equities. The commodity portion has gotten steadily worse since 2018. Data disappears, much of the cash pricing is in accurate and a mess. I have taken to using a competing product for commodity data. It is fine for equities and IB, which I need. If you need commodity data, any of the competitors offer a much better product at a lower price.ProsThe charting and graphing tools generally work well.ConsData is often incorrect and should not be taken at face value. Data sets seem to disappear without warning, so relying on it vs the competition can be problematic. The product seems to be getting buggier every day. The news is at least for commodities is awful...slow, stale, and not at all cutting edge.
Bloomberg Terminal is vital tool for fixed income managersProsI like the ability to not only see macro level details on economic and market statistics, but the ability to do a ""deep dive"" into all of these metrics. Also, the bond analytical tools are vital for me.ConsThe cost is overwhelming compared to all other software that I use. Only professionals like me can afford something like this.

22,finance,"The Bloomberg Terminal is a computer software system provided by the financial data vendor Bloomberg L.P. that enables professionals in the financial service sector and other industries to access Bloomberg Professional Services through which users can monitor and analyze real-time financial market data and place trades on the electronic trading platform.[1] It was developed by employees working for businessman Michael Bloomberg. The system also provides news, price quotes, and messaging across its proprietary secure network. It is well known among the financial community for its black interface, which has become a recognizable trait of the service.[2] The first version of the terminal was released in December 1982.Most large financial firms have subscriptions to Bloomberg Professional Services. Many exchanges charge their own additional fees for access to real time price feeds across the terminal. The same applies to various news organizations.All Bloomberg Terminals are leased in two-year cycles (in the late 1990s and early 2000s, three-year contracts were an option), with leases originally based on how many displays were connected to each terminal (this predated the move to Windows-based application). Most Bloomberg setups have between two and six displays. As a data analytics and electronic trading platform, the Bloomberg terminal is available for an annual fee of around $24k per user or $27k per year for subscribers that use only one terminal.[3] As of 2022, there were 325,000 Bloomberg Terminal subscribers worldwide.[4]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Terminal,Bloomberg Terminal

But it was not until the late 15th century that we saw the genesis of modern bookkeeping with the popularization of double-entry accounting by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli. With it, businesses could see both their present (debit) and future (credit) situation, and a rudimentary financial management system was born. Of course, modern financial management systems would be unrecognizable to signore Pacioli.Financial management system definitionA financial management system is the software and processes used to manage income, expenses, and assets in an organization. In addition to supporting daily financial operations, the purpose of a financial management system is to maximize profits and ensure long-term enterprise sustainability. They help finance teams:Streamline invoicing and bill collectionOptimize daily, monthly, and yearly cash flowMaintain audit trails and comply with accounting regulationsAutomate finance processes and reduce accounting errorsDeliver better budgeting, forecasting, and planningSpeed up financial close and reporting activitiesAnd much moreFinancial management software can be part of a company’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which consolidates financial and operational data and provides teams with a comprehensive view into the business. Standalone financial applications can also be combined to create an end-to-end financial management system. Increasingly, CFOs are choosing cloud-based ERP and financial management software that can rapidly scale to handle growth and provide functionality for different geographies, languages, currencies, and regulations.Financial management system screen shotScreenshot showing how financial management systems allow you to monitor and manage spend variance.Essential components of a financial management systemAn effective financial management system provides companies with a full suite of accounting software and a single source of truth. Within the system are many different tools, which can be grouped into the following four categories:General accounting and financial close: Tools for accounting and financial close support essential bookkeeping activities such as general ledger, accounts payable (AP), accounts receivable (AR), and payroll. They help teams generate reports, create financial statements for income, expenses, and balances – and close the books quickly and with less effort. Tax management features also help ensure tax accuracy and compliance.Financial management system – accounts receivableFinancial management system showing accounts receivable status.Revenue, cash, and treasury management: With revenue accounting tools, finance teams can automate billing processes, view up-to-the-minute payments, and ensure compliance with statutory regulations for revenue recognition, such as IFRS 15. Cash and treasury management tools help teams predict cash flow, improve liquidity, and proactively mitigate risk. This software also integrates with banking systems, so users can get real-time visibility into bank balances and simplify reconciliation in accounts.Financial planning and analysis: This set of planning, forecasting, budgeting, and analytical tools help CFOs and their teams support the company’s overall financial health. FP&A software is critical for analyzing costs and profitability, improving performance, predicting and navigating future conditions, and providing fast and accurate decision support to the C-suite. It also supports multi-scenario planning and collaboration between finance and every other department.Governance, risk, and compliance: GRC tools help teams align organizational activities to business goals, identify and mitigate different types of risk, and ensure compliance with laws and regulations – from GDPR and SOX to international trade agreements. By synchronizing data across corporate governance, risk management, and compliance activities, companies can operate more efficiently, navigate uncertainty, and act with integrity.GRC software screenshot GRC software helps companies monitor and manage capital availability and associated risks.Digital finance transformation and new technologiesMost companies are still in the early stages of applying digital technologies like cloud, augmented analytics, robotic process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain to finance processes – but they are on the cusp of a major shift and the pressure is on. Not only are CFOs and their teams increasingly expected to provide rapid decision support to the business, but hard lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic are forcing leaders to accelerate finance transformation and new technology adoption.It’s easy to see why. The benefits of digital finance transformation – like instant intelligence, highly accurate predictive modeling, and more agile and automated processes – are the ingredients companies need to navigate change and adapt to the new normal. AI in particular is a driving force behind finance transformation, completely revolutionizing finance analytics, automation, and every process – from financial closing activities to risk mitigation and compliance.In the coming decade, AI will optimize or transform nearly every activity in finance.GartnerCloud financial management: In addition to scalability, cost-efficiency, and the ability to connect to more Big Data sources, cloud-based ERP financial management offers secure access to the system from anywhere – which is especially important now that so many employees are working remotely. The cloud is also the gateway – and prerequisite – to new and intelligent technologies like AI, machine learning, and blockchain.Advanced finance analytics: Finance analytics powered by AI and machine learning can mine massive sets of structured and unstructured data – from inside and outside the organization – in near-real time. These analytics empower finance professionals to create more accurate forecasts and plans, model future scenarios, understand the financial impact of potential decisions, generate on-demand reports, and predict risk and opportunity. Ultimately, advanced finance analytics can be used to steer the business in the right direction and ensure long-term sustainability.Finance automation: Ninety percent of corporate controllers will soon be using a combination of RPA and AI to automate everything from financial reports and closes to tax preparation and payroll. RPA bots not only automate repetitive tasks and free up workers to focus on higher-value work – they can complete more work faster, minimize costs and errors, optimize workflows, and orchestrate activities across human-bot teams.Blockchain: In finance, blockchain technology offers new levels of transparency, efficiency, and security. For example, finance teams can use blockchain to create a single, immutable ledger that’s always up-to-date and doesn’t require reconciliations. Blockchain-based smart contracts – contracts that automatically execute once predetermined conditions are met – can also be used to automate and accelerate activities like payment processing and regulatory compliance.#1advanced finance analytics was a top priority for finance leaders in 2020Gartner 80%of finance leaders have implemented or are planning to implement RPAGartner The best cloud-based financial management systems now embed intelligent technologies like advanced analytics, AI, machine learning, and blockchain directly into their tools – which dramatically speeds up finance transformation and offers rapid time to value and ROI.",https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana/what-is-financial-management-system.html,SAP Financial Management

Additional applications were often needed to bring everything together for analysis and variance reporting.SAP BPC Key FeaturesSAP BPC is known for several key capabilities:Financial Consolidation: Facilitates financial consolidation processes, helping companies streamline reporting, eliminate errors and stay compliant with regulatory requirementsFinancial Planning: Enables business planning to create detailed budgets and forecasts, incorporating various factors (e.g., historical data, market trends and business objectives)Workflow: Automates workflow processes related to planning, budgeting and consolidation, reducing manual effort and improving efficiencyReporting and Analysis: Delivers reporting and analysis capabilities, allowing users to generate customizable reports, perform ad-hoc analysis and gain insights into financial performanceData Integration: Integrates with various data sources – including ERP systems, databases and spreadsheets – bringing all financial data for consolidations, planning, reporting and analysis into one solutionSAP BPC ProsOne application to manage financial consolidation and planning processesBuilt-in financial intelligence and workflows to streamline consolidation and planning processesFlexible deployment and integration options with SAP systems and toolsSAP BPC ConsSAP BPC is in end-of-support, set for 2030A lack of feature parity in future solutions to replace SAP BPC (Group Reporting for consolidations requiring S/4HANA to be implemented first, SAC for planning)SAP BPC AlternativesEnterprises today are looking to replace SAP BPC with more modern, cloud-based approaches to CPM/EPM. Many SAP BPC alternatives take the traditional multi-solution approach to CPM, which still results in complex management of multiple solutions, interfaces and integrations. However, solutions such as OneStream unify consolidation, close, and financial & operational planning, reporting, and analysis in one platform.Enterprises therefore have options to achieve organizational CPM/EPM goals and, with the right choice, can get closer to that elusive one source of truth. The following solutions are the best alternatives for end-to-end management of enterprise-wide consolidation, close, and financial & operational planning and forecasting:",https://www.onestream.com/fr/blog/sap-bpc-competitors-pros-cons-and-review/,SAP Financial Management
