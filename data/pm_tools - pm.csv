Project Management,"What Is Trello and Why Should You Use It in Your Business? Trello is huge right now and it’s only getting bigger. They recently announced that they’ve surpassed 25 million users worldwide, making it one of the most popular productivity and project management apps out there. That’s up from 19 million users just 1 year ago, right about the time they were acquired by Australian software firm Atlassian. And it’s not just regular people using the app to meal prep or clean their home. Trello is being used by industry-dominating businesses like Google and world-changing organizations like the Red Cross. With that kind of global adoption, it’s got to be able to help you and your business get more done in less time, right? That’s exactly the question we aim to answer in this post. From what Trello is, to how it works, to its essential features, we’ll cover everything you need to know so you can decide whether you should use it in your business or not. What is Trello? Well, in Trello’s own words: “It’s a collaboration tool that gives you a visual overview of what is being worked on, who is working on it, and how far they’ve gotten.” Trello is like the Instagram of task management apps or the digital equivalent of Post-It Notes and bulletin boards. It’s a visual stream of every task for every project in your business and life. You can plan and execute a new product just as easily as a family vacation. The best part? It was designed for anyone to use, not just project managers – making it accessible for small teams of 3-10 to SMB’s with 250+ employees. Trello’s simplicity means it’s easy to learn and use. No wonder it’s being adopted by small and large businesses alike. But instead of just telling you it’s good, let’s show you how it works so you can see how good it is for yourself. ‍ How Does Trello Work? Trello is based on the Kanban system of project and task management. Kanban is a Japanese word that roughly translates to “card,” “sign,” or “billboard.” Kanban was developed by Toyota engineers to streamline their production process. Line workers at Toyota’s factories use a “kanban” (an actual card) to signal the steps in their manufacturing process. This allows every employee to quickly communicate with one another using standardized cues that everyone understands instantly – streamlining their workflow. Similarly, Trello uses boards, lists, and cards to create a simpler visual system of project management. These 3 basic elements of the app provide a visual layout of your work for high-level decision-making and ground-level action-taking. Here’s an overview of each: Boards : Boards can be created to hold all the tasks and relevant information for a particular product or project. Lists : Lists represent categories within a board; they’re often used to represent a stage of progress (i.e. to-do, doing, done). You can create as many lists as you want to track ideas, information, and progress regarding your board (project).‍ Cards : A card represents a single, specific element of a project, like a task or idea.Cards are fluid, meaning they can be rearranged inside one list or moved from one list to another.
They’re also versatile. You can simply write plain text on them, or you can fill them with checklists, images, and attached files. What are Trello’s Project Management Features?
‍A bunch of Trello’s features
‍
Beyond its basic elements, Trello offers a range of features that give you complete control over your projects and allows you to customize your workflow to fit your particular style or needs. Here are just a few of Trello’s top project management features:
Home View
Trello recently rolled out its newest feature, home view.
Home view shows you everything happening across your boards, including due dates, card notifications (from team members), and what actions you can take next to move your project forward.
It gives you a bird’s eye view of all your projects so you can easily reorient yourself with what you’re working on and working toward at any time.
Team Collaboration
The ability to collaborate with an unlimited number of team members is one of Trello’s best features.
Every board has a defined set of members that can see it and create or move cards between lists. You can set the visibility of the board so that your entire team can join the board at will or you can invite specific employees to collaborate as needed.
You can delegate tasks by assigning specific team members to cards, then everyone can discuss those tasks in the card’s comments section.
This makes collaboration in Trello seamless and straightforward.‍
Checklists
Checklists allow you to create subtasks and smaller steps within a card. They can be added, edited, or deleted at will.
You can convert a checklist into a card if need be and assign team members to specific items on the checklist.
This makes it super easy to break down big projects and tasks into manageable action steps.
Labels
Labels are very similar to tags in Evernote or hashtags on social media.
They let you categorize and sort cards in any way you want. You can apply an unlimited amount of labels to each card.
You can simply use the color of a label to organize your cards or give each label a name for more descriptive filtering.
And with label filters, you’re able to see only the cards you want to see when you want to see them for improved focus and productivity.
Due Dates
Trello’s due dates help keep you on track so you never miss a deadline.
When you give a card a due date, you’ll get a reminder 24 hours ahead of time to help you complete your tasks on time.
As with everything else in Trello, due dates are highly visual. They’ll appear as a tiny badge on the card that changes color according to how close you are to the due date.
Grey means you have more than 24 hours to finish
Yellow means you have 24 hours left to finish
Red means it’s due
Light pink means it’s past due
Green means it’s complete
Due dates are very effective at instantly telling you what’s the most important task you have to complete and what can wait.‍
Attachments
Attachments enable you to keep all the resources you need to get your tasks done in one place.
Whether you’re pulling in files from your computer, Google Drive, Dropbox or any other location, it all gets stored neatly inside the card you attach it to.
With this feature, you’ll never have to search through unorganized computer docs or random OneDrive folders to find the materials you need to complete your tasks.
Subscriptions
Subscriptions let you receive notifications about anything that happens to a card. All you have to do is click the subscribe button on the back of a card.
You’ll be alerted when someone leaves a comment, adds a due date, moves the card, or does anything else important.
This is an especially useful feature for project managers who aren’t actively working on cards but want to keep tabs on progress being made on those cards in real-time.
‍
What are Trello’s Essential Integrations?
‍Some of Trello’s essential integrations
Trello has a grand total of 87 integrations called “Power-Ups” that allow you to pair Trello with some of the best productivity apps out there.
Here are a few of our favorites:‍
Google Drive
The Google Drive Power-Up allows you to attach or drag and drop docs, spreadsheets and entire folders into Trello’s cards.
This makes it possible to collaborate on your documents and tasks simultaneously with ease.
Slack
The Slack Power-Up lets you send Trello cards to your Slack channels, set alerts in Slack for activity on cards in Trello, and attach whole Slack conversations to cards in Trello to make them actionable.
Slack is an almost too-perfect pairing with Trello for streamlined collaboration and communication. (If you’re wondering what slack is, it’s high-time to get in the know.)
‍
Card Repeater
The Card Repeater Power-Up enables you to set regular tasks on repeat such as weekly meetings, regular bookkeeping, or password updates.
If you do anything more than once and you don’t want to recreate the same card every time you do it, this Power-Up makes it happen automatically.
Zight (formerly CloudApp)
Zight (formerly CloudApp) lets you communicate visually by making it easy to create GIFs, screen recordings, and annotated screenshots.
Our Power-Up makes collaborating with Trello faster, easier, and more fun by allowing you to attach your visuals to cards.
With Trello and Zight (formerly CloudApp), you can request design changes with an annotated screenshot, and fix bugs faster by visually explaining broken workflows with an HDvideo screen recorder, or celebrate a big win with a fun GIF.‍
Calendar
The Calendar Power-Up lets you see all your cards with due dates displayed visually on a built-in calendar that syncs across all your devices. You can even drag cards from one calendar date to another to change its due date.
This brings Trello’s visual workflow to a whole other level.
GitHub
The GitHub Power-Up allows developers and managers to stay on top of their commitments by attaching pull requests directly to cards, start working in GitHub with one click from a Trello card, and associate multiple GitHub repositories within a single board.
GitHub users can now feel confident working on multiple projects without falling behind or missing a commitment. (For the non-programmers reading this, here’s a post that explains what GitHub is).

Starting with Trello is straightforward. The platform is intuitive and welcoming, especially for newcomers. Here's a simple guide to getting started with Trello for beginners.
First, create an account on Trello's website. Once you've logged in, you can create your first board. Boards are the primary organizational structure in Trello. They represent the bigger picture, such as a specific project or a department.
Inside each board, you will have lists. Lists can be seen as stages of your project or categories of tasks. Then come to the cards, the Trello basic units of Trello. They represent tasks and can be moved across lists to signify progress.
Here is a Trello example to give you an idea. Let's assume you are managing an editorial calendar. You can have a Trello board example, «Editorial Calendar.» Inside this board, you could have lists like «Ideas,» «In Progress,» «Review,» and «Published.» Each card could represent a specific article and move across these lists as it progresses through these stages.

Trello Organization
Effective Trello organization ideas are at the heart of using this tool proficiently. It is what turns Trello from a simple task-tracking application to a powerful project management tool. Here are some Trello tips and best practices to help you get the most out of this tool.
Trello Board Ideas
Begin by defining the purpose of the Trello board clearly. Make sure your board's name reflects its purpose. Using descriptive board names helps keep things organized and aids in navigation. For instance, instead of naming a board «Marketing,» a more descriptive name could be «Marketing — Q3 Campaigns.»
Ensure that your lists reflect the flow of your project or work. Typically, tasks move from left to right, representing their progress. Make sure your list names and order reflect this flow.
Lastly, use labels effectively. Labels in Trello can be used to signify task types, priority levels, or any other categorization that suits your project.
Trello Organize Boards
One crucial aspect of Trello organization is the effective organization of boards. Keeping you organized is essential, especially if you have multiple boards for different projects. Trello provides a «collections» feature for group-related boards.
For instance, you can have a collection named «Marketing» and have all your marketing-related boards in that collection. This feature is a great way to organize your Trello boards and improves navigation, especially when dealing with multiple boards.
Trello Organizing Tips
When it comes to Trello organizing, the opportunities are practically endless. Here are some additional tips:
1.	Use the Checklist feature to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Each checklist item can be ticked off, showing progress in real-time.
2.	Attach files directly to cards to keep all relevant information in one place. You can attach files from your computer, Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive.
3.	Utilize Power-Ups to extend Trello's functionality. Power-Ups are third-party integrations that can add various features, such as calendar views, automated actions, advanced reporting, and more.
4.	Utilize each card's comments and activity feed to foster collaboration and communication within your team.
5.	Ensure you archive completed cards to keep your board clean and focused on active tasks. Archived cards can be accessed later if needed.

The Wobbly timer can be set to start as soon as you begin working on a Trello card. This is achieved by integrating Wobbly with Trello. Once you move a card to the 'In Progress list, the Wobbly timer automatically kicks in and starts tracking your time spent on the task. This is an excellent way to ensure accurate time tracking and saves you the trouble of manually starting and stopping timers.

Project Management,"Trello Software
Trello is easy-to-use, highly visual software with Kanban boards and cards for organizing to-do lists. It has quickly became a popular productivity and project management software solution for all types of users. In this Trello review, we’ll go over the software’s features and strengths, so you can decide whether this tool is a good fit for your organization.
What Is Trello?
Trello is a collaboration workspace tool for users to manage all kinds of work happening across teams, businesses, and locations. Users create Trello cards to represent tasks, and these are organized on a Trello board with a drag-and-drop interface. This Kanban board-style view remains core to the project management software’s free version and Standard plan, but Trello provides additional views and features for Premium and Enterprise subscribers.
Trello : Features and Strengths
Multiple Views
Trello provides an easy-to-use, cloud-based digital workspace tool that supports task visibility. With the Standard plan and free version, an interactive Kanban Board view lets you organize cards, adding or adjusting start and end dates quickly, or grouping cards in lanes. The tool’s users can organize cards by list, label, or member to display workload or task dependencies. In higher-tier paid plans, Trello features additional views to give teams more perspectives on their project across different phases. For instance, the Timeline view lets Trello users see how all the moving parts of a project fit together over time.
For projects that span across boards, teams can use the Table view to provide a convenient, spreadsheet-style list that they can sort and filter. The Dashboard view shows team progress and gives insights into how teams perform. The Calendar view shows a monthly perspective of project management and provides an easy way to change start and due dates with drag and drop. Finally, the Map view organizes locations on cards and visualizes that information on a map with one click.
Smart, Connected Cards
Trello cards represent work or tasks within the tool that users can sort, label, and move across different project management stages. Each card can be clicked on to display task descriptions, comments, and an activity feed. Users can perform different functions such as adding members, checklists, due dates, and file attachments. You can also link cards by pasting a PMCOM as a card title. Cards can also display previews from other apps such as Google Drive, YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox, Stripe, and Salesforce, among others.
AI and Integration
Trello syncs all information across devices, whether via desktop, tablet, or mobile apps. The AI chatbot Butler provides built-in workflow automation for simple projects and repetitive tasks, helping teams save time and effort as they assign tasks. Power-Ups provide third-party app integration to tools that teams are already using.
Email integration allows users to create task cards and add comments from their inbox. Users can also use @mentions and emojis to liven up discussions. A free, public developer API is also available with the software. Enterprise plans offer more advanced features and integration controls to the tool.
Trello Pricing
Trello offers four pricing tiers, depending on the individual’s or company’s needs.
•	Trello Free: The free version is free forever, but limited to 10 team boards. Includes unlimited Power-Ups, 250 workspace command runs per month, file attachments of up to 10 MB per file, data exports in JSON format, and workspace customizations.
•	Trello Standard: Plan is $60 per user per year. Includes unlimited boards, unlimited Power-Ups, 1000 workspace command runs per month, file attachments of up to 250 MB per file, data exports in JSON format, workspace customizations, advanced checklists, saved searches, and custom fields.
•	Trello Premium: Plan is $119.99 per user per year. Includes all the features of Standard, as well as unlimited workspace command runs per month, data exports in JSON and CSV formats, admin and security features, additional views (Table, Timeline, Dashboard, Calendar, and Map), workspace board templates, and priority support.
•	Trello Enterprise: Contact the sales team for rates, but pricing varies with the number of licenses. Includes all the features of Standard and Premium, additional admin controls over Power-Ups and attachments, organization-wide permissions and visible boards, and public board management.
Who Uses Trello?
Trello is ideal for individuals, teams, and businesses of all sizes looking for a highly visual and intuitive task management and project management solution. Clients include Adobe, Kickstarter, National Geographic, Google, and Fender.
Trello Supported Languages
Trello software supports English, Portuguese, French, Spanish, German, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Czech, Dutch, Italian, Turkish, Thai, Japanese, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and Vietnamese.
Case Studies
Nathan Sichilongo described Trello as an easy-to-use to-do list and project management software. The intuitive design makes it easy to get started. The cards and lists allow him to go in-depth with project planning, and the features enable him to manage multiple projects in different ways.
Katie Doryland stated that Trello is the perfect project management tool. She loves how easy it is to use the software. Trello helps her company’s different teams and graphic designers keep track of the progress of different tasks and projects.
Why Choose Trello?
Trello is a highly visual and simple-to-use general task manager and project management tool. It is intuitive, requires minimal training, and comes with automation features that can boost the productivity of any team, remote or otherwise. The platform encourages team collaboration and is ready for integration with Power-Ups. It also has mobile apps that provide work flexibility.
That said, Trello’s simplicity means it’s ill-suited to technical or complex projects. It’s a good fit for individuals and teams looking for task management, but lacks the bells and whistles of more robust solutions. Multiple views are only available in higher pricing tiers, with prices comparable to more extensive project management software. Still, Trello remains particularly popular with small teams for its user-friendly, clever design and free version.
Company Info
Trello began as a privately held software company based in New York. Originally an internal project management tool, Trello launched in 2011 with a web and iOS app. After a year, it had reached 500,000 members. In 2014, it spun off as Trello, Inc. and received over $10 million in investment capital with more than 4 million members. In 2017, Atlassian acquired Trello. Its purpose is to provide a visual collaboration tool that helps individuals and teams organize work in a fun, flexible way.",Trello
Project Management,"The Pros and Cons of using Trello Software
Because of the many advantages users have experienced when using Trello, this online project management software has become popular. As a tool for project management, it gives its users the power to collaborate with their members and run tasks related to their projects without switching from one app to another. With just one look, users can see the tasks, who they are assigned to, and what has already been done to them. Moving these tasks around the platform is straightforward and indicates the project’s progress.
Because Trello makes the team’s work a lot easier, it utilizes boards, lists, and cards that can be manipulated to utilize and prioritize projects flexibly. Each of these tools serves a specific purpose, with the boards presenting the projects and their information, the lists having the titles, and the cards serving as the basic unit of work in Trello. To show the progress of the project and the individual tasks, users have the option to move the lists to the appropriate boards and choose to store the finished tasks in the cloud or their profile.
The Cons or Disadvantages of Trello
1.	Limited advanced features: Trello lacks some advanced project management features, such as time tracking, Gantt charts, and built-in reporting tools, which can be crucial for more complex projects.
2.	Scalability issues: Trello may not be the best choice for large organizations or teams with numerous projects, as its simplicity can hinder managing a high volume of tasks and team members.
3.	Over-reliance on third-party integrations: To access additional functionality, users often need to rely on third-party integrations, which may lead to potential compatibility issues or added costs.
4.	Limited customization options: While Trello’s simplicity is part of its appeal, it can also be restrictive for teams that require more customization options to adapt the software to their specific needs and workflows.
5.	Security concerns: Some users may have concerns about data privacy and security, as Trello is a cloud-based solution and sensitive information is stored on external servers. This may not be ideal for organizations with strict security protocols or those handling sensitive data.
6.	The steeper learning curve for non-technical users: Although Trello is designed to be user-friendly, its extensive use of boards, lists, and cards may initially be overwhelming for non-technical users or those unfamiliar with Kanban-style project management.
7.	Limited offline functionality: As a primarily web-based tool, Trello’s offline functionality is limited, which can be problematic for users who need to access and manage their projects in areas with unreliable internet connectivity.
8.	Potential for information overload: Trello’s visual nature and the ability to add extensive details to cards can sometimes lead to information overload, making it difficult for team members to identify and focus on high-priority tasks amidst the clutter quickly.
The Pros or Advantages of Trello
Here are some of the many advantages of using this software.
1.	Trello uses real-time. Members can work on the projects without causing any disruption to the updates. Once an update is made to the system, it shows automatically without delay.
2.	Adding members is easy. A user can add a new member by simply putting in the new user’s email address, and it’s done.
3.	Responsive design. The software will show without issue whether one accesses Trello from a laptop computer, smartphone, or tablet. This means that if a user accesses it from a different device than he usually uses, say a laptop, he will still be able to use Trello.
4.	It features the Kanban system. Many other software uses the Kanban system developed by Toyota in the 1950s. Because of this system, it is now much easier for users to create tasks for projects and break these down into even smaller tasks by using its boards.
5.	The notification system is superb. This is one of the strongest features of Trello because every move made on the software can be seen. An email notification is sent for every update, a comment made, and a task removed, while a push notification goes to phone users.
6.	Uncomplicated Pricing plan. This is another feature of Trello that makes it great software. Users can subscribe to its unlimited access package for only $25, which already allows an unlimited number of users and access to a wide assortment of features.
7.	No need for notes. Not only is Trello useful, but it is also environment-friendly because it helps users get rid of writing notes. They can make these notes on the software and never worry again about forgetting their tasks.
8.	User-friendly. Anybody can use Trello because it has been designed to be simple and easy. At one glance, it is easy to see how the software can be managed in a way that even a beginner can understand.
What is Trello?
With Trello’s numerous uses, we have come up with the most essential in the list below.
1.	Tracking one’s time. The most common notion about time tracking pertains to charging by the hour. Trello does more than that and helps increase the members’ productivity.
2.	Planning a vacation. As Trello does wonders, it can also help make planning a vacation easy by allowing users to create lists of their daily activities.
3.	Organize daily activities. Trello helps users keep track of their daily tasks using just one platform. Thanks to the software’s very visual nature, these tasks contain lists without making checking and updating confusing.
4.	Organizing a reading list. The software is not just limited to businesses, as it can also be used for making a personal list of reading materials. It is helpful for keeping track of a growing list of books and magazines worth reading.
5.	Running a budget. Trello can also be used for tracking personal expenses and income. Different cards can contain income and expense lists to help the user better control his finances.
6.	Managing a project or team. This is perhaps the most popular use of Trello, which allows managers to oversee a project and create boards for specific members that contain their tasks.
Trello Pricing & Costs
Trello offers a straightforward pricing structure, facilitating an easy selection of the most suitable plan for your requirements. There are four pricing plans available from Trello, which are as follows:
	Trello Free – a solid option for those just starting, offering better value than some other free plans
	Trello Standard ($5 per user, per month) – suitable for small businesses on a budget that requires more features than the free plan
	Trello Premium ($10 per user, per month) – ideal for growing businesses, offering most of the essential project management features
	Trello Enterprise ($17.50 per user, per month) – perfect for larger companies, but may be overkill for teams smaller than 100.

Is Trello Secure? (Encryption, infrastructure, authentication and more)
Trello prioritizes the security of its users’ data. Here are some key aspects of Trello’s security measures that help ensure the safety of its platform:
1.	Data encryption: Trello encrypts data both in transit and at rest. Data transmitted between users and Trello’s servers is secured using Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption. Additionally, data at rest is encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 256-bit key length.
2.	Infrastructure: Trello’s infrastructure is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides a secure and robust environment. AWS complies with a wide range of security standards and certifications, such as SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3, and ISO 27001, ensuring a high level of security for Trello’s data storage and processing.
3.	Access control: Trello offers granular access controls that allow users to manage who has access to their boards, lists, and cards. Users can make their boards public or private and invite specific team members to collaborate on projects. Trello uses a role-based access control system to grant different levels of permissions to users, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access and modify data.
4.	Authentication: Trello supports strong authentication methods, such as single sign-on (SSO) and two-factor authentication (2FA). These authentication methods help protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Trello’s user-friendly interface and visual nature make it an attractive project management software for businesses and individuals. However, it is essential to consider its limitations regarding advanced features and scalability for larger organizations. Trello excels in streamlining workflows, boosting collaboration, and providing a clear overview of project progress, but may fall short for teams requiring more robust or customizable solutions.
Ultimately, the decision to use Trello should be based on one’s unique project management needs, considering both the software’s advantages and disadvantages. As with any tool, thoroughly evaluating Trello’s suitability for your specific context will ensure you make an informed choice that best serves your team’s objectives.",Trello
Project Management,"Trello: The Good and The Bad
As much as we love Trello, it doesn’t come without its drawbacks. In this section, we explore our favorite—and least favorite—qualities that Trello has to offer.
What Trello Is Good At
Easy to use: Trello’s usability is one of the biggest reasons we (and a lot of other folks) love it. It’s as intuitive as it gets, making a great solution for smaller teams looking for a no-brainer solution. Even non-technical users can navigate the platform without hassle—it’s familiar and simple yet powerful enough to keep your team organized for years to come.
From starting a new project to onboarding new team members, everything takes just a few clicks. Since simplicity is at Trello’s core, there’s virtually no learning curve. You can sign up now and be managing your next project in less than five minutes. It’s that easy.
Workflow automation: Despite its simplicity, Trello’s automation tools are generous and just as easy to set up. Butler, Trello’s automation bot, makes setting up rule-based triggers and desired actions easier than ever. All you have to do is answer a few questions and Butler configures everything for you. From due-date commands, moving cards from one column to the next, and notifying team members, it offers just enough to help you save time and get more done without worrying about admin tasks.
Custom buttons: We used these a lot. You can set them up to take specific actions when they’re clicked. We used them to automatically move cards from one column to the next and assign new team members after an item was marked as done. We never had to worry about remembering to tag the next person, making it a worry-free solution for our team.
Extended functionality options: Out of the box, it’s easy to use with virtually no learning curve. But there are numerous ways to extend its capabilities. From Butler automations to Power-Ups and integrations, it offers just the right amount of power without sacrificing its claim to fame.
With Power-Ups, you can integrate tools you’re already using, like Slack, Google Drive, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams, into your Trello workflows to create automations that span all of your tools. Inside Trello, you’ll find Power-Ups for file management, communication, analytics and reporting, and more. These extended capabilities help take a basic Trello board to the next level.
Integrations: We briefly touched on integrations above, but there are so many it deserves it’s own call out. There are hundreds of one-click connectors that make syncing your systems easier than ever. From file management and marketing to sales, analytics, and collaboration tools, there’s no shortage.
Strong Slack Integration: Speaking of integrations, Trello’s Slack integration is one we used just about every day. With it, you can paste Trello links into Slack and see important stats, like assignees, task descriptions, and recent comments without ever leaving the app. You can even attach Slack conversations directly to Trello cards, change due dates ,and invite users to boards or cards directly within Slack.
This integration really makes life easier for employees as they can choose how to interact with Trello in a way that works best for them. They’re not forced to bounce back and forth between two platforms if they don’t want to.
Powerful mobile app: Most of the best project management solutions come with some version of a mobile app, but Trello’s is a highly-rated fan favorite. With it, you can do just about everything you can do on the desktop version, distilling project management down into just a few taps. It’s super easy to drag cards from one column to another without messing up the workflow or moving something by mistake. These are common pain points for other Kanban-style project management apps on the market, but it’s not a problem for Trello.
Team collaboration: Team collaboration is at the heart of the project management process and Trello doesn’t fail to deliver. It comes with a wide range of collaboration options, including comments, document sharing, @mentions of teammates, and notifications as well. Managers can assign team members to the appropriate cards so users always know what’s on their agenda.
Plus, users can comment on cards, tag each other, and keep conversations centralized to each task so everything stays in one place. Each user can also configure notifications via email, desktop, and push to customize the experience based on their preferences.
Checklists: These are one of our favorite features of Trello–so much so that these alone are what made us able to stick with it for so long, even as our team grew. Each task in Trello exists as a card. But sometimes, those tasks need to be broken down further. Enter… checklists. You can assign items to different users and give them each their own due date, allowing you to get really granular if you want to. Because of this, we included Trello on our list of the best task management software, too.
Great value: While some project management tools cost a lot and don’t deliver, Trello takes the opposite approach—it’s affordable yet delivers a lot of bank for your buck. Even if you have no budget, there’s a free-forever plan that comes with unlimited cards and lists as well as up to ten boards per team. You can invite your whole team and use it for free, as long as you have fewer than ten boards.
Many businesses stay on the free plan forever because it comes with more than enough. But if you ever need to upgrade, paid plans start at just $5 per user and include unlimited storage, custom fields, and advanced checklists. Simply put, you get a ton of value regardless of the plan you’re on.
Great if you use other Atlassian products: For larger teams that are currently using or planning to use other Atlassian cloud products, like Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Jira Work Management, Confluence, or Statuspage, Trello will fit seamlessly alongside them.
While this isn’t a Trello-specific feature, you can add an Atlassian Access subscription to your plan. This is an enterprise-grade security feature that includes SAML single sign-on and two-factor authentication. For just $4 per user per month, you can get identity and access management tools from a centralized admin console for Trello and all of your Atlassian products.
Unmatched versatility: Trello is best known for its project management features. But beyond that, it can be used for dozens of other potential use cases. It’s flexible enough to manage editorial calendars (we used it this way), brainstorm new ideas, track and stay up-to-date with team meetings, and track tasks. You can use Trello as an internal resource hub, event management, tracking and managing clients, and so much more.
While the vast majority of people using Trello rely on it for business and work-related purposes, it’s even versatile enough for personal use cases. It works really well for staying organized for things like planning a wedding, staying on top of homework, or getting ready for a family reunion. This is definitely an area where Trello shines over other project management tools that are strictly for business use.
Perfect for beginners: For solo users or managing simple projects with small teams, Trello is an easy choice. It’s incredibly easy to set up, and there’s virtually no learning curve—even if you have no prior experience with project management tools.
If you’ve outgrown spreadsheets and unorganized to-do lists for your managing tasks, you can sign up for Trello and move all of your tasks there in less than an hour. It’s even a simple way for individuals to separate work-related tasks from what needs to get done in their personal lives.
What Trello Is Lacking
Limited project views: Trello is known for its Kanban boards, making it an excellent option for Kanban project management. Beyond that, Trello’s other project views are fairly limited to similar project management solutions at the same price point.
This is especially true with the entry-level plans, where Kanban is the only view available. This is fine for simple, linear projects that don’t have lots of moving parts. But it’s not ideal for projects that need more granular insights.
Basic reporting: Unlike other project management tools on the market, Trello does not offer reporting and analytics out-of-the-box. Project managers won’t have the luxury of seeing how their team is performing or getting actionable insights related to the big picture. Trello does offer reporting tools through Power-Ups, but that’s not quite the same as a project management solution within built-in reporting. Won’t work for complex projects: Trello is great for project visualization and task management through tasks that go through a linear projection. But it lacks features to meet the needs of agile teams that use project management software for daily workflows.
For example, you can’t attach tasks to subtasks, create roadmaps, or review iterations. Trello probably isn’t the best option for complex projects, agile teams, and software developers. (If you need a package that is better at complex projects, check out our breakdown of the best Trello alternatives.)
Lots of paid add-ons: While we like the ability to extend Trello’s capabilities with Power-Ups, it’s worth noting that most of these extensions will cost extra. You won’t necessarily need to add Power-Ups to get the most out of Trello. But if you’re considering these perks while you’re evaluating the tool, just be aware that they’ll add to your total cost.
Hard to track multiple projects simultaneously: Trello does a great job of organizing each project into its own board. But for those of you who are working on multiple boards at once, it’s not easy to see the status of everything in one place. You do have the option to track all of the cards that you’ve been assigned across all boards. But this isn’t quite the same as seeing a bird’s-eye view of each project or seeing what’s in the pipeline prior to getting assigned to you.
Limited support: If you’re on a free Trello plan, you’ll need to rely strictly on community forums for support. This isn’t ideal, but it’s tough to complain if you’re not paying anything. However, even Trello’s paid plans don’t come with the highest level of support.
At the Standard tier, support is only available during local business hours. You’ll get 24 hours of support at the Premium tier, but it’s only five days per week. 24/7 support isn’t unlocked until you reach the Enterprise level—which most Trello users aren’t on. While the limited support isn’t a deal breaker, it could be a pain if you need help doing something after hours or over the weekend.
No native time tracking: Tracking time spent on tasks and projects is crucial for managing resources, human capital, project planning, billing, and so much more. Unfortunately, Trello doesn’t provide any built-in time-tracking function. You’ll get this with other Atlassian products, like Jira Software, but not with Trello. You’ll need to use Trello power-ups to add time-tracking functionality to cards, so it’s still possible to achieve what you’re looking for. But this isn’t quite the same as having it as a built-in function.
Limited admin features: Compared to other project management tools on the market, Trello’s administrative features are definitely lacking and somewhat non-existent at certain plan tiers. You’ll have control over the basics—like adding or removing users, converting guests to team members, managing workspace information, and setting boards to public or private.
You won’t get any roles or permission management settings until you reach the Premium tier. Organization-wide permissions aren’t available unless you’re on an Enterprise plan. At the Enterprise level, you get some additional admin features unlocked in the form of a power-up. But overall, you don’t have a ton of administrative control.
Trello Pricing and Options
Trello is a single-product solution for project management. There are four base plans, with various add-ons that can be used to extend the capabilities of your plan. We’ll take a closer look at Trello’s pricing and the specifics of each plan in greater detail below.
Trello Pricing
As previously stated, Trello is one of the most affordable project management tools on the market today. There’s even a free plan for basic use. However, the paid options deliver tremendous value for teams of all sizes. Trello Free
The free plan is great for personal use and small side projects. It comes with unlimited cards, unlimited lists, and 10 MB per file attachment. This package only supports up to ten boards per team, but that’s usually more than enough for personal use. You also get unlimited Power-Ups per board. That means you can test drive Trello to its fullest extent or even stay on the free plan if your operation is small enough.
Surprisingly, the free plan does support automation. Most project management tools don’t offer automated functionality at a free level, so it’s nice to see that Trello does.
You can run up to 250 commands per month with this automation feature.
Compared to alternatives on the market, Trello’s free plan is arguably the best one. But it is a bit limiting beyond personal use. For business use and teams larger than just a few people, you’ll definitely want to upgrade to a paid package.
You can try one of Trello’s paid packages for free with a 14-day trial. It’s also worth noting that Trello offers discounts for educational institutions and nonprofit organizations. So if you fall into one of those categories, contact Trello for custom discounted pricing. Trello Standard
Trello Standard is the platform’s entry-level paid pricing tier. It’s the most popular product offering from this provider. With a rate of $5 per user per month, it’s still a bargain and a great value for teams of all sizes.
If you have 10, 20, or 30+ team members, you’ll definitely want to upgrade to this package. It’s also a great option for organizations with several departments that need to manage multiple projects simultaneously. While the free package only supports up to ten boards per team, Trello Business Class offers unlimited boards. This product comes standard with advanced features and Power-Ups, including custom fields, calendar and map views, advanced checklists, list limits, card repeaters, voting, and over 100 app integrations. It also includes all the basics found in the free tier.
You can create custom fields with Trello’s Standard tier, which is great for businesses that have some specific needs. Customers can store as many files as they want with their accounts, although you have a file size limit of 250 MB per file.
Should you need to give guests access to your Trello board, you can do this in the Standard tier. However, guests will have a limit of using one board within your Trello setup. This can be a great feature if you use freelancers or have clients who need to see a particular board.
If you want to get the most out of Trello’s automation capabilities, you’ll need a Trello Business Class subscription. There are still some restrictions, but it’s more than enough for most teams. You’ll get up to 1,000 command runs per month. Teams of less than 100 running straightforward projects won’t come anywhere near these limits. Overall, if you’re comparing Trello’s Standard plan with other Kanban-style project management tools for less complex projects, this is the industry leader. If you’re planning on using Trello beyond personal use for a side project, go with Trello Standard. This will help put you and your team in a position to succeed. Trello Premium
Trello Premium soups up the features and capability of Trello’s Standard plan. Great for larger teams whom an enterprise-grade solution is overkill, Premium first and foremost takes the restrictions off of automations.
You’re allowed unlimited command runs, meaning you can fine-tune your project management platform to run like a well-oiled machine.
Customizing and stretching the Trello platform to your needs is the name of the game on this package. The Premium tier unlocks additional project views, including:
•	Dashboard
•	Timeline
•	Table
•	Calendar
•	Map
•	Workspace Table
•	Workspace Calendar
This helps give you and your team a bird’s-eye view of progress from any angle.
You can also create template boards that help you map good, tested processes to other departments or new projects.
The ability to add “observers” to your board is also a nice feature to have. This gives people access to projects but limit their actions within a board, which is useful for cross-department projects or collaboration with parties outside of your organization.
Simply, for $10 per user per month, you get to shape the Trello platform into the form that best suits your company with no limitations. Plus, you’ll benefit from priority support and many other sweet features.
Try it for free by signing up for a 14-day trial.
Trello Enterprise
Trello Enterprise is the top-of-the-line product offering from this provider. It’s designed for larger teams of 50 or more users with advanced needs for project management. The software starts at $17.50 per user per month, but Trello offers volume discounts for larger teams with more than 250 users. For example, the per-user rate drops to $16.25 per month at 500 users and goes all the way down to $7.38 for 5,000 users. It’s worth noting that Trello Enterprise doesn’t necessarily accommodate more advanced projects. The software simply adds functionality to simple projects on a larger scale. This is especially true for automation. With Trello Enterprise, you’ll benefit from unlimited command runs across your entire team.

Project Management,"What Is Asana?
Asana is similar to other task and project management software which allow teams to organize, collaborate, plan, and execute tasks. It acts as a perfect companion to overcome chaos and meet deadlines. It is a web-based task management and collaboration tool which eliminates the email mess and brings all tasks together. Teams can use Asana to keep track of all tasks, collaborate with other team members, exchange related files, and more.
The tool is widely used by various famous companies like Deloitte, Airbnb, Pinterest, and Dropbox. Asana is becoming a favorite among industry giants due to its numerous project management and collaboration features. It is used by millions of individuals in 195 countries and is expanding globally. Asana for Project Management: How Does It Work?
Individuals and teams can use Asana to break down large work into manageable tasks. It's a comprehensive work management tool that allows you to track project and task progress, share files, comments, and notes, and keep track of deadlines. It is a modern method of working together in collaboration. Asana, as already mentioned above, is a task management software that has certain features like projects, workspaces, tasks, and sections to manage projects and tasks related to several clients and teams. Asana is mainly designed for teams to spend less time writing emails, meetings, and working on the assigned tasks. The Asana project management tool helps its users to work faster and take on interesting goals. Workspaces
Workspaces are nothing but shared work areas where users can collaborate on tasks and projects. These are the primary building blocks of your Asana tool. You can create different workspaces for different clients or teams separately.
Projects
After workspaces, you will get a space where you can see a series of projects. They are your organization's main units, which can be both private and public. You can color-code them and filter them in your project section based on tags, assigned people, and priority.
Tasks
This level of work organization in Asana is to-dos. You may create tasks, fill them with a variety of information, and keep your workload balanced.
Calendar
The calendar section in Asana allows you to view all your pending tasks. You can quickly switch between 'list view' and 'calendar view' on the Asana calendar to see which tasks are due and when.
Even though Asana includes capabilities that provide everything you need to stay in sync, some teams are looking for Asana alternatives since Asana project management has failed to become the ultimate solution due to its pricing and a variety of other valid reasons.
Asana Features
Communication Tools
Your inbox helps in tracking all your messages and their associated tasks. You can even attach tasks to messages and use project conversations to continue ongoing discussions. You may also proof photographs and PDFs, and any comments you make can be turned into tasks, so the rest of the team knows what needs to be fixed.
Different Ways To View Work
As Asana is mainly designed to adapt to your workforce, it provides various ways to view your tasks and projects:
List: View and group your tasks in a grid format.
My tasks: Here, you can see all your tasks in a to-do list format.
Calendar: It shows a list of tasks to be completed within a deadline.
Board: It shows your upcoming tasks in a bulletin board-style format.
Inbox: It contains a list of your conversations.
Files: Groups together all the files that are uploaded to the project.
Management and Reporting Tools
If you are a manager of your team, reporting tools of Asana will make it easier for you to keep project updates organized and send update reminders when needed. You can also set “goals” to keep everyone on the same page and “milestones” to motivate and encourage their hard work.
You can also use status updates for projects and portfolios to swiftly communicate with your team and use your Dashboard to see the status of all active projects and tasks at a glance and identify issue areas if necessary.
Creating teams will allow you to group people together to work on a single project. The team section comprises an overview tab where you can track projects and a messages tab for announcements and group conversations. You can add teammates as followers to projects that aren't allocated to them to keep them updated and alert them if there are any issues that they can help with. Administrators have privacy controls. You can use permissions and other privacy measures to restrict access to specific tasks or even hide some teams that perform sensitive work.
Easy App Integration
Asana's app integration is one of the features that makes it simple to use. Several other apps also function well with Asana, the most notable ones being-
Power BI, Microsoft Team, Zoom, Outlook, Gmail, and Slack for Communication.
Adobe Creative Cloud, OneDrive, Office365, Box, Google Drive, and Dropbox for file creation and sharing.
Harvest, which is an in-built time tracker tool.
Asana for Project Management: Pros and Cons
Pros
The following are the pros of Asana:
The design of the interface of Asana is attractive
An easy to use calendar synced with all of your tasks
Possible to view your personal tasks in a single place
Email integration Cons
The following are the cons of Asana:
There is no simple method to keep track of all items across several projects that are due on the same day or week.
Since this application is mainly text-based, it's common for the structure to be broken, a job to be removed, or the task's name to be changed.
It does not allow you to assign multiple people to the same task.
With so many duties in one location, the process might get slow.
Because Asana lacks time-tracking capabilities, you'll need to use an external time-tracking program.
Conclusion
Asana is a flexible workplace content management system (CMS) that can be tailored to meet the demands of a wide range of businesses. It is a sophisticated project management tool. To use this tool seamlessly and master its working, you can enroll in Simplilearn’s Post Graduate Program in Project Management course that covers strategizing and management - project, program, risk, quality, complexity management, customer-centric digital transformation, PMO implementation, and agile and scrum skills.",Asana
Project Management,"What is Asana?
Asana is a work management tool. Some will speak of Asana as a project management tool or a task manager. And they are not wrong. But if you are using Asana simply to manage individual projects or keep a detailed to-do list, you are missing out on some important pieces of the equation. As a work management tool, Asana coordinates all work on your plate, pulls together specific projects and processes, and allows them to live in a single place giving you a single source of truth and next actions for you and everyone you work alongside. When running a business, a work management tool is absolutely necessary.
Why use Asana?
Recent studies show that knowledge workers, those who spend their days handling information, spend close to 60% of their time on work about work. So what is work about work? That would be the things you do before doing the actual work you should be doing to grow your business. This could be looking through email, searching for documents, looking for status updates about projects, scanning spreadsheets for information, or asking questions of a team member.
Of course, this means that the actual work that moves a business forward – strategic planning, creating, marketing, selling – gets only 40 percent of the time in your day. This begs the question. How can I personally organize my work so that I can flip the script and move the numbers even higher? Perhaps even shooting for 80% of my work being this actual work that moves the needle and 20% of it being work about work. Researchers have also found that for the average worker, 3 working weeks per year are spent on duplicated work.
3 working weeks per year are spent on unnecessary calls and meetings.
This means that 6 weeks of your year could be recovered if processes were improved.
Perhaps you look at this research and wholeheartedly agree. But you just don’t know how to get around the facts and make a change to how you manage your workload. That’s where Asana comes in.
The Vital Link
There are two very important pieces of the puzzle that all businesses much have in order to function and grow. Documentation
One is a place to create, maintain, and store all documentation that the business needs to survive. For most businesses in the 21st century, this typically means a cloud-based drive such as Google Drive. It’s a place where documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and videos live until they are needed. Communication
The second large piece of the puzzle is a way to communicate with your team members and your clients about the work. For most businesses, this is typically email or perhaps Slack or another messaging system.
It’s important to note that using Asana will not eliminate or replace either of these essential pieces. Instead, Asana links these essential pieces together to form a smooth and streamlined platform to manage all your work.
Perhaps you have experienced what I have when working with a cloud-based drive. I find that the drive quickly becomes a huge mess of unorganized files. A dumping ground of sorts. In my experience, if you are lucky and persistent or both, you might be able to search for a document that you know is in there somewhere. Or perhaps you have your own personal organizational system to find the documents that you need the most. However, your disorganized teammate can never find what they need and you spend your valuable time helping them find the needed documents. Does this scenario sound familiar? When your teammate needs to collaborate, you receive an email with questions or information about the work with a couple of others cc’d. That email soon becomes an email thread that is hard to follow as the work progresses. At some point, someone on the email thread sends a Slack message related to the joint work. So you are tracking conversations in two places. Keeping up with the conversation about the work quickly goes off track.
One place for all pieces
Both a place for documents to live and a place to communicate about your work are essential to running a successful business. Asana streamlines your work by acting as a link between both of these pieces. When you use Asana to link each piece of your work together, you will add documents (or links to them) right on the projects and tasks in Asana. In addition, Asana gives you a place directly on the tasks to ask questions, provide comments, link to other work, and even celebrate when the work is complete. This means that you have everything you need to complete the work in one place. And you have a history of how and when the work was completed. Everyone involved in the work has direct access to this information, providing a clear and transparent view of where the work stands.
Top 6 Reasons real users choose Asana
As we work with clients here at Tessera, we have found that there are many common reasons that teams choose to use Asana. Here are the top 6 from our clients.
Work is scattered in many places. Documentation and communication happen across many platforms, causing you to stop and start multiple times. You can never get into a good flow of work because you have to leave where you are to search for something you need.
People work in silos.
Silos may be great for Chip and Jo, but in a collaboration context, they can spell disaster. Workers are unsure of what other people are doing and if they are duplicating the work of others. Having a single source of “truth” for how the work is progressing eliminates the feeling of siloed work.
There is a lack of clarity on who is doing what by when.
This causes stress for the person who is ultimately responsible for the outcome. There is a lack of clarity on how my work relates to the full project.
Perhaps I have a few tasks to complete to move the full project forward. But I’m unsure how and where this fits into the full picture. Seeing the full body of work in Asana gives me that view.
Work is falling through the cracks.
Small pieces of work can easily be missed. Seeing the full scope and having my part assigned to me eliminates that possibility.
There is a need to streamline repeated work.
All businesses have processes, whether they are written out or in the head of the one who does that work. Once the process is written, it can easily be templated in Asana to cut the time needed to do the task and makes sure that it is done in a uniform way each time it is needed.",Asana
Project Management,"Asana is a workplace management dashboard that helps streamline communication across companies and teams. Asana is customizable, and allows users to break down projects into tasks and set clear goals for teams. Asana also has integration with hundreds of other apps that businesses use, like Google Drive and Outlook. Visit Insider's Tech Reference library for more stories. Asana is a customizable workplace content management system (CMS) which is designed to help a wide range of companies achieve their organizational needs. More plainly, it's an advanced organizational tool to help streamline projects. Asana is made so that workplaces of any size can analyze their progress and address issues all in one place, eliminating the need for constant meetings, email updates, and memos. What to know about Asana Asana has a wide range of features available to help companies and the teams within them find a system to get things done as efficiently as possible. These features include: Project and task management Asana's main feature is its project and task management tools. You can create lists or boards to host certain projects as a whole — these will detail all the initiatives, meetings, and programs involved in said projects. From there, you can break these projects into tasks and subtasks to make them more manageable, and list the steps to complete them. You can also: Give tasks to specific people so everyone knows who is working on what Group tasks into sections or columns to keep them organized Assign start dates and due dates, which can also include timed deadlines Create reusable templates to make certain tasks easier to start Add task dependencies to specify when some tasks need to be completed before others start View your tasks in a timeline so everyone can see the project chronologically Create rules to automate processes like assigning tasks and triaging Add attachments from a number of integrated software Communication tools Of course, one of the most important — and difficult — parts of teamwork is communication. Asana has tools to streamline this as well. Your Inbox tracks all your messages and their associated tasks. Here you can attach tasks to messages and use project conversations to have ongoing discussions. You can also proof images and PDFs, and any comments can even be turned into tasks so the team knows what corrections need to be made. Multiple ways to view work Because Asana is made to adapt to your workforce. As such, it offers several ways to view your projects and tasks: My tasks: A view that gives you a personal to-do list List: View and group your tasks in a grid structure Board: Displays your upcoming tasks in a bulletin board style format Calendar: Shows a list of tasks based on deadlines Files: Groups together all the files uploaded to project Inbox: Groups together all your conversations Management and reporting tools If you're in charge of an organization, Asana's reporting tools make it easy to keep project updates organized and send update reminders when necessary.

You can also craft status updates for projects and portfolios to send messages to your team quickly, and check your Dashboard to see the status of all ongoing projects and tasks at once, and identify problem areas if necessary. Creating Teams lets you group people together to collaborate on projects. The Team page includes an Overview tab to track projects, a Messages tab for group conversations and announcements, and a shared Calendar tab. You can add teammates as followers on tasks not assigned to them, to keep them updated and alert them if there are problems they can help with. Administrators also have privacy controls — you can add permissions and other privacy controls to limit access to certain work, or even keep some teams that do sensitive work hidden. Easy app integration
One of the things that makes Asana so easy to use is its app integration. There are a number of apps that work well with Asana, but the most notable are:
Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, Office365, OneDrive, and Adobe Creative Cloud for file creation and sharing
Slack, Gmail, Outlook, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Power BI for communication

Project Management,"What We Like About Asana (The Pros)
Intuitive, Easy Onboarding
Let’s make it clear, right off the bat, that no project management software could ever guarantee success. The human factor remains essential and yet rarely acknowledged in discussions of similar software.
You will still need to convince, encourage, and educate others to use Asana correctly. We’ve found that Asana is so intuitive, that onboarding was relatively easy among senior and new team members, for both in-house and outsourced tasks.
UX and UI
The first thing that users praise is the UX (User Experience) which is a direct result of the UI (User Interface) and an interesting lesson in design. The layout is spacious and clean, the color choices are cool and pastoral, the animations and transitions are gentle and relaxed.
Visually, Asana it manages to offer a compelling solution to the problem that has plagued management methodologies and software since they first appeared, namely, how to avoid making a series of intricately complex tasks seem overwhelming. I can’t think of a single team leader or project manager who would take this for granted; nothing sucks the energy and enthusiasm out of a person than when they are faced with a task that is presented in a way that feels overwhelming.
Preventing this overwhelming feeling in the UX is precisely where so many other project management tools fail (despite having great UI) and Asana lives up to its name; Asana is a Sanskrit word used to refer to a Yoga pose used to establish a firm and relaxed posture. (In Persian, Āsān means “easy to do” or “easy to learn”).
The ease of access to every variable of a task with a single click, in any view or display, is something that makes a project manager’s job of re-organizing objectives, re-assigning tasks and rescheduling deadlines, that much easier.
A Feast of Integrations
The amount of software suits, apps, and services that can integrate with Asana, is astounding.
So much so, that it would be a crime not to include this link to the impressively long list of app integrations with Asana.
Briefly overviewing the main integrations, I would have to include all the popular Microsoft, Adobe and Google tools. Asana also integrates with most of the first-rate digital marketing tools and resources such as MailChimp, Hubspot Workflows. Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, and CloudApp, among other cloud services, are also supported.
If you are outsourcing work to someone who prefers one of the rival project management tools, like Trello, Jira, or Zoho, et al., you needn’t worry. There are integrations for most of these too.
Asana is Customizable and Programmable
Asana has some delightful templates to choose from, though it shouldn’t stop you from getting creative and adding some personal touches to your workflow charts.
Beyond the visual customization, Asana is a Representational State Transfer (REST), or RESTful, app. Meaning that by redefining certain representations and operations, you can program Asana to shortcut tedious tasks, or perform repetitive sequences in a single click. You can also link certain tasks to create specific status reports, retrieve data from other sources, and more, to streamline your pipeline even further.
At Elementor we use Asana, and run the messaging and communications through Slack, using their own integration. The setup is slightly different in each department using it. For example, in the Content Department, we have projects set up so that they automatically require defining the content format (e.g. podcast, tutorial, article, news post, review, et.) and assign relevant tasks (e.g. research, writing, editing, video/sound editing, filming/recording, design, proofing, etc.,).
We also have conditions set so that if a task is completed, or if any changes have been made to the workflow, the affected stakeholders along the pipeline are alerted automatically. Asana also allows us to create tasks with multiple dependencies, preventing us from running ahead before all the essential elements are in place.
Basically, it works like a relay race, where an alert is set to pass the baton over to the next stakeholder as soon as the initial task is marked ‘completed’.
What’s Making Us Reconsider Using Asana (The Cons)
Duplication
Project duplication in Asana is a massive pain in the unmentionables. (There, I said it!)
Should you want to create a second similar task (e.g. a generic release pipeline, or another tutorial video) you need to duplicate it, then open the copy, and erase all the data from the template form. There are duplication options under ‘Project Actions’ on the Project page (to the right of the project title). But the options don’t appear for the tasks (there is an option to assign copies of tasks, but it is still convoluted)
Sure, you could create ready-to-use templates, mark them as such, and only copy them. But making each template takes time and, ironically, repetitive planning. Wouldn’t it be simpler to have the option of only duplicating a task template without the data?
A great example of simple task/project duplication can be found on ClickUp.
It’s Not for Everyone
As I mentioned earlier, it is extremely important to find the Project Managing app that works best for you, your service, your team, your output, and your clients.
This is why I truly appreciated reading comments from users, such as Ronny Hofsøy, who explained that he found Asana too task-oriented for his small business’ workflow. This forced him to find something more suitable (alternatives that he mentioned were SamePage.io, Timely, and ClickUp), despite having used Asana for quite a while.
Indeed, we had to consider the pros and cons for quite a while before making the move and committing ourselves, and everyone we work with, to using Asana.",Asana
Project Management,"What Asana Is Good At Feature-rich free plan: Many free plans for project management software lack the bells and whistles you need for success. But that’s not the case with Asana. In fact, of all the project management software we tested, Asana notches a spot at the top thanks to its free plan. Most other PM software’s free plans are so restrictive that they’re not functional for small businesses. But Asana doesn’t hold back—its free plan supports unlimited teams, projects, messaging, activity logs, file storage, multiple project views, and more. If you have less than 15 users and only need to manage basic projects, you’ll never need to upgrade and can stay on the free plan forever. You can even integrate Asana with your favorite time tracking tools without paying a penny. This is a rarity for PM software as most solutions charge extra for time tracking and don’t allow integrations on the free plan. Overall, Asana’s free plan is an absolute steal. Multiple project views: With Asana, users can view projects and manage tasks in several different ways, including Kanban boards, lists, calendars, portfolios, workloads, and timelines. Other project management tools on the market only offer one or two views, so it’s great to see that Asana gives you every option you’d ever need. A 2015 study presented at the Graphics Interface Conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada found that “tools need to be personalizable to accommodate…differences across individuals’ [project management] behaviors”. The study also found that project management tools that grow with your team are more likely to help you succeed. Asana meets these requirements for success with ease. Each team member can manage tasks in a way that works best for them, enabling them to be as productive as possible. Switching between views also gives project managers a big-picture perspective on where the project stands. And you can even create customizable project dashboards that update in real-time. You can customize them as you’d like to see the most important information at a glance. Process management automation: With Asana, you can automate those repetitive tasks and processes that drag your workflow down. The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) lists the benefits of automations. According to HIMSS, they help businesses save time and money while allowing employees to do more interesting work. And Asana makes it incredibly easy to do this. The workflow builder helps you set up custom rules, triggers, and actions. You can use it to set up basic automations. Think cascading due dates, assigning a task to the next person in the flow, checking a box, or alerting your team in Slack when a project is done. But Asana can handle even the most complex workflows that span dozens of users, tools, and tasks. Automating processes helps ensure things get done the right way while freeing up time for more important activities Team collaboration: Most of the project management tools we’ve tried don’t offer enough collaboration tools, causing us to look elsewhere for software to fill in the gaps. However, Asana is one of the few that can act as a single source of truth for file sharing PDFs, JPGs, Google docs, team communication, group communication, and more. This is especially helpful for organizations that have geographically distributed teams. One of the biggest challenges facing a workforce of remote employees is maintaining communication and fostering team collaboration. Asana also made our short list of recommended tools for keeping everyone on the same page, no matter where they are located. Users can assign tasks to team members, create task dependencies, assign priorities, set due dates, adjust due dates, and chat back and forth. This all occurs within a single, centralized task card. The calendar view lets teams plan around each others’ schedules and stay up to date on changes without needing to email back and forth. All project discussions and to-do lists are managed directly in Asana, too. Even better, the software integrates with popular email apps and third-party messaging tools. Agile and scrum support: If you’re a fan of agile project management, you’ll be glad to hear that Asana is flexible enough to support the philosophy. From sprint planning, bug tracking, product launches, work requests, roadmaps, feedback, and tracking task iterations, you get everything you need to match how you do work rather than the other way around. Countless PM tools on the market are too rigid and simply won’t work, but Asana is great whether you prefer a Kanban, Agile, or Scrum methodology, or something in between. Asana wants to make sure you succeed with Agile on its platform, too. Asana went so far as to create a glossary to help you match the terms Asana uses to standard Agile vocabulary. Asana also created a robust guide to help you set up your Agile projects within the platform. These efforts really simplify rolling out an Agile project management approach in Asana. Versatility: Asana is a flexible and adaptable project management software that works for many different management methodologies, business sizes, and industries. Furthermore, it’s a great choice for marketing, sales, product development, operations, human resources, IT, finance, and more. It’s an excellent tool if you plan to use it across multiple departments and to facilitate multi-departmental collaboration because it’s flexible enough for hundreds of different use cases. From event planners managing thousands of attendees to marketing teams managing dozens of campaigns across different channels and sales teams tracking leads through the pipeline, it’s versatile enough to work for just about everyone. Powerful integrations: Asana integrates with over 100 popular third-party apps like Slack, Dropbox, Google Drive, Zapier, Tableau, Zoom, and Salesforce. These integrations can really help extend the functionality of Asana. For example, your team can instantly be notified via Slack whenever a task or project is updated in Asana. It’s worth noting that some advanced integrations, like Salesforce and Tableau, are not available with every plan. Smart design: Thanks to the easy-to-understand layout for Asana’s dashboard, even newbies can quickly pick up the basics. Asana’s primary features are listed along the left side of the screen, so you always have access to them. Additionally, tabs across the top of the screen simplify navigation. If you want to display more information on the screen, you can temporarily hide the navigational features. Should your team have specific features you need to emphasize, you can customize the look of the dashboard. 50% off for nonprofits: You don’t have to pay full price if you’re registered as a nonprofit. A lot of software offers this, so it’s not anything special to Asana. But we love it and wanted to point it out all the same. What Asana Is Lacking Limited mobile app: Asana offers a free iOS and Android mobile app at every plan level. While the app is generally fine, it can be tough to use. Asana tends to work better on a full computer screen. The small screen on a mobile device just doesn’t do Asana justice. It’s difficult to get anything done beyond just quickly checking the status of a task. Can’t assign tasks to multiple users: Asana doesn’t allow project managers to assign tasks to more than one user. In theory, this is designed to make it clear exactly who is responsible for a particular task. You can add a task collaborator or use subtasks to bring multiple users into the loop. Asana also lets you create copies of tasks for other users. But at the end of the day, tasks will only have one main assignee. Email clutter: Many Asana users complain about the number of notification emails they get from Asana. Ultimately, you’ll have full control over your notification settings. So you can change that at any time. But it can be a bit annoying at first before you make those changes when your inbox is cluttered with Asana notifications. Fortunately, this is a simple fix. Limited time tracking: If you need to track the amount of time your team is spending on various aspects of projects for invoicing clients, Asana may not work for you. Asana provides time tracking features in its Business and Enterprise tiers. However, you do not have these features in the Basic or Premium tiers, meaning you must track time separately. Security: Although Asana recently added some impressive security features in its Enterprise tier, the other tiers aren’t as focused on security. In fact, if you are using the free Basic tier, Asana reserves the right to collect data about the way you are using Asana, including your mobile data. Asana Pricing and Options Asana Pricing Asana has a package for everyone. As previously mentioned, it has an exceptional free forever plan.",Asana
Project Management,"What is Asana?
Asana is a Saas (software as a service) platform that helps you manage your project and the team working on the project. You easily organize the project, prioritize tasks, collaborate with the team, and track progress. You manage your project from start to finish in one place. “Asana is powerful enough for any workflow but easy enough for any team to use.” That is what Asana claims, but does it stand true?

Is Asana Good for One Person?
Asana is a software or app is mostly for team management. A single individual will not find as much use for it.
The only use we found for a single person (sort of) is if only one person carries out a project - this individual’s work can be managed through Asana, although the functions might be limited.
For one-person tasks, the Friday Planner gives you all the functionality you need to organize and manage your tasks. Is Asana Good for Teams? Asana is excellent for teams. You can assign tasks to team members, set deadlines, track progress, approve/disapprove and comment on a completed task.
Asana Advantages and Disadvantages
As with anything, there are always some advantages and disadvantages when it comes to Asana. Here we list a few for you, so you don’t have to find out for yourself.
Pros: Where Asana excels
•	User experience : The user interface is easy to use - it is very intuitive. It also can color-code pretty much everything, so it is nicely and neatly organized and clear.
•	Work efficiency: It allows its users to see all the tasks at hand. This helps the team focus on what is urgent and schedule what may be less critical.
•	Integrations: Asana integrates well with other apps like Friday; please see below for more information and detail regarding this topic.
•	Free plan: Small groups and individuals may not have the financial resources to invest in costly project management software. Nonetheless, these technologies are critical to a company's success. Asana, fortunately, includes a free plan that lets organizations on a tight budget use the platform.
Cons: Where Asana lacks
•	One task, one person - You can’t assign multiple people to one single task - thankfully, the Friday integration helps with that.
•	Lack of Two-factor Authentication - This can be a security issue and potential drawback. The 2FA is used to prevent cyber attacks and security breaches, which can cause a lot of damage if you keep sensitive information in your Asana project management system.
•	Not very newbie-friendly - Asana is popular among experienced project managers. On the other hand, the technology can overwhelm novice users.",Asana

Cons or Disadvantages of Asana
Like any other technology tool, users need to analyze Asana’s pros and cons, then decide if its advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
Learning Curve
New users, especially non-technical users, are often overwhelmed with the number of features and options available when introduced to Asana. While this can usually be solved by training and onboarding, the front-end learning curve can also mean additional time and cost.
Beyond Basics
because teams have access to Asana’s advanced features and capabilities, the platform may be a mismatch for a small team whose projects are simpler or more limited in scope. Single Assignee for Tasks
Asana assigns a task to only one person to avoid confusion as to who is responsible. However, if the assigned person becomes unavailable, an additional workaround is necessary to keep the work going forward.
No Time Tracking
Asana is a powerful tool for tracking projects, tasks, and assignees. However, it does not have a built-in time tracking feature. Users need to find other time tracking apps and integrate them with Asana to have the ability to track time. This lack becomes an issue when projects involve billing clients, or when team members need to track time against internal budgets. Limited Exporting Functionality
Asana lets users export data in CSV and JSON formats only. Users cannot export their project data directly into Excel or in PDF. However, third-party reporting and exporting apps like Bridge24 for Asana can simplify exporting requirements.
Companies that use Asana are able to communicate more easily, improve team accountability, set goals more clearly, and meet deadlines consistently. Asana provides a simple-to-use but robust work management tool that keeps teams organized and connected.
Evaluating Asana’s pros and cons can serve as a guide to organizations looking for the right work and project management software that best fits their needs.
Asana is a robust project management system that combines powerful scheduling, collaboration, documentation, and reporting tools in a single secure platform.

Project Management,"Asana Review
Asana is one of those unique project management tools that prioritize the team as well as the project manager. While some project management software options focus only on streamlining the management experience, Asana incentivizes every member of the team to use the software for their own benefit through worker-centric features and a simple user interface.
Who is Asana for?
Asana is a project management software that is best suited to smaller teams looking to improve their collaboration and accountability when working on assignments. When it comes to ease of use and navigation, its user interface and user experience are virtually unparalleled.
When I originally wrote this review, I remarked on the lack of any reporting or budgeting features, which made it hard to recommend this tool outside of a narrow collaborative setting. I brought up these concerns to one of the heads of feature development at Asana as a pain point while reviewing the platform. Upon re-reviewing Asana, she let me know that this was something the company took seriously and now offers as part of its Premium tier and above.
While some of Asana's design choices still fit the needs of smaller companies rather than global conglomerates, the addition of these new features puts it into the category of a full-fledged project management tool rather than just a simple collaboration platform.
Asana's key features
Asana's features are all about empowering the entire team rather than just the project manager. The emphasis is on task and workload management features that allow the team to prioritize different aspects of the project without burning out. Unfortunately Asana doesn't offer any native budgeting or invoicing features, making it more of a collaborative tool than a full stack project management software.
Security features
•	Single Sign On (SSO) integrations: Asana integrates with multiple big-name SSO providers, such as Okta, One Login, Google Authenticate, LastPass, and Bitium.
•	Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Airtable allows you to set up additional identity verification through 2FA.
•	Advanced account permissions: Protect your assets by using granular permissions (task, team, and project) controls to restrict access to only the correct users.
Management and planning features
•	Task prioritization and scheduler: Asana gives users the choice of creating, scheduling, and prioritizing tasks in several different formats including task lists, Gantt (timeline) charts, and kanban boards. This gives you the flexibility to track your teams and projects however it suits you.
•	Shared team calendar: If you need a long term view of your project, Asana has you covered with a shared team calendar that you or your team can access and update in real-time.
•	Resource management and time tracking: Use Asana to track your two most valuable project resources -- workload and time spent on tasks. Unfortunately the software does not cover most other types of resource management such as tools and materials.
•	Premade templates: Asana offers many premade templates, from marketing projects to product development, that will allow you to jump right into the action with minimal preparation time.
•	Automations: Save time by automating repetitive tasks so you can focus on more dynamic and demanding assignments.
Documentation features
•	Document storage: Store any relevant project files and documents in Asana using the task file attachment tool, that way your team will have access to everything they need at a moment's notice.
Collaboration features
•	Communication: Asana offers comment sections in every task for discussion, collaboration, and resource sharing.
•	File sharing: Every task in Asana allows for file uploads, whether it's documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, or images. You can either drag and drop files into a task or manually browse and upload files as you see fit.
•	Mobile application: Asana offers a mobile version of its software for both iOS and Android users so you can remain in contact with your team and coordinate project tasks on the go.
Budgeting and reporting features
•	Report dashboards: Asana now offers report dashboards that cover many useful project insights, such as task completion over time and budget projections.
Benefits of using Asana
After reviewing Asana and speaking with one of their lead software developers, I've come to the conclusion that what really sets Asana apart is the focus on making all users want to use their product. Unlike other project management tools, this software does not revolve solely around the project manager. For example, Asana offers a feature called ""Workload,"" which provides live visual representations of every team member's current tasks and shows if anyone is particularly overloaded.
This feature provides the dual benefit of preventing burnouts, as well as incentivizing team members to track all of their work as it comes in. Not only that, but by using ""Workload,"" your team will not need to waste time in meetings discussing who is doing what and when they are doing it.
This kind of mentality is seen throughout Asana, from the multiple task management methods to choose from (work timelines, to-do lists, kanban boards), to their simple user-interface.
For example, the kanban system for Asana is so simple that you can create task cards at any point in the workflow. I've never seen that before in a kanban system -- most only have one ""new task"" button and once you've created the task, you'll have to move it to the appropriate step. Of course, in a way this kind of system is solving problems that don't really exist, but it definitely shows their commitment to convenience.
In my opinion, Asana takes the simplicity of Basecamp and adds a dose of flexible functionality to create a truly seamless collaboration experience.
Asana's pricing
Asana's pricing is a little steep. Once you upgrade beyond the free ""Basic"" package, the next two pricing tiers of $10.99/month per user or $24.99/month per user will really add up over time. While I highly recommend this product for smaller teams based on its functionality, Asana is best for small teams with large budgets.
Even relatively small teams of 10 users are looking at roughly over $100/month per user for a package that doesn't include Workload and Adobe Creative Cloud unless you go up to the next tier plans: Business and Enterprise.
However, not only is it potentially cheaper than a collaboration tool like Basecamp, but it also has additional visual tracking aids, such as charts, timelines, kanban, etc.
•	Basic: Free -- Task lists, kanban boards, calendars, app integrations, up to 15 users.
•	Premium: $10.99/user/month with annual contract - All previous features, timelines, advanced searches, project and budget dashboards, priority support, custom field creation, forms, and milestones.
•	Business: $24.99/user per month with annual contract -- All previous features, portfolios, Workload, forms, automatic proofing, priority support, Adobe Creative Cloud integration.
•	Enterprise: Pricing negotiated with the client -- All previous features, user provisioning, data exporting, custom branding, priority support.
Asana's ease of use
Building a quality project management tool is always a balancing act between user experience and functionality. Either you're adding so many features that the user experience suffers, or you prioritize ease of use and leave lots of functions behind. The good news is that Asana is able to strike a very healthy balance between these two competing interests.
Asana prides itself on creating a project management software that is accessible to as many people as possible, while providing several task management options and useful team collaboration features. In fact, when you start up Asana for the first time you can take your pick from dozens of templates to get started, such as:
•	1:1 Meeting Agenda
•	Digital Fundraising Campaign
•	New Employee Onboarding
•	Editorial Calendar
•	Agency Collaboration
•	Design Project Plan
•	Software and System Development
•	Bug Tracking
•	Product Roadmap
In my opinion, Asana is one of the few project management tools that you can pick up with very little instruction from the vendor. However, if you do need help, Asana's support service is more than willing to assist you.
Navigating through Asana is also simple with the single left-side menu which lists out all of your key destinations, such as the home dashboard or task lists. I never felt lost while using Asana, but if I had done, Asana was there to help me through my first project with instructions at the bottom of the screen. Each task I add to my project gives me the ability to set its current stage, how high of a priority that task is, and whether or not that task has been approved by my ""higher-ups.""
As I complete tasks, they are added to the reports section, where I can see which tasks are finished and which ones are still in progress. No percentages, complex formulas, or strange key combinations are needed to get the information I want. Just point and click.
In my original review of Asana, I was so bent out of shape about the lack of budgeting and reporting tools that I recommended Asana alternatives and other tools that would help make up for the lack of these features. Today I am very happy to revise my review and say that Asana made a 180-degree turn in this department by adding these features and executing them in an exceptionally accessible manner. The design and usability of this reporting fits well with the rest of the platform as an easy-to-use and understand addition.
I hope the company maintains this level of usability as it grows and develops the product. I would hate for them to fall down a rabbit hole of complexity like so many other project management tools before them. Right now, when it comes to intuitive design and easy collaboration, Asana is hard to beat.
Working with Asana support
Asana provides several options for customer support, such as onboarding documents, forums, webinars, guides, training, use cases, developer's guide, and support articles.
Currently, it does not offer phone support. If you want to chat to troubleshoot or get questions answered, you'll need to email or post a question in the Asana forum.
But if you upgrade to a premium subscription, you'll have access to priority support. This plan (and the pricier ones) include a customer success manager (CSM) that can help with on-site training, coaching calls, onboarding, and solving problems as they arise.",Asana
Project Management,"What is Asana and Why Should We Use It?
Asana is the task management tool that everybody is talking about. It is a great way to manage even the largest and most complex projects. It provides a platform where teams of various professions can come together and collaborate on one space.
Asana was founded in 2008 by two former Facebook executives Dustin Moskovitz and Justin Rosenstein. The word Asana is an old Sanskrit word, which refers to a popular yoga position. Channelling the inner conscience, the main goal of Asana was to improve work efficiency by greatly reducing the number of emails and meetings that team members often need to engage with, in order to effectively communicate.
Asana places itself as a tool that can help replace the slew of emails, spreadsheets and sticky notes on your desk with a far more all encompassing solution with everything you need in the one place. It is flexible to work in a way that is most effective for you; whether it be in a kanban-style board, checklist or a Gantt chart. Asana can be used to keep check on day to day tasks as well as monitor the overall goals and progress of the project as a whole.
The main features of Asana is the ability to create a comprehensive list of tasks, share details on actions that are required and set deadlines for the whole project. This allows everybody to have goals assigned to them and allows the team to work in one common direction. Planning out a project in this manner allows potential risks and bottlenecks to be spotted early on and ensure the project flows as effectively as possible — even if the project was to change half way through.
Creation of Projects
When creating a new project, the tasks can be set out in a style of your choice. The project can be laid out in a good old fashioned list or in a kanban board layout.
In the kanban board, we can split tasks out into different categories, which can come in handy if tasks need to be split into different priorities levels. For instance, when I develop a website, it is useful to split out tasks for each page into a separate list. Sometimes it can be useful to have a list of tasks that need to be complete by the end of the project, but not necessarily the immediate priority.
Boards can also be split out into a list of tasks that need to be completed by a different person, so everybody is clear about what is required from them. Each board could potentially be a list of tasks for each day, week or month. As mentioned previously, Asana is flexible and can adapt to your needs.
Task Details
For the list view, a quick description of the task is fine, however if the task is to be delegated to another person, then extra information is required. This is where the additional details come in handy. For each task, we can provide additional details such as assigning a due date and a detailed description of the task. We can also add comments to tasks if any additional communication is required between team members.
It is also in this section where you assign tasks to specific team members, which allows everybody to be clear on what work they need to do. Tasks can also be sorted by the team member assigned, which is handy for quickly viewing the tasks required for a specific person or team. We can also set the priority score to low, medium or high, so that everybody is clear on what needs to be done first. Finally, each task has a progress score, so we can see at a glance how each task is progressing and alter the priority to more urgent, should it fall behind schedule.
If you need specific resources for a task, files can be uploaded to each task. For instance: images, spreadsheets, word documents and PDFs can now all be accessed in the one place. Do you have a task that you need to assign to somebody, but don’t know how to properly describe it? No problem, just take a quick screenshot of the problem and upload the image to the task for quick and easy access later on.
Timeline View
A feature that is new as of 2018, Asana Premium now provides a timeline view, which integrates Gantt chart functionality with your list of tasks. For each task, we can assign resources, team members and dependencies.
With this new view, we can see how all of our tasks can be linked together and organise them in a way that allows them to get completed as efficiently as possible. Furthermore, we can identify bottlenecks in the process or any conflicts at the start of the project and provide a solution to allow a smooth process from start to finish.
Tasks can be reordered and rescheduled in order to alleviate any potential roadblocks in the project by using the drag and drop user interface. This can be useful when the deadlines of a project change or new tasks need to be added to the timeline.
Teams
Another key Asana feature is the ability to create teams. For each team, we can group together a specific set of people to a team that they work for e.g. sales. Working in this way is very efficient as when a new project is created, it can be assigned to a team, which is far quicker than adding each person individually. Furthermore, teams will update dynamically, should the team change its personnel in the future.
Finally, the benefit of using teams allows each member of staff to be able to view the work that they need to. For instance, when a staff member logs in, it allows for a clutter-free experience, which allows staff to focus on the work that they need to do. On the other hand, assigning projects to teams can prevent staff members from viewing sensitive data that should only be reserved for the lucky few. In this manner, teams can be used as a method of delegating access.
Calendar
The calendar view allows us to view the tasks that need to be completed within a given timeframe. This view is inline with what we can expect from Outlook and Apple Mail.
With the calendar view, we can see any potentual overlaps or conflicts in the schedule. With the easy to use drag and scale interface, we can reorder tasks and change the duration quickly and easily to make sure our project remains on schedule.
Reporting and Notifications
When working on a project across multiple documents, emails and staff meetings, it can be difficult to assess how the project is progressing. On the Progress tab, we can see at a glance how the project is getting on. Here, we can see useful information such as status updates from key stakeholders, a burnup chart to visualise progress and other important data such as start and end date.
The status update is a great way of keeping everybody involved in a project up to date with the latest events. A status update can be assigned a colour of green, orange or red to indicate if the project is on track, at risk or off track. In addition, the @mentioning feature allows status updates to directly involve specific team members if a task requires their assistance.
Another great feature of the status updates is that they can be used to send notifications to specific users, which they can receive in the inbox tab. A notification is added to your inbox each time a user mentions you in a comment or assigns you to a task. If the transition from email to Asana is a challenge initially, notifications can be sent as emails as well.
Portfolio
Portfolios allows groups of projects to be assembled in the one area. This allows multiple projects to be ran for one organisation, meaning that tasks can be assigned to specific projects, whilst all being grouped to the same parent organisation.
A great feature of the portfolio view is the ability to view the progress of multiple projects at the same time. Therefore, multiple projects can run concurrently and be managed effectively. Furthermore, the ability of Asana to grow and scale its performance based on your requirements is a key benefit that cannot be underestimated.
Files
As mentioned previously, documents can be uploaded to specific tasks. This can come in handy if a task requires extra information from a word document, spreadsheet, PDF etc. It is a useful feature of Asana that all the files can be found in one place, rather than searching through old emails in order to find what you are looking for.
The other way to view files is on the Files tab, which allows you to view all of the files in a sequential list. Having a the ability to view all the files in this format can be useful if you cannot remember which task you attached the file to.
Integration and Mobile App
The key selling point of Asana is the ability the pull data from several sources and consolidate them all in one space. So, as we discussed, Asana reduces the need for team meetings, email chains and checklists scribbled down on pieces of paper on your desk. Why have a fragmented approach to work when you can have everything in the one place?
Furthermore to that, Asana can be integrated with existing digital solutions such as GMail, Dropbox, Slack, Outlook and over 100 different platforms. Do you use Harvest or TimeCamp to manage your time in specific tasks? Import them into your Asana project. Do you have a spreadsheet setup with your tasks already? Export that as a CSV and import them straight into Asana.
The Asana app is available on iOS and Android and retains the same look and feel of the desktop application. It also offers the core of the features provided on the desktop app. It is a pretty neat application that comes in handy if you need to add to your to-do list on the go.
Conclusion
Overall, Asana is an excellent task management tool that can help bring order to chaos on even the largest of projects. By consolidating all the necessary information into one place, we can stop doing work about work and focus on the tasks that really matter. By using Asana, you can stay on task and never miss a deadline again.",Asana
Project Management,"Monday.com is an online collaboration and work-management app. Some people may call it a project management app, but that's not its forte since it's not designed to help you juggle tasks and schedules across many projects with ease (although it does have Gantt charts). Monday.com is more like a collection of highly customized spreadsheets in which everyone on a team logs the tasks they need to complete and updates them with status reports and other relevant information. It has a modern, attractive interface and is fairly easy to use, but other apps offer a substantial free plan and more straightforward subscription options. We recommend Editors' Choice winner Asana for its incredible flexibility, good value, and free tier of service. How Much Does Monday.com Cost? Monday.com doesn't charge per person. Instead, it has prices for groups up to a certain number. For example, a team of up to five people starts at $60 per month. A team of up to 20 people starts at $240 per month. If you have 16 people on your team, you must pay for a plan of up to 20 people. If you have more than 40 people on your team, the website instructs you to contact the sales team for a custom quote. It's worth noting that in the last few years, prices at Monday.com have gone up considerably. What Is Monday.com?
Monday.com looks like it evolved from collaborative spreadsheets. Imagine Google Sheets in the hands of an extraordinarily capable designer. You access Monday.com as a web app or on a mobile device (iOS and Android).
The initial setup is a simple grid. You choose what goes into it. What would elsewhere be called sheets are called boards here, and you can have more than one of them in view at any given time. Monday.com also shares similarities with kanban apps, and indeed. Each row typically contains a task or whatever it is you want to track. The columns indicate different attributes of that task, such as the deadline or who is assigned to do it. You define the columns as you like, and you decide what selections are available for each column. For example, you could have columns dedicated to different states of completion. Let's say the task is to fulfill an online order. The first column might indicate whether payment has been received. Is it owed, pending, or paid? The person in charge of monitoring payments could update this cell. The next column might tell you whether the items have been prepared for shipping. A person in the fulfillment department could update that cell. Perhaps the column after that denotes if a shipping label has been printed. The result is that all the people responsible for ushering a sale from payment to shipping can collaboratively update the sheet and track the process.",Monday.com

For Product and Dev Teams
monday.com functions as a centralized workspace for your product development teams. It is a versatile tool for planning product iterations, developing and monitoring product roadmaps, tracking blogs, and smoothly managing product development workflows.",Monday.com
Project Management,"Monday.com is excellent at tracking projects and other information all in one place. It has a built-in CRM that makes project management and customer information tracking a snap. Build your sales team’s cohesion with Monday.com’s collaboration tools, so you always keep track of contacts, lead scoring, campaigns, and much more. Let’s dive into how having a CRM and project management software combination can catapult your business ventures. Pricing: 4.5/5 Onboarding: 4/5 Ease of use: 3.5/5 Task management: 4/5 Collaboration: 5/5 Workflow and Visibility: 3.5/5 Pricing: 4.5/5 – Monday.com’s pricing is average for the project management space, but you are getting a lot more for every dollar you spend. The built-in customer relationship management tools make managing projects more efficient, and you don’t have to shell out more cash for a CRM software subscription. Build your sales funnels, organize your contacts and leads with precision, and plan out your sales projects with project management features in one place. The Basic plan is $9 per user per month for a yearly payment, or $12 per user per month for a monthly payment plan. They have a minimum of three users required, so it really starts at $29 or $36 per month, depending on how you pay. You can also add an unlimited number of additional users for $8 more per month. The next higher plan is $7 more per month for each user and gives you multiple project management views you don’t get on the entry-level plan, like Gantt, calendar, and map views. A free plan is available, which allows for unlimited projects. You can create up to 1,000 tasks, use templates and custom fields, and more for up to two users. It’s not the best free plan, but it’s a good place to start if you want to get your hands dirty before going all-in. Now, we can move on to actually getting started with the software. Onboarding: 4/5 – Monday.com is situated between Trello and ClickUp in terms of a streamlined setup process. There are walkthroughs that show you a high-level overview to help you get acquainted with the software and how it works, plus pre-built project demos to show you how all the pieces work together. The interactive product tour shows you how to look at the project dashboard and how to access the built-in project management learning center. You’ll also learn how to rename a project, how to create and edit tasks, how to assign tasks, how to look at Gantt view, and how to see tasks assigned to just you. There are many templates to help you get started. But, unfortunately, a lot of the templates include features you don’t have access to on the entry-level tier. You can use them during a free trial but you can’t use them once your trial expires and you start paying for the actual plan. This is typical, but it’s not super clear which templates those are, either. You’ll just find out after the trial expires and you try to use one. When you first begin, choose if your plan will be for work, school, personal, or nonprofit use. Then, set your role in the company and choose departments to use the platform for, like sales and CRM, marketing, HR, IT, operations, or something else. Monday.com’s software allows you to dictate how you want to use it, so it can help you maximize what you’re trying to do. The marketing track, for example, focuses on reaching the best possible leads and prospects, while sales and CRM homes in on building your client lists and keeping clients well-managed and happy. This is very unique compared to other platforms that just leave you to make your business fit inside their software’s dynamic. There are several items Monday.com could have added to take this onboarding process to the next level, but they fail to offer more hand-holding on how to use other features. The learning center helps, but you have to know what you’re looking for or what you want to learn. A little extra help getting set up would have imrpoved Monday’s score in this category. Ease of use: 3.5/5 – We all want things to be simple. Monday.com only checked a couple boxes for features that make navigating the software pain-free. The overall platform is fine, but there were a few inefficiencies compared to the other platforms we tested. For example, advanced search is available, but it’s kind of confusing. There are two search bars you can use. One is super basic and only lets you filter by project. The other gives you more control, but isn’t quite as advanced as other search functions. Monday.com makes using the software in common languages other than English pretty simple. There are 12 other languages, excluding English, that your team can use the platform in. There are other tools that cover more languages, but it’s a decent range and more than a mere two or three that some tools offer. Task management: 4/5 – You’ll be able to get more detailed with task management in Monday.com than you can with some of the lighter tools. It’s not quite as easy to master as Trello, but you can drill down into the specifics a lot easier with Monday.com.
If you don’t have features that help you manage your tasks within a project’s lifecycle, you can pretty much kiss your organization goodbye. Monday.com being both a CRM and project management vehicle makes this somewhat intuitive, though it’s missing a few key features other providers have in their entry-level plans. In other words, we could see the allure of the gated features in the premium plans. Collaboration: 5/5 – Monday.com does a phenomenal job helping your team work together. You get a built-in document system that promotes collaboration, with unlimited storage. That’s great for creating sales letters or SLAs on the fly for prospects and customers. Workflow and Visibility: 3.5/5 – The workflow and project visibility in Monday.com is fairly restricted on the entry-level plan, which we tested, and there are some limits to premium plans that bothered our research team.
For basic project tracking, Monday.com can provide helpful charts, but it’s certainly not a data visualization tool.
The entry-level plan gives you dashboards and list and table views for reviewing project data.",Monday.com
Project Management,"The Cons or Disadvantages of Monday.com While most users of Monday.com are satisfied with the software, others have specific needs or leave due to missing features. Some common issues include: Per-user pricing limits: Monday uses tiered, per-user pricing, and adding users with complete collaboration permission incurs additional costs. Additionally, the more valuable features are in higher-priced plans, which may deter some SMBs. Difficult to track time and expenses: Some users find it challenging to track time against each task and the cost for all the related tasks for a particular client. Also, Monday does not have a Gantt chart or plans to introduce one. Interface clutter: A few users find the interface cluttered, disorganized, or confusing. Also, some visualizations, like the kanban board, could be improved. Users need more time to get familiar with the terms and functions to navigate the platform better. Limited mobile app: Some complain that the mobile app, particularly the iPhone native app, does not update well. The dashboards do not have an equivalent view on the mobile app, and users unanimously say the mobile app needs to be improved. Integration problems: Although Monday integrates with Dropbox, Excel, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Slack, Trello, and a few others, including Zapier, some users desire additional integration options, such as with Salesforce, Sharepoint, and other popular third-party applications. Also, they want better API integration. The Pros or Advantages of Monday.com
Although not suitable for every situation, many teams prefer Monday.com for the following features:
Built for multiple users: The software allows more than one user to edit a list at any time, making it collaboration-ready. It also enables teams to send each other messages, which is helpful for remote teams.
Great tracking features: Whether tracking tasks’ progress or issues’ status, Monday performs these functions well. The visual boards and user interface provide information at a glance, and color coding alerts users where immediate attention is needed.
Alternative Views: While it lacks a Gantt chart, Monday provides a timeline view that many users find appropriate. It still enables teams to track progress and stay aware of upcoming deadlines. Other views include a kanban board and a calendar view.
Powerful communication tool: The software makes inviting guests to view boards and timelines easy, whether they are part of the company or external partners. This feature centralizes communication and ensures that information does not fall through the cracks.
Reliable project organization and management: Monday allows teams to organize their project information, resources, schedules, tasks, and communication in a highly accessible workspace. Additional features like notification and automation eliminate administrative work, enabling teams to focus on meaningful work. Monday.com Use Cases
Monday.com is used by hundreds of thousands of teams across 146 countries to manage their work successfully. Here are some of the ways that teams use this project management platform and collaboration tool:
Daily tasks and ongoing project management: Teams create action boards with columns or pulses that outline their workflow. Work-related tasks move through a team member’s board for them to complete or delegate.
Communication tracking: Rather than using spreadsheets or other documents to track communications, such as emails, phone calls, and social media posts, teams can use a board to monitor communication status and attach original emails.
Creative project management: Graphic design teams can create a Monday board to develop and track graphic design or other creative projects. They can post upcoming work, schedule due dates, assign it to individual designers, and communicate through the board.
Real estate property and client tracking: Real estate companies and agencies can set up a board listing all their properties. From there, they can track daily activities and related projects, such as leasing and maintenance. They can prioritize items, delegate tasks, update each other, and monitor workflow.
Client work tracking: Marketing teams can track client projects from their board. The project manager creates tasks, assigns them, and sets the timeframe. Team members complete the assigned tasks, such as writing materials, shooting videos, developing promotions, etc. Is Monday.com Secure? (Security and Privacy)

Project Management,"Use Cases of monday.com 1.) Task Management Task management is crucial to getting work done. Every industry has some form of tasks, and task management is a great business use case for monday.com! Everyone generally has a preferred way of tracking their work, whether it be sticky notes (as I’m guilty of myself) or a notes app of some kind. Whatever method you prefer, they work for you, but how do you convey what you’re working on to others? How do you know someone else isn’t doing that already? How do you ensure this won’t cause information silos in your business? We use monday.com to run a brief morning meeting every workday, allowing teammates to align time, collaborate on ideas, and assign tasks. As a result, managers understand the team’s workday, have an overview they can trust and ensure everyone gets time face-to-face. 2.) Team Management Team management is a vital element in any business in any industry. For example, without a properly managed team, you could have a store full of customers and no employees to work the register. Or maybe you’re a service-based company with appointments scheduled for today; how would you know who’s taking those appointments or is even available? Being a manager is tough, and the transition to remote/hybrid work caused by the pandemic has only made it more challenging. Thankfully team management on monday.com is a breeze. Use customizable columns to build your employee database, set up team-based notifications, update or tag an entire team, and much more. You should have a place to track and record completion for businesses where training, skills assessments, or certifications are required for employee onboarding. 3.) Project Management When most people think of a business use case for monday.com, the first thing that comes to mind is project management, and that’s because they make it possible to manage practically any project in any way. With dozens of views and configurations, customized dashboard overviews, and limitless column structures, you can build any project management workflow you need. Here at CarbonWeb, we’re constantly working on projects simultaneously. For example, in the last 30-days, we’ve given the website a facelift, pivoted our branding while developing new apps and products, and doing all this while still delivering optimized work environments to our remarkable client base! When your business is workflow, you’d expect ours to be the best, but it turned out we were due for an upgrade ourselves! To give you an idea, look at our new Internal Marketing Projects Dashboard below. This dashboard pulls information from four different boards in our new project management workflow! 4.) Creative & Design Management Piggy-backing off the project management use case, creative and design management, planning, and more! As I mentioned before about working on multiple projects, creative teams work on many different things. So managing all those things and ensuring communication through and through is vital. Knowing the status of projects and who’s working on them is essential and can ultimately mean the difference between a marketing campaign going out on time or not. You can integrate with leading design tools like Figma, Adobe, and Canva too! Below you’ll see a limited view of our To-Do Design board, which is the third step in our internal marketing project workflow! Here we’ve mirrored the project priority status from the overall project to ensure everyone working on the design task knows how essential that project is. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) There isn’t anything more crucial to a business than the customers. With that, maintaining your relationships is vital to business growth. Most people use a CRM or customer relationship management system to effectively manage these relationships. What sets monday apart from most when it comes to the topic of CRMs is the customizability and sandbox nature of the platform. Creating malleable custom environments, lead pipelines, and outreach workflows is unmatched by any other software. Now add all this to your ability to integrate it directly with other systems in your Work OS. Combine dashboards, unique user views, in-board dialing integrations, activity tracking, and automations with proposal generators, invoicing systems, and more. Only on monday can you create a genuinely end-to-end automated CRM. 6.) Marketing Management One of my favorite things to do on monday is marketing management, specifically ad management. All the other boards displayed thus far are active in our workflow, and the next one is no exception. Starting as a marketing agency, we had to develop systems and processes for managing, executing, and delivering client work. From my personal experience, everyone manages ads a little bit differently. At CarbonWeb, we wanted to ensure we standardized the process for our marketing team, so we could onboard clients, stay organized, and do a great job managing ads. Our process begins with a form to gather campaign-specific info used in content development and then delivered to an ad manager. This is all happening within our Work OS. So much so that when we need text written, it’s assigned to a writer automatically in that To-Do task management board we mentioned previously. Now that’s the power of automation! 7.) Festival / Events Management
Managing festivals and events is a tremendous task, but ensuring a good end product is essential. With hundreds or even hundreds of thousands of people planning to spend their precious time at your event, delivering something worthwhile is your core focus. With travel plans, talent, equipment, vendors, caterers, contractors, staff, setup, ticketing, security, there’s a lot that needs to go right, with no room for error. It’s come to my attention that most of the events industry still uses excel at the core of their planning. I just want to ask why? Seeing what event planning looks like from the inside, it was crazy to see the amount of excel sheets necessary for putting on a successful event with headline artists. Grocery Management / Meal Planning
In all seriousness, monday can be used for practically anything, and I hope I’ve shown that with this blog.
Now, a quick story about this last use case.
I created this on the weekend a few months back when I got tired of figuring out the different ingredients needed for the meals I like to cook. I live solo, so when I’m at the store, I’m the only one to remind myself to grab something. And frankly, I have a track record of being one ingredient short when I want to make something, especially waffles. (I have a secret recipe, ask me about it sometime.)
Anyways, with my experience on monday, I figured, “Heck, why not make a board for this too?” and so I did. The kicker, our CEO Jack Kubicek, stumbled across it one day in my private workspace while doing routine account clean-up. The best part is that it got to stay because he thought it was a great board and a good idea. Now, this is an excellent example of “other” non-business-related use cases monday is great for managing. I was able to build a “workflow” to streamline and simplify a routine task with automation. This makes shopping easier and removes the friction of remembering what I need to buy without having to write a new list every time. I simply click a button to add a meal to this week’s menu, and then I have a list of ingredients I can check against my current kitchen stock!",Monday.com
Project Management,"Monday.com – What are the Advanced Features That Make It Different?
If you can't use the software effectively, it shouldn't matter if you choose any project management solution. Ever heard about Monday.com? This software offers advanced features that make it different from others. In this post, we will dive into the features, and of course, the Monday.com software Demo.
What Makes Monday.com Unique?
What good are tools when people don't like them that much? If someone is proficient with a tool and can use it regularly, they should like to use it. This is the reason why the tool should really help that person achieve objectives. Yes, it is the primary metric. However, ease of use also comes as a second opinion. The user interface of this software is one of the easiest ones amongst other project management tools. Undoubtedly, this software offers a complete set of advanced features. Another great thing is, this Monday.com offers a customizable dashboard. When it comes to visualization, people have their own preferences. Some people like Gantt charts or timeline tracking boards. On the home screen of Monday.com software, you can view each project board created using a variety of visual tools. Thus, it doesn't require much training to get used to it.
Favorite Software for Project Management
No matter how much Monday.com cost is, this is a project management software that's easy to fall in love with. Many users help each other productively by sharing ideas and bulletin boards. In fact, many users have mentioned how well they use their tools. Teams or even organizations working in any industry can benefit from the highly flexible dashboards of this software. Well, with highly customizable deployment options, you can actually do it yourself. Far better, you can also customize the board and save specific ""views"" for each team member.
Advanced Features Offered By Monday.com
Effective Collaboration
All of your team members can update and comment on each item on the issue. Accordingly, they can even do a Q&A that records the knowledge chain generated for each item. This feature helps to improve communication between the team or each member of the team. In fact, multiple users can view and edit important files using file sharing features and hyperlinks. But wait, the effective communication and collaboration offered by Monday.com software do not end there. Other features make it simple and enjoyable to interact with your team members. Two of these features are phone and email columns. Yes, you can add phone numbers for team members or customers and call them directly from this software. As soon as you click, you can start making calls or composing emails from the main application on your computer. Well, this is surely worth the Monday.com cost!
Easily Manage All the Workloads
From Monday.com demo, it shows that you can do group assignments on this platform. You can then assign each task to one person on your team or an entire team to complete the task. Another great thing about these teams and tasks is that you can add extra columns. You can easily start by placing items on a horizontal bar. Then you can add the appropriate columns. At the center of the column, you will find various types of columns. Some are as simple as checkboxes or hyperlinks. You can also find unique ones such as maps, progress trackers, timelines & statuses, and even phones. This phone column is the one that allows you to call your contacts directly from this software
Reporting and Analysis
As you might know, Monday.com software is not a fan of traditional project management. The creators take what they think is the best feature of the existing system and do that. This is evident in timeline features that track people better. However, you can find a Gantt chart view if you want to keep the tradition. The column is a star on this software. In addition, this column will help you to track your progress easily in real-time. Accordingly, you can display your data in different views. However, when it comes to reports, it is the filters that make it easy to create visually compelling and easily understandable reports. It may not provide a good visualization when selecting a view such as a pie chart, a Gantt chart, or a timeline. Instead, if you need a formal written report for storage or presentation, you can also export it to an Excel file. Of course, it will take time to understand these features. That is why cost of the Monday.com demo enables you to have access to a great support knowledge base with tutorials. When you log in, you can view reporting guides such as user engagement and storage. These features make it relatively easy to use raw data and process it to generate useful ideas. With the affordable cost of Monday.com, this software is worth having!
Provides Excellent Support
The core monitoring, collaboration, reporting, tracking, and other features discussed earlier are undoubtedly complemented by great support features. Again, Monday.com is primarily focused on people. This software is designed to be an efficient and flexible tool that users will enjoy using. Accessibility is one of the important factors for this. It is not a user interface or ergonomic aspect. Yet, it is more about Monday.com cost and other support features. They make this software an undeniably top-quality product. Eventually, it becomes an ideal platform for many teams in various industries.v The Monday.com pricing plans make it easy for teams to use this platform for their projects. The basic plan starts at $39 monthly which is available for 5 users. The price is very reasonable, especially if we take a look at all those advanced features. The best part? The plan offers unlimited viewers and unlimited boards. The software also offers advanced plans that include additional features and capabilities. They include a full suite of integrations and automation. With these supporting features, Monday.com software is not only easy to use but also comprehensive. Yet, it is also accessible to many types of teams of different sizes.",Monday.com
Project Management,"Top 10 Cons & Disadvantages of Monday.com Software
Monday.com, a popular project management software, has garnered widespread attention for its versatility and user-friendly interface. However, like any tool, it comes with its drawbacks that users should be aware of before diving in. This software, designed to streamline workflow and enhance team collaboration, has been a game-changer for many businesses. Yet, some users have encountered challenges that have impacted their overall experience.
Adopting new software always comes with a learning curve, and Monday.com is no exception. Users often praise its ability to organize and manage tasks efficiently, but several issues have been raised that can hinder productivity and user satisfaction. Understanding these pitfalls is crucial for potential users to make an informed decision. It’s also essential for current users struggling with these issues to find solutions or workarounds.
Top 10 Cons & Disadvantages of Using Monday.com Software
The world of project management tools is vast, and Monday.com has emerged as a significant player. However, users have reported a variety of cons and disadvantages that impact their experience. From overwhelming options in its integration and automation lists to less-than-satisfactory customer support, these issues can significantly affect the efficiency and usability of the software. Understanding these top 10 disadvantages is crucial for anyone considering Monday.com as their go-to project management tool.
1. Overwhelming Integration and Automation Options
Monday.com offers many integration and automation options, which, while intended to enhance productivity, often lead to confusion and inefficiency. Users report spending considerable time sifting through these options to find their needs, resulting in a steep learning curve. For instance, a marketing team struggled to automate their social media posting schedule due to overwhelming choices. They spent hours researching and testing different integrations before finding a suitable solution. To resolve this issue, Monday.com could streamline its options, categorize them more intuitively, and provide more precise, targeted guidance for each feature.
2. Limited Visibility of Notes
In an ideal scenario, users could view all notes associated with a task without opening each individually. However, Monday.com currently lacks this feature, which can slow down the workflow. For example, a project manager found opening each task to view the notes cumbersome, leading to missed information and inefficiencies. A solution could be introducing a hover-over feature or a side panel that displays all notes related to a task at a glance, enhancing user experience and saving time.
3. Inadequate Customer Support
Many users have expressed dissatisfaction with Monday.com’s customer support, especially regarding responsiveness and helpfulness. A user recounted emailing their representative for assistance without any response, leaving them to figure out the platform independently. To improve this, Monday.com should invest in a more robust, responsive, and knowledgeable customer support team, ensuring users receive timely and effective help.
4. Initial User Overwhelm
New users often find Monday.com overwhelming due to its many features and modules. A beginner reported feeling lost in the array of options, struggling to find where to start. This can be mitigated by providing a more guided, step-by-step onboarding process, with tutorials tailored to different levels of user expertise.
5. Comparison with Competitors
Compared to similar tools like Trello, some users find Monday.com lacking in automation and visual appeal. A team transitioning from Trello to Monday.com noted the latter’s less intuitive Kanban board and automation features. Monday.com could benefit from enhancing these aspects, possibly by taking inspiration from its competitors, to improve user experience.
6. Inflexible Board Settings
The inability to customize board settings for different user demographics is a notable limitation. A user highlighted their frustration with not being able to delete certain board settings, which were irrelevant to their team’s needs. Monday.com could address this by allowing more customization and flexibility in board settings, catering to diverse user requirements.
7. Inconsistent Platform Updates
While some users appreciate the updates and new features added to Monday.com, others find the changes disruptive. A user cited an example where a much-needed feature was added only after they had developed a workaround. More consistent and user-focused updates, perhaps based on user feedback and requests, could enhance the platform’s usability.
8. Pricing Structure
Monday.com’s pricing structure, particularly its bundling of user seats, is a major concern for many. For example, a small business owner found it financially impractical to pay for 20 seats when they only needed 16. A more flexible pricing model would be more user-friendly, with options for small teams and incremental user additions.
9. Design and Clutter
The platform’s design can be overwhelming and cluttered, impacting user navigation and efficiency. A user compared it unfavorably with other software, citing its high price as unjustified given the design flaws. Simplifying the interface and making it more intuitive could significantly improve user satisfaction.
10. Limitations for Small Teams
The current structure and pricing of Monday.com can be prohibitive for small teams. A small business owner wished for per-user licenses instead of bundles, finding the “My Week” feature lacking compared to competitors. Tailoring features and pricing for small teams and enhancing functionalities like timeline views could make Monday.com more appealing to a broader audience.
How Could these Disadvantages be Overcome?
1.	Streamlining Options: Simplify the interface and categorize features more intuitively.
2.	Enhancing Visibility: Introducing features for easier access to task-related notes.
3.	Improving Customer Support: Expanding and training the support team for better responsiveness.
4.	Tailored Onboarding: Offering customized tutorials and onboarding processes.
5.	Competitive Feature Enhancement: Upgrading features based on competitor analysis and user feedback.
What is Monday.com Software?

Now that we’ve gone through what Jira is and its pros and cons, it’s time to see what it is used for and why it’s massively popular in the IT industry. Listed below are the most common use cases of Jira:
Test case management and requirements
There’s no doubt that Jira offers a robust hub for the coding, release, and collaboration stages of development. Additionally, the tools allow integrations with multiple add-ons for test case management. This way, QA (quality assurance) testing enters the software development cycle seamlessly, enabling teams to test efficiently and iteratively. QA teams can majorly benefit from Jira’s customized issues, workflows, and screens, as well as the automated and manual test case management fields.
Agile teams
Speaking about what Jira is used for, agile software teams mainly use it for its Kanban and Scrum boards to practice their agile methodologies consistently. These boards also act as task management hubs where agile teams can effortlessly organize their tasks into customizable workflows. This benefits teams by giving them transparency across project timelines and visibility into task status.
Jira’s time-tracking capabilities and real-time performance reports also help teams track their performance over specific periods. Apart from these, Jira is used for email notifications, project-level permissions, and work logging by agile teams.
DevOps
DevOps plays a crucial role in integrating and automating processes between software development and IT teams. This helps these teams to create, test, and release their software within shorter deadlines and more reliably than usual.
In this context, Jira forms the backbone of Atlassian’s Open DevOps, an integrated and open toolchain. Throughout DevOps’s extensive lifecycle, Jira supports the seamless integration of internal and third-party tools. That includes GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Opsgenie, Confluence, and similar monitoring and documentation tools. This ultimately allows teams to focus on better practices like testing, security, automation, feature flagging, observability, deployment, and continuous delivery.
Software development
Jira’s capabilities undoubtedly cater to software developers. Its roadmap and planning tools empower teams to manage feature requirements, budgets, and stakeholders from the first day. Additionally, integrating multiple continuous deliveries and integration tools facilitates transparency across the software development cycle. Once development is good to go, the Jira software can showcase the live production code status data.
Apart from these, software teams can use Jira to quickly and easily deploy new features by integrating feature flagging tools. Jira Service Management, project backlogs, and sprint planning are some more ways Jira is often used in software development.
Bug tracking
While Jira has evolved by leaps and bounds, its core purpose of tracking bugs hasn’t faded by any means. When a problem arises while your team is developing a product, the tasks needed to solve that problem are known as bug tracking. To keep the bigger picture in mind, it’s always essential for teams to analyze any and every bug detected in a project.
Once a bug is captured, Jira automatically allocates and prioritizes it, after which the project manager can track its progress until completion. Teams can also use Jira for bug tracking with customizable workflows, issue backlogs, bug linking, email notifications, project rules, and project-level configuration.
Task and product management
When discussing what Jira is used for, its task management capabilities cannot be overlooked. The software simplifies almost every part of task management by allowing team members to create tasks and allowing managers to assign those tasks appropriately. Furthermore, project managers can add multiple details to the assigned tasks, like due dates, reminders, notes, status, and priorities.
In addition, Jira also has a Subtasks feature that helps break down bigger tasks into simpler, easily consumable, and more manageable steps. Project managers can decide which members can see the progress status and also get notified upon task completion. Task changelogs, email notifications, task relationships, custom fields, and issue hierarchy are a few of the many Jira task management solutions.
Moreover, Jira is also used for product management as it allows teams to customize roadmaps with projects. Once that is done, a team can use such roadmaps to have a rough blueprint of the project’s long-term view. They will also be able to track the progress and share it with other concerned team members.
The best part about Jira’s product management is its ability to add minute details to roadmaps in order to consider dependencies and forecasts. This ensures timely project completion. If that’s not all, the software also has ‘live’ roadmap options, where various teams can collaborate within the same space by integrating the Jira roadmap into Confluence.
Project management
It’s no surprise that project management is one of Jira’s most prevalent use cases. This is primarily because of the software’s excellent capability to configure and fit projects. Managers can use various project templates or create custom ones to best suit their requirements.
If you’re wondering how to use Jira for project management, here’s an easy-to-follow, five-step guide to help you do it seamlessly.
Configuration - Firstly, you must select a pre-made Jira project template to start with your project. This template will allow you to configure your project as per your company’s operations. For instance, given your team and its needs, you may benefit from choosing the Kanban board. However, if the available templates aren’t to your liking, you can easily customize the details and create a custom template based on your needs.
Planning - Jira comes with just about every feature you may need for project planning, whether it’s a roadmap or time-based software development. Start with establishing project tasks and breaking each task into smaller steps using Subtasks. The software defines a task as an ‘Issue’ and shows them on digital cards containing all its details. These can include priority status, deadlines, notes, progress, images, reminders, and so on. Jira can also create various versions of your plan, helping you evaluate best and worst-case scenarios.
Setting up a team - After completing the project plan, you can start your team set up in Jira to start project execution. Project managers can decide which team members can only complete tasks or track progress and which members have complete admin access. The admin will be responsible for third-party app connections and settings configuration. Here, project managers can use Jira’s permission schemes to avoid manually implementing individual permissions.
Tracking - After your team is set up and tasks have been assigned, the next step is progress tracking. Jira has all time-tracking abilities to help you check how long each task takes. Its detailed reports not only give you insight into completion times but also into missed deadlines and possible bottlenecks. Additionally, you can add pie charts and calendar views to track your projects better.
Completion - Lastly, Jira offers two approaches for project completion. The first is to remove a finished project from active usage using Jira’s built-in ‘archive’ feature. This means no one can view or edit the project anymore unless they have access to archives. The second option is to shut off the project’s permissions. This will turn it into a read-only project, where teams can’t add tasks but can check them if needed.",Jira
Project Management,"What is JIRA - How to Use Jira Testing Software Tool Project management can be a cost, time-consuming, and complicated process for many organizations. JIRA is the perfect tool for organizing tasks and managing agile teams.

JIRA is a project management software developed by the Australian company Atlassian. The word JIRA is derived from the Japanese word ‘Gojira’, meaning Godzilla. The software is based on agile methodology. If you’re wondering what is jira used for, the answer is multiple purposes – bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management.

Key JIRA concepts
Some of the key concepts in Jira are:
Projects: They are used to organize and manage work within Jira. Each project contains a set of issues and can have its own custom fields, workflows, and permission schemes.
Issues: They are the primary unit of work in Jira. They represent tasks, bugs, and other work items that need tracking and managing. Issues can be assigned to individuals or teams with various attributes like priority, status, and due date.
Workflows: They define the lifecycle of an issue, including its status and transitions. Jira has a default workflow, but it can also be customized to match the needs of a specific project.
Boards: They are used to visualize and manage the progress of issues in a project. Jira has three types of boards: Scrum boards, Kanban boards, and Agile boards.
Sprints: Sprints are time-boxed periods of work in Scrum methodology. Sprints help teams to focus on a specific set of tasks and deliverables within a fixed timeframe.
Epics: Epics are large work items that are broken down into smaller issues. They provide a high-level view of the work that needs to be done and help teams to prioritize their work.
Versions: Versions are used to track and manage releases of a project. They represent a specific set of features or fixes that are ready to be shipped to users.
Dashboards: Dashboards provide a customizable view of project information, such as status, progress, and key metrics. Dashboards can be shared with team members or stakeholders to provide visibility into the project. Different Uses of JIRA

Project Management,"How to Use Jira for Project Management Jira is a popular project management tool thanks to its numerous capabilities. Learn how to use Jira to manage your projects. Gone are the days when you painstakingly assembled a project plan in a clunky spreadsheet. Today’s project management software makes tackling projects a breeze. The hard part is deciding which tool to adopt. Atlassian’s Jira software stands out among project management collaboration tools because of its popularity, particularly within the information technology (IT) industry. It’s designed especially for teams employing an agile project management methodology, making Jira’s agile tools a natural fit for IT. My software development team and I used it for years. This Jira tutorial helps you apply the software to your project. Overview: What is JIRA? It’s natural to ask, what is Jira? It started as an IT tool, but now it supports many uses, from traditional project management to an IT ticketing system. It covers the project management basics with a comprehensive tools suite, such as project planning, task creation and management, and reporting. The Jira platform complements agile project management practices. Use Jira in conjunction with the agile ceremonies to get the most out of the tool. I often projected my team’s Jira task list on a screen when we met for sprint planning and other agile events, and it worked beautifully to get the team on the same page while streamlining these meetings. The key features of JIRA
Jira possesses many capabilities, and if it’s missing a feature you need, add it by visiting the Atlassian Marketplace, an online store where you can find third-party software to supplement Jira’s core capabilities.
One project management example is the Trello-Jira integration. This feature allows teams to execute projects with their preferred tool, and data automatically syncs between the platforms.
Jira’s abilities are so vast, it’s impossible to cover them all, but here are a few of Jira’s key features.
1. Workflows
Jira’s project management capabilities rely on workflows. These Jira workflows represent processes in your organization, and control the rules used to transition project tasks to different workflow stages.
For instance, tasks might begin in a pending stage. A task moves to an in-progress state when a team member works on it until the task reaches a completion stage, when the work is done.
Jira allows you to customize workflows to meet your organization’s needs. If a completed task needs to enter a review stage, you can add that step. Jira comes with default workflows to get you started, or download pre-built workflows from the Atlassian Marketplace.
2. Reports
All projects require reports to track progress and deliver actionable insights such as when your project is at risk of scope creep. Several out-of-the box Jira reports deliver these insights.
You can identify team members assigned too much work, discover project bottlenecks, and learn how long it’s taking to complete project tasks. And if Jira’s options aren’t enough, you can design your own reports. 3. Automation
Use Jira’s automation engine to automatically address repetitive tasks and processes, saving you and the project team time and effort. You define the rules that trigger automation actions, such as emailing the project manager when a task reaches completion.
Jira comes with built-in automation rule templates so you don’t have to start from scratch. The automation also works with third-party software you integrate from the Atlassian Marketplace, so these systems remain in sync with Jira.
How to use Jira for project management
Jira delivers a comprehensive suite of project management tools. Features are available for every project stage, from project creation to execution and completion. These five steps summarize Jira’s key capabilities along the project life cycle.
Step 1: Project configuration
Choose a Jira template to set up your project. Templates are a quick way to configure your project based on the processes used at your organization.
For instance, if your team employs kanban project management, pick the kanban template, and Jira will set up a default kanban board and workflows. You can then customize the default settings to match your team's needs. Step 2: Project plan
Every project requires planning. Jira offers the ability to sketch out a project plan for a time-based project, or a roadmap for ongoing, iterative projects such as software development.
To build your plan in Jira, start by defining project tasks. The heart of every project are its tasks. Use a work breakdown structure to identify the tasks to complete your project before entering them into Jira.
In Jira, tasks are called issues. They appear as digital cards holding the information required to complete the task.
Describe the task in the card.
Add documents or images that explain or elaborate task details.
Mark the most important tasks with a high priority.
Set due dates.
Break up larger items into sub-tasks.
Assign each task to a teammate, or put it in your project backlog to address when the time is right.
Once you’ve created your tasks in Jira, assemble them into your project plan, identifying and mapping dependencies to ensure these tasks don’t become blockers for your team.
Jira provides advanced project planning features that let you assemble multiple projects into one comprehensive plan, or you can keep projects separate.
The software also lets you create different project plan versions. This capability allows you to model out various scenarios to assess situations, such as worst- and best-case scenarios for your project.
Step 3: Team set up
With a plan in hand, it’s time to parse out work to initiate project execution. Before you can do that, every project teammate must be set up in Jira.
Not all project team members need equal Jira access. Some use Jira only to track work and complete tasks, while the Jira administrator configures Jira’s settings, connections to third-party apps, and other functions that require unlimited access.
This is where Jira’s permission schemes come into play. Permission schemes allow you to create a set of default permissions to apply to Jira users, saving time so you don’t have to implement permissions to users individually.
You can set permissions so that some individuals cannot view specific tasks. This feature is useful when employing contractors or other Jira users outside of your company to prevent them from viewing sensitive business information.
When your team is established in Jira, assign them tasks. Jira lets you monitor team capacity so you can assess if a person’s workload is too much or too little.
Step 4: Tracking
Jira offers several tools to track project progress. Time-tracking capabilities enable you to track the time each task takes. If Jira’s default time tracking features don’t meet your needs, go to the Atlassian Marketplace for third-party options.
Jira’s reports provide insights into team progress. Are tasks about to miss deadlines? Is a dependency going to cause a bottleneck? Jira’s reporting tools deliver the answers.
For greater visibility and convenience, customize Jira’s default dashboard to highlight the key information around your project. Add a calendar view, a pie chart breaking down status across all tasks, the work assigned to every team member, or swap out components throughout the project to make the dashboard work best for your needs.
Step 5: Project completion
Once a project reaches its goals and all tasks are completed, it’s time to wrap up the project. Jira offers two approaches. You can use its built-in archive function to close out a project and remove it from active use within the system.
Archiving a project means it’s no longer available to edit or to view except in Jira’s archived projects section.
You can also shut down permissions to a project so it’s read-only, preventing users from adding new tasks to a closed project while still enabling you to search for and view items in the project.
Final words about JIRA for project management
Jira’s rich feature set and ability to extend those capabilities through its marketplace make it a comprehensive project management tool. Jira pricing starts at free for teams up to 10 people. From there, pricing is on a per user basis depending on the desired Jira features.
Yet among the project management frameworks, Jira’s greatest strength lies in its scrum support. If your team uses the scrum approach, Jira is a great option. If not, a Jira alternative may work better.",Jira
Project Management,"What Is Jira? Jira is a project management tool that enables project managers to plan, assign, track and review projects in real time. Jira started its shelf life as a bug-tracking tool, so it is still the best project management tool for locating, tracking and recording bugs smoothly. Jira often gets discredited as being suitable only for developers but in addition to software development, the Jira platform supports projects of these types: Service management Work management Marketing HR Finance Design Personal Operations Legal Sales All projects are not created equal. The needs of a software development project would differ significantly from a human resources (HR) or operations project. To provide the necessary tools and templates for different types of projects for businesses of all sizes, Jira offers these four products: Jira Software: For planning, tracking, fixing and shipping world-class software Jira Service Management: Helps your customer care desk track and fix customer issues quickly and effectively Jira Work Management: Allows you to manage projects for any department within your organization, from marketing and recruitment to legal and operations Jira Align: Built for enterprises, it connects all the teams so that they can be on the same page and get real-time visibility into all the projects What Sets Jira Apart Jira was originally designed for software development and bug tracking. It has features that are customized to issue tracking and bug reporting. Hence, Jira is the best choice for software development teams. Jira software ships with an Agile flavor, which could be an additional advantage even for non-software projects. Agile methodology focuses on identifying and completing the most important tasks first so that the team delivers continuously and does not create a bottleneck. This is an approach that can help any non-IT project, whether it is a go-to-market or sales pipeline or recruitment and onboarding project. Pros Jira comes with two visually rich boards for tracking projects—Scrum and Kanban. If you wish to set deadlines and track progress of the project, according to those deadlines, Scrum is ideal for you. However, if you just want a visual way to look at your projects and tasks (issues in Jira), Kanban board is the way to go. Cons Jira is supposed to be more intuitive for developers in terms of its approach as well as labels used for tasks, events or custom fields. So non-developers may need to put in some effort initially to get used to the interface and its style of functioning. Also, for such a robust and feature-rich project management tool, it does not have any budgeting and invoicing features. Jira Core Features Let’s now dive into the core features offered by the Jira platform. Issue Management Anything that you need to track from start to finish is an issue in Jira. Every project is a collection of issues to be tracked. Issues are further broken down into stories and tasks so that large complex projects can be broken down into smaller manageable tasks that can be completed in sprints and delivered continuously. Agile Development Jira is built for Agile development. The software ships with Scrum, Kanban and bug-tracking boards so that development teams can choose a project depending on their requirement. Projects other than software development, such as Go To Market, Recruitment, Onboarding, Budgeting, etc., also benefit from these boards. Jira ships with two boards—Scrum and Kanban—that make managing sprints for fixing issues very intuitive. Issues themselves can be tracked and logged using multiple project views including user stories and story points. Bug Tracking Jira was originally developed to track bugs in the software development process. The software comes with a template dedicated to bug tracking, which makes it very simple to track, record and fix them. As all the issues can be viewed in a single board, bug fixing can be prioritized in a single click. Roadmaps Roadmaps enable stakeholders to appreciate the big-picture view of any project, taking in the overall progress at a glance. This high-level, visual summary of the project’s goals, timelines and priorities enables managers to prioritize critical tasks and focus on delivering the most valuable work first. Roadmaps also enable stakeholder alignment around project objectives, promoting transparent communication and accountability. You can even export them to other formats such as PDF or CSV for easy sharing. Reporting More than 15 reports can be created at every stage from planning and tracking issues to final delivery. These reports, such as a sprint report, control chart, resolution time report and time tracking report, help project managers gain actionable real-time insights into their team’s progress and re-prioritize accordingly. These data-driven visually rich reports can also be shared with clients to establish transparent communication channels. Role Assignment Features Although in the free plan, all users are administrators, for the paid plans, you can assign different roles to the users, such as developer, reporter and viewer. These roles are used to assign global and project-level permissions, customize notifications, establish email notification rules and more. Software Integrations Jira integrates with more than 3,000 integrations in over 35 categories ranging from project management and CRM to dependency management, security and workflow. To assist first-time users, Atlassian’s Ecosystem team highlights top apps that can be a great place for you to start exploring. Jira Setup and Customization When you sign up for Jira, you are sent a verifying link to your email. On checking that verifying link, you are redirected to a page where you need to create a workspace. Everything that you do in Jira happens in this workspace. All plans except Enterprise allow for just one workspace. After creating the workspace, Jira tries to collect some basic information about you and your team to set you up properly. These are questions about your team, role, whether you are experienced in Agile development or not, etc. You can of course choose to skip them for now. You can again integrate popular tools such as Slack, Google Sheets, MS Teams, GitHub, Jenkins, GitLab, etc. Or configure it later. You can choose to start from a template or a blank project. If you start with a template, it saves time and effort because it comes pre-configured with common workflows, issue types, project settings, custom fields and best practices specific to the type of project chosen. Starting with a blank project can be time-consuming. Jira Ease of Use Jira is highly intuitive if you are or have prior experience being a developer. For non-developers, it may take some initial effort, but it is worth it due to its Agile approach to project management. Also, for first-time users, it is advisable to start with templates that come pre-configured with workflows and best practices. Jira has enough templates to get you started with any type of project. Jira Security Jira allows you to create and customize user roles and permissions. It allows people from trusted networks only to access your software instance. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using AES-256. Jira is fully compliant with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), SOC 2 and 3, PCI/DSS, ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27018. For added security and compliance, you can subscribe to Atlassian Access, which includes single sign-on (SSO), system for cross-domain identity management (SCIM) and Active Directory sync. These services are part of the Enterprise plan. Jira Customer Service and Support Jira has a robust and in-depth self-service portal. You can access it from within the tool by clicking on the Quickstart button on the bottom right of your screen. It also has helpful short videos to get you started and answer any other questions you might have. Each support request is an issue tracked according to its priority level, determined by the inputs you gave while logging the issue. Some of the other fields include customer time zone, affected product, addressed customer comments and BRT escalation. Jira software provides 24/7 support via email and chat. Our support ticket was resolved in just over an hour. The best part was that its ticket receipt email was full of helpful links to webinars and knowledge center articles. Customizable Templates Jira has fully customizable templates for a wide range of projects from recruitment and onboarding to marketing and HR. You can customize the templates even after you have populated them with your own data. These templates come with pre-configured workflows and custom fields that follow the industry best practices for that project, which enables your team to hit the ground running. Guest/Client Access Jira user roles and permissions can be tweaked to provide guests or clients limited access to projects or issues. You can allow them global or project-level or issue-level permission, depending on their needs. Who is Jira Best For? If you need project management software for your information technology (IT) team, Jira is beyond doubt your best option. However, if you are willing to spend some time familiarizing yourself with the software, Jira is an excellent choice for any team that wants to adopt an Agile approach to completing tasks. If you have very basic project management requirements and work with a very small team, you can start with its forever-free plan for up to 10 users. As you grow in size and complexity, you can upgrade to paid plans. Even the free plan has many fully customizable templates for project management, marketing and sales and HR issues, which should be sufficient for a small business. Jira Pricing and Plans Jira has a forever free plan for 10 users, which is ideal for single teams with fundamental project management requirements. In Free and Standard plans, you can create single projects with basic roadmaps and dependency management. With Premium and Enterprise plans, you can create multiple projects with advanced roadmaps and dependency management. When the number of seats exceeds 800, opt for the Enterprise plan to unlock advanced features and functionality. Free Plan Jira’s Free plan is a good starting point for small teams of up to 10 members who need a project management tool but wish to avoid incurring any costs on it. All the users in the Free plan are administrators and project permissions, roles, issues and levels of security are not customizable. The plan provides 2GB of file storage for attachments and access to at least one community for support. Core Jira features such as customizable templates and automated workflows are available on the Free plan. Standard Plan Jira’s Standard plan offers more features compared to the Free plan and is perfect for growing teams whose project management and team collaboration requirements are not yet complex. The Standard plan allows up to 35,000 users to collaborate on a project on Jira software, 10,000 users on Jira work management and 5,000 agents on Jira service management platforms. These users can be managed efficiently with advanced permissions and multiple user roles. The Standard plan also includes audit logs that enable teams to keep track of important changes made to their Jira instance.

The Enterprise users need a single license to log in to all the instances (sites created on Jira cloud).",Jira
Project Management,"In today’s Jira review, we’re diving behind the scenes of one of the world’s most popular project management solutions. Designed for agile teams, Jira (by Atlassian) delivers streamlined task planning, tracking, and reporting tools to businesses of all sizes. It’s primarily used by software development teams, with specific tools for tracking software and app releases. However, virtually anyone can use Jira to prioritize and monitor workflows with Scrum and Kanban boards. We tested the free version of Jira’s project management tool to offer a comprehensive insight into the system’s features, benefits, and potential pitfalls. Quick Verdict and Pros & Cons If you’re looking for a quick take from our Jira review, we think this solution is excellent for software development teams searching for flexible, easy-to-use, and agile software. It integrates with many solutions, including Microsoft Teams, and there’s even a free plan to get you started. However, Jira might be complicated if you’re not running a software development company. Here’s a quick look at the pros and cons: Pros: Excellent focused features for software development Kanban boards and Scrum boards for agile sprints Easy to track, locate, and record bugs Fantastic security and compliance capabilities Great collaboration capabilities Integrated automation to save teams time Cons: Slightly complex interface for non-developers Missing certain features (like Gantt charts) Jira Review: The Key Features Jira is a project management tool targeted at agile software development teams. It was designed by Atlassian, who is also responsible for another popular task management tool: Trello. Jira started life as a bug-tracking tool for software teams before evolving into a fully-featured suite. Jira features many of the project management capabilities of other competing tools, like boards, timeline views, and reporting solutions, but there are some bonus capabilities, too. The core features include: Boards and Timelines The first thing we looked at in our Jira review were the boards and timeline tools it offers to help you manage and track task projects. The “timelines” give you interactive tools for monitoring dependencies, setting deadlines, and tracking release dates in a calendar-style view. The boards give you various ways to organize your team and resources. There are two types of boards available in Jira: Scrum boards: Ideal for agile teams working in sprints or time-focused periods. Kanban boards: Drag-and-drop boards for managing the flow of work In Jira, you can create multiple boards for each project, displaying different issues, workstreams, and information. You can also design cross-project boards with summaries for supervisors and leaders. Projects and Planning Projects in Jira are a collection of tasks you need to manage to achieve specific outcomes. Jira gives users a highly configurable environment, which they can customize to suit any team’s working style. Within any project, you can track issues, bugs, people, and workflows in a convenient space with dynamic visualizations. Jira even gives you a range of “templates” to start with. Jira’s projects can also be broken down into various types, such as team- and company-managed projects. Whichever option you choose, you’ll get access to excellent configuration features and an easy-to-use interface. Jira also offers access to “Plans” with some subscription packages. These pages draw data from projects, boards, and other aspects of Jira to create a customizable interface. They act like a sandbox environment for planning and experimenting in Jira. Bug & Issue Tracking One thing that sets Jira apart from other project management tools, like Monday.com, is its focus on software development. To help you keep track of potential issues with your software, you can monitor problems and “tag” them in your projects with different priority levels. Jira makes it easy to categorize “issues” into different segments based on the work needed. Plus, you can create a set of “sub-tasks” for each issue. You can also monitor each issue’s “development status” in real-time. Workflows and Automation We were particularly impressed by the workflow management and automation options in our Jira review. In the software, you can design comprehensive workflows for each team member using a simple drag-and-drop editor. This makes it easy to map out every project stage for your employees, from initial creation to approval and more. You can even design entire roadmap visualizations that help stakeholders see the “big picture” of a project at a glance, with timelines, goals, and priorities. You can also automate tasks with a simple no-code rule builder to save team members time. Jira makes setting triggers and conditions for each automated workflow easy, with comprehensive controls and conditions, branching options, and more. Reports, Dashboards, and Insights Like most leading project management tools, Jira ensures you can collect data from your projects. There are various customizable reports, including agile reports, DevOps reports, issue analysis reports, and forecasts. You can also design real-time dashboards. These dashboards are collections of data displays that show you real-time information at a glance. Like reports, you can configure these dashboards to display the data that matters most to you. Alongside dashboards and reports, you also get Jira’s “Insights.” These pre-configured reports help you make data-driven decisions about sprints, backlogs, common issues, and project progress. Integrations One of the best things about using Jira for Project Management is that it works seamlessly with many other tools. There are more than 3000 different “Jira software apps” you can add to your system for extra features. Jira software integrates with various collaboration, UCaaS, and other tools through the Atlassian marketplace. You can connect Jira to solutions like Google Workspace, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. You can even link your CRM technology to Jira so the platform can access insights about your customers and their journeys with your software. Atlassian Intelligence One particularly exciting new feature of Jira is the “Atlassian Intelligence” solution, which is included in some project management plans. This AI tool can generate and transform content, summarize content for you, and simplify workflows. It’s a generative AI tool developed internally by Atlassian using OpenAI software. You can use it in the Jira project management tool and other Atlassian solutions to create automation, search for answers, automate support, and more. It can even help you review code. Jira Review: Pricing and Plans Now, we come to one of the most essential parts of our Jira review: the pricing. The good news is that you can access the basic features of Jira for free for up to 10 users. The forever-free plan includes unlimited project boards, backlog and timeline insights, and reporting. Plus, you get 2GB of storage, but you’ll only be able to access support from the Jira community. Paid plans include: Standard: $8.15 per month per user: Up to 3,500 users, roles and permissions, audit logs, data residency, 250GB of storage, and business hour support. Premium: $16 per month per user: The features of Standard, plus Atlassian intelligence AI, advanced roadmaps, custom issue hierarchy, sandbox tools, and unlimited storage. You also get 24/7 premium support from the Jira team. Enterprise: Custom pricing with all the features of Premium, plus support for multiple sites, centralized security controls and subscriptions, and enterprise support. Jira Review: Ease of Use and Customization As we noted earlier in this Jira review, the platform is a little complex if you’re unfamiliar with agile workflows or developer tech. It’s still reasonably easy to get started, however. After you create a workspace with Jira, the system will collect information about you and your team to help you configure the software to your needs. You can also immediately connect your Jira project management software to other apps you’re using in this setup process, such as Google Sheets and Slack. Once you’re ready to start managing projects, you can use templates to get you started. We recommend using this approach, as starting from a blank page can be daunting for new users. It takes a little time to get used to the project management experience on Jira, but once you’ve figured out how everything works, you shouldn’t have much trouble. The interface is laid out to help you jump between sections quickly. Plus, we loved the tutorials on the platform to show you how different features work. The biggest downside is that much of the documentation available for Jira includes a lot of industry jargon and buzzwords. Plus, some of the words Jira uses to describe its features can be complicated. For instance, “tasks” are referred to as “issues”. Jira Review: Security, Compliance, and Support Since you’ll be managing a lot of data in your Jira project management tool, it’s essential to ensure that compliance and security features align with your needs. Fortunately, Jira does take plenty of steps to protect your business and data. All your information is encrypted at rest and in transit using AES-256. Plus, the system complies with GDPR, SOC 2 and 3, PCI/DSS, ISO/IEC 27001, and 27018. You also get access to two-factor authentication for better user protection and support for SSO. However, it’s worth remembering that Atlassian may track some of your actions on the app. This is pretty common, but if you’re concerned, you might want to check their approach to user privacy. From a customer support perspective, we were pretty impressed by Jira’s approach. An in-depth self-service portal is packed with short videos and guides to help you get started. Plus, you can access 24/7 support straight from Jira’s team via email and chat. Notably, however, the level of support you get and the speed of your response will vary depending on your chosen pricing plan.",Jira
Project Management,"What Is Jira?
Probably needless to say (still, let’s stick to a proper introduction), Jira is a software application used for project management and issue tracking.
The tool, developed by the Australian software company Atlassian, has become widely used by agile development teams to manage their work. Still, is Jira really the most optimal Agile project management tool?
Sure enough, Atlassian promotes Agile project management by including both Scrum and Kanban boards into Jira projects. However, they are neither the creators of this approach nor did they build Jira specifically around it.
The fact is, there are no native features to support some of the basic agile practices. The good news? Jira allows for full-scale customizations.
With more than 5,000 apps available on the Atlassian Marketplace, you have the flexibility to implement literally any project management method in Jira.
Jira Use Cases
Jira is flexible enough to help different types of teams manage their work. What was originally a bug and issue tracker has now evolved into a tool used to test and deploy software products, provide customer support, and manage non-IT projects.
•	Jira for agile teams. Jira works great for teams who practice Agile methodologies. It makes it easy for team members to visualize workflows and track their progress in real-time.
•	Jira for software development teams. Jira is a popular choice among engineering teams as it can be used for every stage of the software development journey.
•	Jira for test case management. Jira enables QA teams to test software effectively and iteratively. Some of the most popular features for this use case are customized screens and workflows that automate the testing process.
•	Jira for project management teams. As an all-rounder tool, Jira can be set up to fit any project type. Marketing, sales, and legal teams can use Jira just as effectively as software teams.
Pros and Cons of Using Jira
Even though Jira is one of the most popular project management tools in the market, it comes with its strengths and weaknesses. Let’s break them down.
Jira Pros
•	Integration. Probably the biggest pro of using Jira is that it allows easy integration with other 3rd party applications.
•	Visualization. Jira is a great tool for visualizing your work items. It is especially effective when your work is moving through multiple teams.
•	Customization. Jira is extremely customizable. You’ll be able to tailor a Jira workflow to every process you support.
Jira Cons
•	Long learning curve. Jira is not immediately intuitive to a new user. It usually requires a lot of learning and that comes with additional cost and time investment.
•	Lack of standardization. Jira provides a lot of bells and whistles. If you don’t have an established approach to organizing your work, the more you grow, the harder it will become to maintain your system.
•	Reporting. Even though Jira provides a set of predefined reports, they are not enough to manage your workflows effectively and make the most of your improvement efforts. More on this in just a moment so bear with me here!
The 3 Best Features of Jira
Let’s explore some of the best Jira features you can leverage to facilitate teamwork and get your work done in the most efficient manner.
Work in Progress Limits
The ability to set up WIP limits on your columns in Jira by far is one of the most powerful Jira features.
Why? Adopting this practice will enable your team to immediately switch their focus from starting new work to finishing outstanding work (and ultimately getting more things done!).
Work In Progress (WIP) limits are just that, limits on the number of issues that can be “In Progress” at any one time. A WIP limit should be applied to each work in progress state in your workflow.
Once the WIP limit has been reached, no new work items should enter that state until one of the outstanding items is completed.
WIP limits keep your work from getting stuck before completion. It’s a common pitfall for a busy team. When outstanding tasks must be cleared out first, the whole team is able to focus on resolving the issues in your workflow first.
Flagging an Issue
Even though Jira flags haven’t been developed specifically to indicate issues as blocked, that’s how this feature is most commonly used.
Visualizing and emphasizing your blocked work should be an essential part of your agile practices. This is because managing blockers effectively helps you improve service delivery by avoiding the same impediments from recurring.
Remember, a blocked work item is still an in-progress work item, a commitment, a piece of value your customers are waiting for. So make sure to use a Jira flag to mark the card you’re unable to continue working on and treat blocked work the same way you treat the rest of your work. This way, you will encourage an early and swift resolution of blockers standing in the way of oncoming work.
Now, you might be wondering, okay, Sonya why can’t we just create a blocked column instead?
I understand where this is coming from. Actually, I’ve been there before! If you’re eager to learn from my experience, here are the three mistakes I made by introducing a dedicated blocked column (+ what I learned from them!) →
Automation
The automation engine in Jira can be especially useful when it comes to enforcing explicit process policies.
What do I mean by that? Think about what you should do when a high-priority item enters the workflow or how you should deal with any bugs popping up as the work moves forward.
In Agile project management, we set rules that the team follows to move the work towards completion. We call these explicit policies. These policies dictate what should happen in different scenarios in order to ensure that the tasks move smoothly through the process.
There are two main goals that come with this concept. Firstly, we give teams the autonomy to handle different situations on their own (especially emergencies). And secondly, the policies are specifically designed to optimize our delivery workflow for predictability.
Use automation to configure the way your Jira system should behave in certain scenarios following your process policies.
For example, say you have an explicit policy that requires team members to escalate issues with a due date in less than five days. You can set an automation rule that searches for issues that match this criterion and sends a Slack message to your team requesting a follow-up.
Want to take this concept a step further? Here’s how to set and manage your explicit process policies →
The 3 Worst Jira Features
Now that we’ve gone through some of the best features Jira has to offer, let’s take a look at the features that are… not so great.
Time Tracking Jira Feature
The time tracking feature in Jira lets your team record the time they spend working on an issue.
Here is the thing. Unless you track billable time, this feature is useless. Time tracking does not lead to improvements in your delivery performance. This is due to one simple reason – time spent at a desk doesn’t necessarily translate into productive time.
Productivity metrics should focus on achievements and outcomes rather than clocked hours.
Instead of tracking time, measure the basic flow metrics – cycle time, throughput, and work in progress, and optimize the predictability of your delivery process.
By focusing on your main flow metrics, you’ll be able to keep delivery times down, improve your customer satisfaction, and sustain high levels of employee engagement and motivation.
Issues Estimation Jira Feature
Here’s the description provided by Jira regarding the issues estimation feature: “Estimating stories in your backlog helps you predict how long it would take you to deliver certain portions of the backlog. Note that this discussion refers to the best practices we’ve implemented as the main path in Jira Software.”.
Estimating issues using relative complexity measurement won’t help you predict how long it will take to deliver your work, and here is why.
Making delivery commitments based on judgment or gut feeling is not reliable. To be able to deliver on time, you need an approach based on facts, rather than intuition.
Predictions based on effort, made either by counting hours (or story points), can land you in hot water, not only because they are subjective but also because they don’t take into account the time your work spends waiting in our delivery workflow.
And the waiting time in your workflow would usually represent between 60% and 95% of your delivery times!
So, instead of estimating your work, use your past performance data to forecast when you’ll be done. This approach takes into account all the waiting time in your workflow and is faster, cheaper and much more reliable than estimating!
Performance Reporting Jira Features
Even though Jira provides a set of reports for agile teams like sprint velocity and burndown charts, some of the most pressing questions remain unanswered.
•	How to determine the amount of work you can commit to in the next release? Jira doesn’t provide a data-driven approach to deal with this question.
•	What is slowing you down? Where is the bottleneck in the system that’s preventing you from hitting your targets? There is no report that clearly states which part of the process set you off track.
•	Where are the opportunities for improvement? How do you inspect and adapt? You can certainly talk about what went well and what went wrong in the past 2 weeks but what’s the data-driven approach that will help you make an objective decision?
The Kanban method gives a straightforward answer to these questions. More and more Scrum teams realize the benefits of adopting Kanban to manage their work more effectively. And the benefits are countless.
Adopting practices from both worlds is a very effective strategy, one that will provide your business with a strong competitive edge.",Jira

Project Management,"Project management is a complicated process where multiple participants working together, including product managers, designers, developers, QA, marketing, sales and more. Many participants and tasks need a tool which helps organizing a work. Jira is the perfect solution.
Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development methodology for managing product development. Each iterative cycle is called sprint. Each sprint usually takes 2 weeks and all the remaining tasks will be pushed to the next cycle.
Development team usually starts with a sprint planning meeting and then workout features that need to be done in the current sprint. And then the team leader or project manager will assign the tickets to each person depending on their capabilities.
Why Strut Digital use JIRA to manage most of the projects?
1. Transparency
The transparency JIRA provides is great. Each task is clearly assigned to each individual person, all team member is able to know who is doing what.
2. Flexibility
During product development, it is very common to have any changes occurred because some factors haven’t been accounted for in the sprint planning session. While using JIRA, any team member can create a new ticket if they think it is necessary. When ticket is assigned to a person, that person will get an email notification straightaway so there is no chance that team members would miss any of the tasks.
3. User Experience
The drag and drop feature JIRA offers is also one of the reasons why we choose it at the first place. Team member can drag each ticket and drop it into any of the process step.
4. Commenting
Commenting is another good feature which JIRA provides, it allows the team members to easily collaborate with each other. Especially for a global enterprise, people within the same team could be in different time zone which makes them impossible to work efficiently
5. Cost management
JIRA is also great for project managers who has a tight schedule. Team member can put down the story point for each task, it offers a way to estimate the project budget and a burndown chart can be generated to predict if the project is going to meet the deadline, so the key stakeholders would be able to make the right decision and adjust the project scope.
6. Categorisation
JIRA is also able to categorise each ticket into epics, this helps project manager to split all tickets into components and then track them down instead of lots of small tickets.
7. Custom Workflow
Workflow in the JIRA board can be easily customized; it can be applied to other industries other than IT as long as the project has a definable workflow. In Strut Digital, a typical workflow would be To Do -> Sprint -> QA -> Done. QA is usually done by people outside the development team.
8. Integrations
There are many plugins and integrations which can be used in conjunction with JIRA. For example, we are using Harvest with JIRA to record the timesheet and bill our clients.
It is also very easy to use JIRA with other Atlassian products such as Confluence to provide Documentation, BitBucket to host code repositories. In conclusion, JIRA provides great functionalities and tools to manage projects. Clear project progress and cost management can be exported easily with a few simple clicks. Clean UI/UX design, highly customisable workflow and rich integration support make it easily adaptable to any type of projects.",Jira

Project Management,"What Is Notion? Notion is a cloud-based productivity and collaboration all in-one workspace tool. In this article, I’ll answer the question ‘what is Notion?’ and provide some examples of how it can be used for productivity, real-time collaboration, and project management in your organization. Notion allows small teams of people to work together in real-time on documents, tasks, notes, wikis, and databases from different devices. For example, you could create a Notion workspace where your team will work on a project. The workspace can be used to store all the documentation related to the project. And team members can update the documents in real-time together.
Advertisement
In addition to being a productivity tool, Notion can be used for project management. For example, you could create a task list, a calendar for important events, a Kanban board to track the status of projects, and databases for work management.
The Notion app competes with other productivity and collaboration platforms. There are many Notion alternatives, like Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Asana, Monday.com, Trello, ClickUp, note-taking app Evernote, and the list goes on. Notion is primarily an app that works in your web browser but there is also a mobile app available for iOS and Android.
One of the key differences between Notion and Microsoft Teams, is that Notion allows you to freely organize to-do lists, databases, calendars, documents, and other components on a single page. This is in contrast to Microsoft 365, where apps like Planner and Lists are siloed from each other. Although that is gradually changing in Microsoft 365 as Loop components are introduced to Outlook and Teams. But more on that later. How does Notion work?
When you first log in to Notion, it can be hard to know where to start if you don’t understand how the platform is designed to work conceptually. Documents, to-do lists, and other Notion components are organized in workspaces and pages. You can create more than one workspace. In a workspace, you can create one or more pages that contain ‘blocks’. Advertisement
Blocks
Each block contains some kind of data or media component. At the simplest level, a block can be a paragraph of text. Or it could be a media item, like an image or uploaded PDF document. There are many different types of components that can constitute a block in Notion. Here are a few key features:
A to-do list
A heading (H1, H2 etc.)
A table
A bulleted list
A database in table, board, list, or gallery view
An image or video
Embedded media content from other platforms like GitHub, Loom, OneDrive, Google Drive, Miro, Jira, Slack, and many other integrations. Is Notion for free?
Notion has a free plan to get you started. But it is limited to the number of blocks you can create and some features, like adding groups or team members are not available on the free plan. There are three paid plans:
Plus (formerly Team)
Business
Enterprise

It’s a versatile productivity app that lets you collaborate with others and boost your productivity. How it works: Notion works like a blank canvas with blocks that are building blocks of everything in it, such as text, images, videos, to-do lists, tables, and databases. By arranging and connecting these blocks, you can create pages, projects, or even entire systems tailored to your needs. Who uses it? Individuals: Notion is suitable for individuals such as writers, students, freelancers, and entrepreneurs who are looking for a streamlined organization system.
Teams: businesses can use Notion for collaborative project management, knowledge sharing, and internal wikis.

Project Management,"10 Reasons Why You Might Want to Try Notion (& 5 Reasons Why You Might Not)
If you’re at all interested in productivity, you’ve probably heard of the Notion app. I’ve gushed about it more than a few times, and I’ve mentioned before that I use it to organize all of my writing. The Notion app is touted as an all-in-one workspace and is a very simple, but very powerful tool. Notion is great for students, writers, and content creators, and it has been completely transformative in how I organize my life and get my work done.
Just in case you weren’t convinced by my repeatedly glowing recommendations, I decided to outline some of the reasons why you might want to give Notion a try. But as with anything, Notion has its drawbacks, and I’ve listed a few of the big ones here.
Before you decide if you want to use Notion, I want you to have a good idea of just what Notion is (and isn’t) capable of.
10 Reasons Why You Should Use Notion
1. Notion is Free
It’s one of the most powerful productivity tools out there right now, and you can use it right away without paying a penny. Of course, they have a tiered subscription service, because that is the industry standard these days, but even on a free plan you get unlimited blocks and pages.
For context, a page is like a note in Evernote or a document in Google docs – it is your blank workspace, and the blocks are each piece of content that you add to it – each paragraph, image, heading, or table – all of these are individual blocks, and you can have as many blocks on a page as you need.
There are some limitations on file sizes should you choose to upload images and the like to your pages, but I’ve been using the free plan for a few months now, and the limit (so far) has not impeded me. There is also a system set up to help you earn credits so you can give the paid versions a try without spending anything.
2. Notion is an All-in-One Tool
It is truly unbelievable how many different ways Notion can be customized to suit your needs. Besides the obvious (ie. Spreadsheets, Notetaking), users have customized Notion to work as a planner, a journal, a habit tracker, a PowerPoint presentation, a blog, a landing page and so much more.
The tools at your disposal are fairly straightforward: tables, headings, text, checkboxes – but with the clever application of things like linked databases and synced blocks, you can create just about anything you want.
The argument has been made that Notion can do everything, but that means it will never be the best at anything. Whether or not this is true, for users who like to have everything in a single place, Notion might be exactly what you’re looking for.
3. Clean UI
One of the things that appealed to me most about Notion, especially when I was looking at other workspaces, was the amount of white space. Notion looks clean. It is uncluttered. There are no toolbars at the top or bottom, and the sidebar can disappear, leaving you with open space – just you and the cursor, ready for writing (or note-taking)
For years I’ve used things like Evernote and Scrivener, and while I love those tools for other reasons, I’ve found that I work best in a clean and distraction-free space.
4. Templates
One of my favourite features is the ability to create templates for things you repeatedly use. This is especially functional for content creators who frequently need the same sort of material – social media posts, blog posts, keywords, newsletters – things you are constantly having to create to build your brand. You can create a template one time, with everything you need, and every time you make a new page in that database, you can select one of these templates. And you can edit them at any time to better suit your needs.
For example, I have a template for story ideas, blog posts, Instagram posts, and the like. I don’t have to build the same page from scratch every time. I click on the template, and it’s ready.
5. Page Customization
While it might seem fairly basic at first glance, if you’ve seen any of the aesthetic notion boards out there, you’ll see just how powerful the customization can be. You can make as many columns of content as you like, add as much media as you please, and change around the location and sizes of any of these elements at will. You can also lock a page when you are satisfied so you don’t accidentally move something you shouldn’t have.
This is where you can really tailor Notion to suit your needs, creating pages and headings to organize whatever it is you want to organize. You can also include databases, checklists and more!
6. Linked Databases
What makes Notion powerful is the database feature. It operates like a basic spreadsheet, with cells you fill with information in what Notion calls “properties”. For each entry in the database, you can assign certain properties which allow you to organize that table with Notion’s sort and filter functions.
What makes this especially powerful is when you create new instances of that database, each with its own specific filter and sort. From a master database, you can split everything up into tasks, notes, and more. This is how my Notion functions – it all stems from a single master database from which new links and instances are created.
But it doesn’t just end there – you can create properties that link to other databases, or even within the same database, threading together your information. This means when you pull up any page from your table, you can access all other related notes and information. It’s extremely powerful when you are writing and/or researching and so helpful if you are the type to lose track of notes and information, even in a digital space.
While I haven’t dabbled in it much, you can also write formulas, as you would in a normal Excel spreadsheet, so that you can add information into one “cell” or property and the formula will fill related properties accordingly.
7. Sharing
This is the part that I think has made Notion so incredibly popular – the ability to share our workspaces and templates. Every Notion page can be shared, and thus anyone can “duplicate” that page to their own workspace and use it themselves – all of the databases, templates and filters intact. A blogger or student can create a detailed and visually appealing dashboard with all of the necessary elements done for you, and from there you can tweak and customize to better suit your needs.
This way, a lot of the work is done for you. It’s also a lot of fun to share your dashboard with others! I listed a bunch on my post detailing how I use notion for writing, but I’ll link a few of my favourites below so you can take a look.
8. Embedding and Integrations
Notion is powerful all on its own but you can also use embeds and integrations – essentially widgets – that further enhance its functionality. Things like automation, forms, and even turning Notion into a blog are done through these various integrations.
Notion is already able to embed a variety of things, like tweets, maps, and pdfs, but with these third-party apps, you can include things like weather, Spotify playlists, and Pomodoro timers to really create an all-in-one experience on your Notion homepage. The website Apption.co has a ton of Notion embeds for you to try and further customize your digital dashboard.
9. Team Collaboration
Even on a free plan, you can have up to five users in the same workspace. For small study groups, content creators, writers and editors, you’re able to share and work within the same space under guest profiles. With guest profiles, you can control what they can see and edit, but guests cannot add new pages. This can also be useful if you are working with clients or have an assistant to delegate tasks to.
If you are a business owner who requires your team to have more access, you can include members but that requires a paid plan.
10. Mobile Functionality
Maybe it speaks to a bigger issue around hustle culture and our obsession with productivity, but at this point, I require any of the apps I use to have a mobile version, ideally with as much functionality as the original. In that regard, Notion delivers.
While a narrow screen means that some elements (tables, calendars) are squished and not as viable, for the most part, the mobile Notion app has all of the functionality of the Web version or desktop app, so you can do all the same work. It’s fast and responsive, and surprisingly easy to use, considering all of the features Notion has under the hood. When the bulk of your workspace is occupied by a single app, the mobile experience must be as seamless a transition as possible.
As a caveat, I use a fairly high-spec phone, so you’re mileage may vary depending on your particular mobile device.
It’s no surprise that I am a big fan of this program. It truly has changed the way I work and the way I organize in a way that I did not expect a single program to be capable of. It’s been a huge relief to me to know I have a system that supports my creative process.
But it’s not perfect. Nothing is, and Notion is no exception. As much as I love Notion, it does have some serious flaws which might ruin your experience, and I thought I’d go through what I think are the worst offenders.
5 Reasons Why You Might Not Want to Use Notion
1. The Learning Curve
When you first open your Notion dashboard, you can start writing immediately, especially if that is what you are using it for, but in order to create those pretty dashboards and databases, you will need to spend a significant portion of time learning the software and setting it up.
This is why templates are so handy, as they do much of the work for you, but it’s still a good idea to learn how to use Notion, if only so you don’t accidentally break your template. Learning how to organize it in a way that suits your needs will take time and no small amount of trial and error.
It can be very intimidating when you factor in embedded content, linked databases, and formulas. You don’t need these to make use of Notion, but they are powerful and lend a lot of functionality to the software – if you want to use Notion to its fullest, you will have to take the time to learn how to use it.
2. No Offline Mode
This is a tough one. As of writing this, Notion is online only. It isn’t stored locally on your computer, and you need an internet connection to access all of your work. This presents a few problems.
Firstly, is that if your internet goes out, you can’t get anything done. Unless you already have the page open on your computer, you are out of luck. You won’t be able to access any tasks or drafts beyond what you might have left up beforehand.
Second, if there is a problem with the Notion servers, you are once again out of luck. Until they get everything up and working again, you won’t have access to anything in your Notion workspace, which can really ruin your work day.
3. The Desktop App May Require Resets
I always prefer to use desktop apps where available, as it makes me far less likely to refresh Instagram or check my emails. The Notion app works just like the web service, with the handy addition that I can’t load up a chrome tab and end up in an internet rabbit hole.
For the last few months I’ve used it and it worked just fine, until one day I pulled it up and nothing would load. The screen was empty, and at first, I suspected it was a connectivity issue. Several tests later, I realized my internet was fine, but Notion still would not load.
Naturally, I took to google and discovered that you may need to occasionally “reset” your Notion app. I use Windows, so this just meant I had to clear the Notion folder in my roaming data.
For some, this might not be a big issue, but it is an extra step, and not something I would expect from an otherwise a clean and hassle-free user experience. I’m also significantly more tech-savvy than most, and this might be a more difficult step for those who aren’t as familiar with the inner workings of their computer.
4. The BackUp Situation
With no local files, you probably want to keep some sort of export of your Notion as a backup if there is data you need to access should your internet, or Notion itself, go down. As a writer, there is nothing more important than keeping backups, and thankfully, Notion allows you to do that.
With some caveats.
The first is that if you want a pdf export that includes all the subpages (and not just the page you are currently working on), you need to be on the enterprise plan. Either that or you can export each page one at a time, but that sounds like a lot of work when you have a lot of pages. Locking it behind a paywall is understandable, but as the enterprise plan is meant for companies, it’s not really financially viable for the average writer or content creator.
Notion does allow you to create backups that include subpages as HTML or markdown, but if you have a bunch of nested pages, you’ll end up with a zip file that only gives you an error message. The reason for this is the file names, which are apparently too long for Windows (thus, the error message). There are some workarounds – 7zip, for instance, will allow you to open it as normal (and if necessary, change file names).
At the end of the day, the backup process you get with Notion is considerably more involved than it is with many of it’s competitors, who offer a far more seamless solution, especially when Notion is touted as an all-in-one tool.
5. Limited Formatting
Visually, you have a limited experience with Notion. You have the same set of ten colours, three fonts, the usual formatting tools (bold, italicize, underline), and that’s about it. Every page can have a single icon and a header image, and you are free to add as many images as you like (or up to 5mb, if you are using the free plan)
If you don’t like the colours and fonts that Notion provides, then you might not enjoy looking at it every day. It can feel particularly limiting when everything else feels so customizable. If you like to have the full breadth of Windows fonts and a colour wheel to choose from, you might find Notion unappealing.
Not a deal-breaker by any means, but a lot of the community is focused on making aesthetic dashboards as an impetus for using the program, and if you don’t think it looks good – you might not use it.",Notion
Project Management,"Why is Notion one of my favorite productivity tools?
1. Flexibility of a Paper Notebook
Notion offers highly customizable layouts. While writing in a notebook, there is no restriction on how you want to write and where you want to write.
Notion replicates a notebook.
The layouts are built from blocks which are like Lego pieces. Each block offers features necessary to take notes like creating a list, highlight, and more. One of the best features is toggle blocks where all the information is collapsible in one place.
It offers creating nested subpages at multiple levels. It also gives the option to change any word into a nested page.
The makers of Notion have ensured that there is less friction while typing. A simple forward slash can embed new blocks. This removes the need to remember lots of keyboard shortcuts.
2. Project and Task Management In One Place
One interface for everything.
The interface to take notes can also be used for a variety of project management tasks like a Kanban Board, To-Do List, and a lot more. Nesting is a powerful feature of Notion and nesting of subtasks is possible. Rearranging the blocks can create any type of layout you need.
From looking at the big picture to focusing on the details is possible in no time. Multiple views like Table, List, Calendar are available to look at all the data in different cuts. The option to set up custom views using multi-criteria filters is also available.
Switching to different projects in the workspace is effortless. All the projects can also be accessed easily from a sidebar on the left. No matter which location you are in the current project. it is easy to switch to another project in no time.
3. Digital Brain to Store, Organize, Share information
Store Information:
Notion is not just a note-taking app. It is a tool to organize digital life. It helps by storing all the files and notes in one place. It works as a flexible database where PDFs, images, and other files can be embedded. Notion web clipper can also save any webpage to your workspace.
Organize with ease:
These files can then be easily organized according to their themes/usage.
Share them:
Easily add people who can access the data or publish it to the web for anyone with the link to access.
4. Thriving Community of Early Adopters
The growth of Notion can be attributed to its power users.
Customized templates:
Tons of pre-defined templates available both by Notion and enthusiasts. It helps to create faster and better page layouts. A Google search with the type of template one needs will fetch thousands of results.
A few popular use cases include — meeting notes, finance & budgeting, personal website, resume, habit trackers.
Notion Ambassadors:
Notion has a learning curve which might be a hindrance for new users. Notion overcomes this with the help of Ambassadors. They are neither paid nor given any preference in the hiring process at Notion. Yet people take pride in becoming an ambassador of Notion. This shows how much people love Notion and feel part of the community and give back to it. Such advocates are a dream for any product.
5. Free for Personal Use
Almost all the freemium tools I have used have at some point asked to subscribe to their premium offering. However, Notion is free to use without ever being pushed to buy the premium version. There are never any promotional emails or big banners inside the tool.
The free version doesn’t have ads as well. The free plan is more than enough for my usage. To use perks like unlimited file uploads, version history, and a few more, one must opt for the paid plan. If it comes to a purchasing decision, I would likely upgrade to a paid plan. The engagement with the product is high and so is the cost of switching to other tools.
6. Delightful User Experience
The interface is clean, minimalistic, and pleasing to look at. Even for being an all-in-one workspace, it is surprisingly clutter-free. This article on Figma’s official blog explains how they achieved it.
Rearranging the blocks is the ultimate feature of Notion. It is with a simple drag & drops the layouts can be rearranged in multiple ways. Notion gives unmatched flexibility. It is fun to organize projects and layouts.

Project Management,"What Is Microsoft Project? Uses, Features and Pricing
Microsoft Project has been the most popular project management software for years. That’s mainly because project managers and team members were used to other Microsoft products, not necessarily because Microsoft Project is the best choice.
While there have been challenges to its rule, and many who have surpassed it, Microsoft remains a giant in this industry. No discussion of project management software would be complete without including Microsoft Project.
What Is Microsoft Project?
Microsoft Project is project management software that’s used to create schedules, project plans, manage resources and keep track of time. It has features such as Gantt charts, kanban boards and project calendars for project management professionals.
Microsoft Project is also known by other names such as MS Project or Project Professional, which is the software’s current official name. There are also other Microsoft Project products with similar names such as Project Online, Project Server and Project for the Web. You can access those products by acquiring a Microsoft Project Plan subscription, which has three pricing tiers to choose from.
If you’re looking for a less expensive and more flexible project management software, there’s ProjectManager, work and project management software that’s collaborative and lets you work how you please. Unlike Microsoft Project, we offer a collaborative, intuitive platform with multiple project views—managers can plan projects on Gantt charts or the sheet view while teams can use kanban boards, calendars or robust task lists to manage their work. Get started today for free.
Microsoft Project Views
Like ProjectManager, Microsoft Project offers multiple views for project managers and teams though its platform is not nearly as collaborative. Here’s a simple description of MS Project’s offered views.
•	Grid View: A project view that is used to plan and manage projects with a task list.
•	Board View: A visual kanban board view that helps with managing workflow and status.
•	Timeline View: The traditional Gantt chart is used for scheduling tasks over a project timeline.
Microsoft Project Features
There are plenty of features that project managers and their teams need to better manage their work and MSP has a number of them. However, to get a full picture, here’s a list of the key features available to customers who are willing to pay the price.
•	Project Planning: Use Gantt charts and kanban boards to plan work. Microsoft Project’s planning features are much more robust than those of Microsoft Planner.
•	Communication & Collaboration: Teams can work together on projects. Alternatively, you can use Microsoft Teams for a more cost-effective communication solution.
•	Coauthoring: Stakeholders and team members work together to edit and update task lists and schedules.
•	Reporting: Pre-built reports that can track progress, resources, programs and portfolios.
•	Roadmap: Track programs and project portfolios.
•	Timesheets: Collect project and non-project time for payroll and invoicing.
•	Resource Management: Manage resources by requesting and assigning tasks.
Plans and Pricing
Microsoft Project evolved from desktop software to a subscription-based product portfolio. You can choose between three monthly license plans: Project Plan 1, project plan 3 and Project Plan 5. Here’s a quick overview of what you get with these plans.
•	Desktop Version: To get the on-premises version of Microsoft Project, you’ll need to pay $679.99 for Project Standard 2021 and $1,129.99 for Project Professional 2021.
•	Project Plan 1: For $10 per user per month, you only get to use Project Home, and Project for the web. Two light versions of Project Professional and Project Online. This is mostly recommended for team members.
•	project plan 3: For $30 per user per month, you get to use a package that’s sufficient to manage projects, but has no project portfolio management features. You can use the desktop client Microsoft Project and Project Online.
•	Project Plan 5: For $55 per user per month, this is everything Microsoft Project has to offer: Project for the web, Project Online and Desktop client.
Many argue that this pricing structure is not convenient for many teams because prices can go up exponentially as you add team members. There are many Microsoft Project alternatives in the market such as ProjectManager, which have the same project portfolio management features for less.
Pros and Cons of Microsoft Project
Nothing is perfect. Even Microsoft Project has its drawbacks. If you’re thinking of trying it for yourself, take a moment to consider its pros and cons.
Pros
•	One of the biggest pros is that it’s a Microsoft product so it integrates with the company’s other products including Office 365, Skype and Sharepoint.
•	It has a similar interface to other MS products.
•	It’s been around for a long time, and its features have developed over time.
•	It’s part of Microsoft and has the reliability and support that’s associated with an established company.
•	It has financial management tools that help project managers with estimating budgets.
•	It can be licensed as a desktop application. While this might make it seem more like a dinosaur, there are still organizations that prefer this over a cloud solution.
•	It has templates to help users get started, which saves time.
Cons
•	Though MS Project Online is a cloud-based solution, it has several disadvantages. Even with Sharepoint, which is designed to take advantage of the cloud, MS Project has great limitations on the cloud.
•	It’s difficult to learn and use. There’s a lot of time and effort, and even intensive training, that must first be invested in the software before project managers and their teams are comfortable using the software. This adds time to the project during the implementation stage.
•	It’s expensive. The prices quoted above, again, are per person, per month. This quickly adds up as you buy licenses for team members who require access to the software in order to take advantage of its collaborative features. Otherwise, it’s more of an expensive tool solely for the project manager.
•	It’s not easily shareable. As mentioned earlier, files are saved in an MPP, a proprietary format, so that if you’re not using MS Project, you can’t read those files. This would be less of a problem if the software was less expensive, but if you must have an MS Project license to view an MPP file, then it adds up. This creates a lot of unnecessary hurdles when sharing project files.",Microsoft Project

Project Management,"Introduction to MS Project functionality
Microsoft Project provides an extensive range of features to aid project managers in planning, resource allocation, progress tracking, budget management, and workload analysis. However, this versatility comes with the tool’s inherent complexity.
Unlike with some more user-friendly MS Project alternatives, you can’t simply dive in and start working immediately. Completing an MS Project course, studying Microsoft documentation, and investing time in familiarizing yourself with the interface are essential.
Having navigated this process myself, I believe a broad overview of the tool’s capabilities is immensely beneficial. Thus, here’s an introduction to the key functionalities and how to navigate them.
Interface
Let’s start by exploring the interface. MS Project adopts a ribbon-based interface akin to other Microsoft Office applications like Word or Excel, making it instantly recognizable if you’ve used these before.
The ribbon is structured into tabs (File, Task, Resource, Report, etc.), each housing groups of related features and commands. On the left side, the Project View presents various views such as Gantt Chart, Task Sheet, or Resource Sheet.
Now, let’s navigate through the entire workflow from A to Z.
Key Functionalities
Creating a new project
If you’re here to dive into MS Project, chances are you’re eager to create and manage a project. It’s your initial step in the program. How to begin? Simply navigate to the “File” tab and select “New”. From there, you have the option to start from scratch, utilize a template, or import data from an existing file.
MS Project offers a range of predefined templates tailored to common project types. These templates include pre-set tasks, resources, and settings. It can streamline the project structuring process and save valuable time.
Next, move on to project information. Enter your project’s start date and other pertinent details in the “Project information” dialog box located in the “Project” tab. While there, indicate whether your project is scheduled from a start date or backward from a finish date, as this choice impacts task scheduling.
Configure the project calendar (Standard, 24 Hours, or Night Shift, or customize your own) to establish working and non-working days and times, essential for precise task scheduling. Though not mandatory, you can also input details like Project Title, Manager, and Company Name in the dialog area for reporting and documentation purposes.
Adding tasks
Task types
Since every project is made up of tasks, let’s see how to work with them in MS Project. First of all, you should know that you have different types of tasks. There are regular tasks form the core of your project, while summary tasks serve to group and represent related tasks, not consuming resources or time on their own.
Subtasks are the individual tasks nested under a summary task. Milestones mark zero-duration points in a project. Lastly, recurring tasks are those that happen regularly.
Task details
In the “Task” view, you can list down all the tasks required to complete your project. Tasks can be entered manually in the grid part of the view. Here, you define each task’s detail, such as:
•	Duration (the time estimated to complete a task in hours, days, weeks).
•	Start and finish dates (can be set manually or calculated based on the project start date, task dependencies, and calendar settings).
•	Links (you can establish different types of dependencies in MS Project).
•	Constraints (can be applied to tasks to control their start or finish dates).
•	Resources assigned to the task.
•	Work (the amount of effort, usually measured in hours or days, required to complete a task).
Using MS Project’s WBS, you can arrange tasks into a hierarchy with summary tasks and subtasks. This structure aids in visualizing the project’s organization and enhances the efficient management of related activities.
Note that you can split a task so that part of it is delayed to a later time in cases of dealing with interruptions or resource conflicts. Adding notes to tasks will provide extra information, clarifications, or reminders for yourself or team members.
Assigning and managing resources
Effective resource allocation and management in MS Project can significantly enhance your project’s performance if you understand how to utilize the relevant features. The “Resource sheet” in MS Project is where you define and manage resources that will be used in a project. Here, you can input detailed information, including the resource name, type, availability, and cost information. Plus, you can create a shared resource pool in case you need to manage a project portfolio in MS Project.
Once resources are defined, you can assign them to specific tasks via the “Task form” or “Task information” dialog. MS Project allows for the assignment of multiple resources to a single task as needed.
Every work resource in MS Project has a calendar that defines their working days and hours, holidays, and other non-working periods. These calendars ensure that resources are only scheduled for tasks during their available times.
Check out the “Resource leveling” feature that helps resolve overallocation by automatically adjusting task assignments and the “Resource usage” view for detailed information about how resources are allocated over time.
Setting up a timeline
A timeline is a tool that will help you to manage the Gantt Chart in MS Project. This view shows tasks, their durations, dependencies, and the critical path.
Click on the “View” tab and select “Timeline” to display the timeline view. You can also adjust the format and appearance of the timeline by right-clicking on it and selecting “Format Timeline”.
To modify how tasks are displayed on the timeline, you can also click on a task within the timeline and choose options to format it, change its shape, color, or add callouts for additional details.
Tracking progress
Monitoring progress in MS Project is vital for effective project management. It entails comparing the actual task progress with the planned schedule. In MS Project, you have various tools and features to facilitate this process.
Baselines
Before tracking progress, it’s essential to set a baseline for your project. A baseline is a snapshot of your project plan at a specific point in time, which you can compare against current progress. You can create a baseline in MS Project in the ‘Project’ tab, selecting ‘Set Baseline’ from the options within the ‘Schedule’ group.
MS Project calculates variances between baseline and actual data, such as start and finish dates, duration, work, and costs. Analyzing these variances can help identify tasks or areas where the project is not proceeding as planned.
Updating task status
MS Project allows you to mark tasks as complete, enter actual start and finish dates, and update the percentage of work completed. You can do it by clicking on tasks or “Task information”.
Built-in reports
MS Project provides a range of pre-built reports specifically designed for tracking progress, such as “Current Activities,” “Costs,” “Workload,” and more. You can find them in the “Report” tab in the ribbon at the top of the window. Click on the drop-down menu in the “Reports” group, and you will see all available report categories.
Managing the budget
The first step in budget management is to define the costs associated with your resources. This includes both work resources (people) and material resources (supplies or equipment). You can specify standard rates, overtime rates, and per-use costs for each resource in the “Resource sheet”.
For expenses that don’t fall neatly into work or material categories, such as travel expenses or training fees, you can use cost resources. These allow you to allocate fixed costs to specific tasks or phases of your project.
MS Project allows you to create budget resources, which are specifically designed for tracking the overall project budget. These are not assigned to individual tasks like other resources but are used to set and monitor the budget at the project level.
Generating reports
You will find various pre-built and customizable reports (Project Overview, Resource Status, Upcoming Tasks, etc.) in the “Report” tab.
Conclusion
This is not the full features set that you will find in MS Project. Later on you can explore time tracking in MS Project, project evaluation tools like PERT charts, advanced resource management, and others.
By understanding its core functionality you can efficiently plan, execute, and monitor your projects. As with any software, the key to mastery is consistent use and exploration of its capabilities.",Microsoft Project

The Disadvantages or Cons of MS Project
Over the years, Microsoft Project has established itself as a reliable project management software that has greatly benefited from user feedback. As a product of one of the largest technology companies worldwide, it enjoys strong support and boasts a wealth of online tutorials and resources. Despite its numerous features and widespread use, some businesses may seek alternative solutions while exploring different project management practices.
1. Too advanced for beginners
MS Project can be too advanced for beginners due to its complex interface and extensive features. The software requires significant learning and experience, which can overwhelm new project managers. Moreover, the software’s focus on traditional project management methods may not be suitable for those just starting with project management or requiring a more agile approach.
2. Expensive
Some consider MS Project expensive due to its licensing costs, which can be a significant business investment. Additionally, the software requires robust hardware and may necessitate additional training costs for employees unfamiliar with the tool. Lastly, the pricing model for MS Project is subscription-based, which can add up over time and increase the overall cost of using the software.
3. Limited Integrations
Microsoft Project Online is built on SharePoint Online and has limited compatibility with non-Microsoft products. While the software can seamlessly integrate with Microsoft’s task management app, Planner, it cannot connect with Project Server. As a result, users may need to utilize other communication apps from Microsoft, such as Outlook or Skype, to collaborate effectively.
4. Compatibility Issues
MS Project files in the .mpp format are proprietary, which can create compatibility issues when accessing them on devices without the software. Users may need to export and import files as a workaround, which can add complexity and time-consuming steps. Furthermore, the latest version of MS Project requires Windows 10 to operate the desktop application, limiting its compatibility with other operating systems. While free Project Viewer options are available, they typically only allow users to view and not edit the project.
5. The Gantt Chart is too Complex
The MS Project Gantt chart can be complex due to its numerous features and customization options, which can overwhelm some users. The chart requires a solid understanding of project management concepts, including task dependencies, milestones, and critical paths. Additionally, the software’s advanced Gantt chart features may not be necessary for all projects, leading to confusion and difficulty in utilizing this tool aspect.
6. Recurring Tasks Difficult to Use

Moreover, the software does not support recurring tasks with exceptions, making managing complex projects with varying task schedules difficult.
7. Managing Access Rights is a Complex Process
Managing access rights in MS Project can be complex due to the software’s limited security features.

Project Management,"Microsoft Project: The Good and the Bad
Below we’ll take a closer look at the strengths of Microsoft Project, and we’ll cover some potential drawbacks as well. This information is crucial to help you decide whether MS Project is right for you. You can decide whether the good outweighs the bad for your specific business and use cases.
What Microsoft Project is Good At
MS Project is a solid project management tool. But there are certain areas where it really shines above the competition. These advantages are based on real reviews from MS Project users.
Centralized Home Screen: If you’re familiar with other Microsoft products, then you’ll feel right at home using Microsoft Project The platform feels a lot like Excel and, just like Excel, you’ll need to have a firm grasp of the software’s capabilities to get the most out of it.
The home screen is an easy way to access the most important information with a centralized view. You can create new projects, open recent projects, or access top-of-mind information. This is especially useful for those of you juggling multiple projects at scale. Supports Multiple PM Methodologies: Many project management tools on the market only support simple, linear, and basic projects. But MS Project allows you to manage projects in whichever way that you see fit. The software supports Scrum, Kanban, and custom workflows. You can use it for agile project management, waterfall project management, or even hybrid methodologies.
Adding newsprints to a project, customizing the duration, and adding tasks can be managed with a few simple clicks. MS Project can be fully customized to support your preferred project management style.
Resource Management: The resource management capabilities of Microsoft Project could be considered an advanced solution on its own. It’s not necessarily a common or standard feature offered in other PM solutions on the market. Using this suite of features in MS Project to identify your team members’ capacity so you can assign tasks accordingly.
Multiple Project Views: For users, projects can be managed from different views within MS Project. The grid view is an easy way to plan projects with an ordered list of pending tasks. There’s also a Kanban-style board view that’s an excellent visual resource to see the overall status of a project.
You can even fully customize task boards. Additionally, MS Project offers a Gantt chart view. This helps track dates and the relationships between tasks on a visual timeline. It’s easy to switch back and forth between each view based on your needs and project management style. Project managers and team members alike love this flexibility. In addition to managing human resources, MS Project supports other work-related resources. You can use it to track resources like materials, equipment, and other project-related costs. MS Project allows you to add tons of details here. You can even add a unit of measure for each resource and enter any associated costs. Custom Reports: Microsoft Project delivers high-level reports to help you review and refine your project management processes. You can customize what you want to be displayed on each report, too. For such complex software, MS Project’s reporting features are surprisingly easy to use. Just head over the reporting section of the interface and select the data that you want to include.
Reports come out looking extremely professional and are easy to share and use in presentations with executives and stakeholders. You can even add tables and other visual elements to make the reports easier to digest.
Time Tracking: MS Project has a timesheet submission feature, allowing team members to track how they are spending their time on project work. It’s a great way to capture both project and non-project-related tasks. In addition to tracking how much time was spent on a task, time spent can also assigned to specific categories.
For example, a user might fill a timesheet for a specific project task and classify it as research and development. This is particularly useful for invoicing, payroll, and job costing. Not every project management software includes time tracking tools, so the fact that you can get this feature built into MS Project is a huge advantage. Project Portfolio Management: MS Project has exceptional project portfolio management capabilities. It can easily be used to model different portfolio scenarios—allowing leaders and decision-makers to determine the best strategies for success. You can use it to weight proposals against other drivers to find out varying project costs and how certain paths will affect your resources.
It’s an advanced way to evaluate ideas and proposals. Leaders can also set up a standardized process for reviewing each use case that flows in, determining how to proceed with each new project in the portfolio. This is definitely more of an advanced capability that’s built for experienced portfolio managers and larger businesses. Smaller teams working on one or two projects simultaneously probably won’t need to get this far into the weeds.
Project Management at Scale: Microsoft Project is an ideal solution for midsize and larger organizations. With so many tools out there being marketed towards small teams and beginners, it’s nice to see Microsoft Project stand out by accommodating larger teams’ needs. Large teams need quality solutions, too!
If your organization has complex project management needs, there’s a good chance that MS Project can solve them. When this software is put in the right hands, it feels like anything is possible. On-Premises Deployment: We’ll talk about pricing later, but we really like that Microsoft Project is available as either a cloud software subscription or as an on-premises solution that you can install on local computers. Having an on-premises option is becoming rarer with software packages, but larger organizations can seriously benefit from it when they want to ensure their internal or proprietary data is protected from prying eyes and security breaches.
What Microsoft Project is Lacking
Like most software, MS Project isn’t perfect. So make sure you take the following factors into consideration when you’re evaluating MS Project against alternatives on the market.
Not Kind to Beginners: Microsoft Project is not an entry-level project management solution. In fact, it’s not really even for people who are just familiar with project management concepts. The software is designed for experienced project managers and technical users.
You’ll need more than just some general technical knowledge to figure out how MS Project works. If you don’t fall into this category, you’ll struggle with the software, and so will your projects. Poor In-App Communication: In terms of team communication, MS Project has room for improvement. You can’t just quickly message or ping a team member within the platform. With that said, Microsoft has tons of other communication tools.
It’s likely assumed that most MS Project teams organizations already leaning hard on other Microsoft products. So you’ll need to use Teams, Outlook, Skype, Yammer, or another one of Microsoft’s tools to communicate with your team. These features aren’t duplicated within MS Project itself. Lack of Integrations: MS Project doesn’t really play well with other business tools, especially those outside the Microsoft family. It doesn’t connect with Zapier either, which is a popular online resource to sync third-party apps that don’t natively link with each other.
If you want to integrate your project management tool with other platforms like Salesforce or Slack, MS Project won’t be an ideal solution for your needs. On the flip side, if you’re using Office 365 and other Microsoft tools, MS Project will fit in perfectly. Steep Learning Curve: MS Project is not one of those tools that you sign up for today and start managing projects in a matter of minutes. There’s definitely more of a learning curve, especially when onboarding new users. MS Project assumes that users are already familiar with big-picture concepts of project management. From there, it’s just about learning how to use the software.
There are plenty of resources and tutorials from Microsoft explaining how to do certain things within the platform. However, you need to know what to look for first. Even experienced users will need to take some time to get used to Microsoft Project. No Updates on Perpetual License: For on-premises deployments of MS Projects with a perpetual license, you’re not getting updates to the software. While you do own the software outright and you’re not paying an ongoing monthly fee, you won’t get the latest updates like you would with the web version.
Microsoft Project Pricing and Options
Microsoft Project Pricing
MS Project is not part of Microsoft 365. You can add it to your Office 365 subscription or just purchase it as a standalone product. There are two different ways to buy Microsoft Project. It’s offered as a cloud-based solution, which is charged as a monthly per-user license. MS Project can also be bought as a one-time fee for on-premise deployment. Within each deployment option, there are several different packages to choose from. We’ll discuss those plans and prices in greater detail shortly.
Compared to other project management tools on the market, the structure is unique. The vast majority of project management software is only offered as a cloud-based tool. So, the fact that Microsoft Project can be deployed on-site makes it stand out from the crowd.",Microsoft Project

Project Management,"What is Microsoft Project?
Microsoft Project is the project management software in the Microsoft Office suite of programs. Microsoft Project is the world's most widely-used project management software and has been since its release. MS Project currently has around a 66% project management software market share. Proficiency in Microsoft Project is a must-have skill for aspiring Project Managers. Project management is a booming field: the number of Project Manager jobs is expected to increase by over 33% over the next five years. The Project Management Institute (PMI) predicts that over 22 million new project management jobs will be created by 2027. Project management is growing rapidly because more companies recognize the need for professional help managing projects. However, there are already more Project Manager positions than employees trained in project management. Microsoft Project assists Project Managers in prioritizing tasks, defining expectations, delegating tasks, tracking and managing resources, creating and tracking budgets, and sharing calendars with your team. Project also includes project management methodology tools, such as kanban boards and Gantt charts. Some of Project’s major features include tools for project planning, communication and collaboration, progress tracking and reporting, roadmaps for project tracking, financial management and timesheets, and resource management. Project is fully integrated with Microsoft Teams, allowing team members to share files, attend meetings, and chat easily. Its scheduling features are automatic, which can help teams stay on track with less direct supervision from the Project Manager. Project also incorporates the cutting-edge Microsoft Power BI dashboard, allowing project teams to visualize and analyze data in real-time. While Microsoft Project may seem easy to learn because of its familiar Microsoft Office interface, you will need to learn its advanced features to use it effectively. Senior Project Managers praise its power to manage multiple complex projects. Developing your ability to manage complex projects is the key to a successful career in project management.

Project management is a hot career path: the Project Management Institute (PMI) predicts that over 22 million new Project Manager jobs will be created by 2027. Even without this 33% increase in job positions, there is already a significant talent gap in project management, with more companies seeking Project Managers than qualified candidates. Another perk of a career in project management is a high salary: the average salary for a Project Manager is around $116,000 annually. That is more than double the national average of approximately $50,000 across all occupations. Training in project management could lead to a lucrative career. Project Managers need to have many skills, including soft skills such as communication, leadership, and time management. Project Managers will also need to have advanced skills using Microsoft Project, the world’s most widely-used project management software tool, for decades.

Its powerful project management features include interactive dashboards for project monitoring, integrated project timeline, task prioritization and delegation, team dashboard, report generation, resource tracking and management, and the Master Project Plan for managing multiple projects.
Common Professional Uses for Microsoft Project
The history of project management goes back to the “megaprojects” of the post-war era, including NASA’s Apollo moon missions, the development of nuclear weapons in the Manhattan Project, and the building of the U.S. Interstate Highway System. Project management originates in the defense and engineering industries, and Microsoft Project is still widely used in the engineering and defense industries. The Project Management Institute (PMI) predicts that over 22 million new Project Manager jobs will be created by 2027: a 33% increase over the next five years.

Training in Microsoft Project Helps You Get Hired
Training in Microsoft Project can help you get hired as a Project Manager. Potential employers will see your commitment to project management through your Microsoft Project training. If you’re a new or aspiring Project Manager, having additional training in Microsoft Project could be the extra step needed to get you started. To become a professional Project Manager, you’ll want to demonstrate that you’ve mastered Microsoft Project. Self-guided training won’t be enough for a Project Manager resume, so you’ll want to pursue training that includes a Certificate of Completion to demonstrate your skills. For example, NYIM offers an introductory course, Microsoft Project Level I, and a more advanced class, Microsoft Project Level II. Graduates of both courses receive a Certificate of Completion, which is sharable on Linkedin. Microsoft Project uses Microsoft Power BI.

How to Start Learning Microsoft Project
If you’re an aspiring Project Manager, you’ll need to learn Microsoft Project. Thanks to the internet, there are multiple options for how you can learn Microsoft Project, including live classes, on-demand classes, and free online resources.
Live classes can happen in person and live online. Because these classes are happening live, you’ll be able to ask questions and interact with your instructor and classmates in real-time. If you’re someone who likes the interaction of a traditional course, you’ll want to choose a live option. Noble Desktop’s Classes Near Me tool will show you in-person and live online Microsoft Project classes. A second option for training in Microsoft Project is on-demand and self-paced courses. These courses are typically more structured than teaching yourself but lack a live course's interaction, camaraderie, and mentoring. Linkedin and Udemy offer on-demand Microsoft Project courses which cover the basics, but you won’t be able to ask questions. On-demand and self-paced courses are ideal for visual learners who are self-disciplined enough to complete the course independently. While on-demand courses offer greater flexibility, the lack of accountability can cause some students to finish more slowly or not at all. If you want to stick with free resources, Noble Desktop offers free online seminars on various topics, including Microsoft Office. In their free online Excel Tutorials, students are guided through developing more advanced skills in Excel, including data validation, creating and formatting charts, projects, PivotTables, array formulas, functions, and beginner macros. Or, you can browse the entire list of free tutorials Noble Desktop offers on their YouTube page. Read the full guide on how to learn Microsoft Project.

Some users who do not have experience using spreadsheets may find the interface complex and difficult to understand initially. The Smartsheet free plan is very basic and can be limiting for small teams looking for free solutions.
When users cancel a Pro or Business plan, the unused part of their subscription is not refunded. For canceling an Enterprise plan, businesses need to consult their sales representative.
Smartsheet Core Features
Smartsheet is a powerful cloud-based project management and collaboration tool that has a wide range of features to enable teams to plan, track, automate and report on project progress. Here we discuss some of its core features.
Role Assignment Features
Smartsheet has four predefined user roles—admin, owner, editor and viewer—with a specific set of permissions and access levels that can also be customized according to project or team requirements. As a user, you can share sheets with individuals, groups or the entire organization and set access levels (view, edit, comment, etc.) for each separately.
You can also share sheets with external collaborators such as clients or vendors by defining roles and permissions and setting access expiration dates or passwords for added security.
Timelines
Smartsheet’s timeline view displays tasks, milestones and events in a timeline format, making it easier to track project progress. Users can customize their timeline view to show additional details such as start and end dates, duration, task dependencies, milestones, etc. Timeline view can also be filtered to view only specific tasks or milestones.
Gantt Charts
Gantt chart is a powerful visual tool in Smartsheet, which allows project managers to track tasks, milestones and project timelines. It uses a timeline format, where additional details such as start and end dates, duration, time milestones and task dependencies can also be displayed.
With its drag-and-drop interface, users can create task dependencies and complex project schedules in just a few clicks.
Smartsheet’s Gantt chart automatically adjusts timelines based on changes to other task dates and dependencies, such as delayed predecessor tasks. It calculates project critical path automatically, making it easier for project managers to identify critical tasks and prioritize them accordingly.
Software Integrations
Integrations can help streamline workflows and ensure that data is consistent across apps used by your organization. Smartsheet integrates with a range of third-party tools such as Microsoft Office, Google Workspace, Slack and Salesforce. Smartsheet Business and Enterprise plans also provide integrations with Brandfolder, Adobe Creative Cloud, Tableau and Power BI.
Dependencies
Smartsheet has several features to manage project dependencies and create dynamic schedules automatically for paid plans:
•	Dynamic Gantt Chart: Smartsheet’s Gantt chart automatically adjusts based on changes to task dates and dependencies. In case a task is delayed or moved, the Gantt chart will automatically update to show the impact on other tasks and the project schedule.
•	Critical Path: Smartsheet automatically calculates the critical path of a project—a sequence of tasks that ensures the shortest possible project duration. This enables project managers to identify tasks most crucial to project success and prioritize them accordingly.
•	Predecessors and Successors: Smartsheet allows users to create task dependencies by setting predecessors and successors. This ensures a task cannot begin until all previous tasks marked predecessor have been completed.
•	Dependency Reports: Smartsheet offers dependency reports that show all tasks that are dependent on other tasks, as well as any tasks that have no dependencies. This helps project managers identify any missing dependencies and ensure that the project schedule is accurate.
Budgeting
Smartsheet budgeting templates can get you started with budgeting quickly and easily. Smartsheet also allows you to track costs associated with tasks and projects and stay within budget. Resource management features further enable managers to optimize resource allocation, using them efficiently and effectively taking into account budget constraints.
Smartsheet Setup and Customization
Signing up for a Smartsheet free trial (30 days) is as simple as filling out a sign-up form with these details: name, email address, company name, roll and number of employees in the company. You receive a confirmation email in the email address provided. Click on it and you will be taken to Smartsheet.
When you log in to Smartsheet for the first time, you will be asked to set personal details but you can skip this step. You can also invite team members using just their email IDs.
The default view of Smartsheet is the spreadsheet-like grid view but it can be changed easily. To get you started, Smartsheet has a wide range of templates for different use cases, which can be fully customized according to your specific needs.
Smartsheet Ease of Use
Every project or work that you start in Smartsheet begins with a sheet. This is quite different from other project management apps that start with a list or board view. But if you have used a spreadsheet in the past, it can feel very intuitive. You simply add everything in the sheet rows, starting from a blank sheet or a template.
However, for someone not used to spreadsheets, the interface can look difficult initially.",Smartsheet
Project Management,"Who is Smartsheet for?
Smartsheet is for the project manager that loves the versatility of an Excel spreadsheet but is looking for more in terms of functionality, reporting, and visual flair.
This platform is definitely inspired by Microsoft's interface style, opting for a function toolbar at the top of every window and similar navigation system as most Microsoft Office products.
However, this nearly identical setup to Microsoft's gives Smartsheet a slight learning curve if you're more experienced with other project management tools such as Wrike or Asana.
In essence, Smartsheet takes everything fun about spreadsheets introduced by other tools like Airtable and brings them back down into a more corporate world. This tool is better suited for corporate projects than creatively driven marketing teams.
In fact, I believe Smartsheet is explicitly suited for those implementing a lean project management strategy where measuring productivity and minimizing product inventory (for the sake of keeping costs low and quality high) are the key pillars for success.
Smartsheet's features
Smartsheet offers nearly every feature that a project manager would need to manage and complete the tasks at hand. Finding those features while using the software is a different story at times.
Management and planning features:
•	Task prioritization and scheduler: Smartsheet gives you the choice between their standard spreadsheet (grid) view, a Gantt chart, a card view suited for scrum ceremonies, and a calendar view. You have plenty of options to choose from when it comes to project planning.
•	Shared team calendar: As mentioned in the previous bullet point, Smartsheet offers a shared calendar view which displays tasks extending over the time period they are meant to be completed.
•	Time tracking: The flexibility of Smartsheet's grid view allows you to create time tracking fields.
•	Resource management: All of your project resources are trackable through the customizability of Smartsheet's grid view.
Document storage
Smartsheet includes a file column in each spreadsheet where you can upload images, documents, and other relevant files for each individual task.
Collaboration features:
•	Communication: Smartsheet includes a commenting column so team members and project managers can communicate progress for each individual task in the grid sheet.
•	Team dashboards: Dashboards are custom created by the user based on the selected data in the project grid sheet. Unlike many other project management solutions, these dashboards are not automatically set up for you.
Budgeting features:
•	Budget reports: You can create and render detailed financial reports in Smartsheet all sorted by hours, days, and amounts.
•	Budget dashboards: Just like the team dashboards, budget dashboards are custom made through selected project metrics from the grid sheet.
Smartsheet's ease of use
Right off the bat, you'll know whether the Smartsheet software will be an easy or difficult tool for you to learn. If you're highly skilled with spreadsheets and understand all of the benefits they provide, then Smartsheet will be a cakewalk.
However, if you're more used to a traditional project management software setup offered by tools like Mavenlink, Asana, or Jira, then you're likely to face a learning curve, as I found out the hard way.
Now, that's not to say I don't have any experience with spreadsheets, because I'm decently skilled in Excel and Google Sheets. That being said, I'm not as talented as I wish I was. What's more, I found Smartsheet a little difficult to navigate.
Creating a project in this tool was easy enough thanks to the extensive list of templates to choose from, but I struggled once I ventured out looking for other features such as reporting or dashboards.
Eventually, I had to lean on Smartsheet's knowledge base in order to figure out how to take advantage of these features and discovered that nearly everything you do is built through your grid, which is their term for spreadsheet.
In fact, I used Smartsheet's knowledge base for about half of the features I tested on this platform. One of the few features I found easily was the task management views button, which is located on the grid view toolbar.
The Gantt, calendar, and card views were a little unremarkable in terms of their user interface, but their functionality was fantastic.
The Gantt view was very reminiscent of Microsoft Project with the grid view remaining on the left while the chart populates on the right. As you add tasks and dates, the Gantt chart will populate these durations into the chart complete with names and dependencies if you add them.
These functions are crucial when building out the project timeline in your scope of work or project proposal, and Smartsheet is definitely up to the task.
As for simpler tasks that I was able to figure out on my own, my knowledge of spreadsheets came in handy. Creating new tasks is as simple as right-clicking a row, inserting a new one beneath, and filling out the cell details to represent a new task, including due dates, task status, user assignment, attachments, and comments.
As for adding additional task fields, all you'll have to do is right-click on one of the column headers and select either ""insert column left"" or ""insert column right.""
You'll find no standard task or field buttons like in other project tools. Instead, you'll have to perform every function as if you're using Excel or sometimes, Microsoft Project.
You just have to decide whether or not that is the type of project management experience you are looking for and if it's worth the price tag Smartsheet commands.
Smartsheet's pricing
Speaking of price tags, I was surprised what users are asked to pay for this software option:
•	Individual: $14/month -- One official user plus limited access for collaborators, unlimited spreadsheets, great for cross-functional teams, integrations, templates, and automated workflows
•	Business: $25/month per user -- All previous features, plus dashboards, activity log, reporting, custom branding
•	Enterprise: Contact for pricing -- All previous features, plus enhanced administrative controls, system admin features
•	Premier: Contact for pricing -- All previous features, plus premium support, premium apps, premium integrations (Salesforce, Jira, etc.)
Smartsheet charges jump substantially once you move beyond the basic option, especially considering the fact that it behaves like just any other spreadsheet most of the time. Is that worth the cost of taking on this platform?
That's for you to decide, but if you're asking me, I can't say Smartsheet does a great job justifying what they charge their users.
The individual tier is very affordable, but once your needs exceed this platform, the price jumps up to a staggering $25/month per user.
That's quite high in my opinion considering the fact that you're paying for a slightly more advanced spreadsheet program, not to mention the Enterprise and Premier tiers are probably higher based on the fact that the pricing is not made readily available.
Smartsheet's support
I mentioned before that I struggled when it came to creating new dashboards or reports in Smartsheet, leaving me to rely on their knowledge base and other forms of customer support in order to learn their platform.
When it comes to the pros and cons of Smartsheet, this is where the platform truly shines. All of its support services, including several forms of training, certifications, and support request portals are available while using the program, as opposed to searching for them on the vendor website. That's very refreshing.
Benefits of Smartsheet
The primary benefit of Smartsheet is the versatility afforded by using a spreadsheet-based platform. If you live and breathe Microsoft Excel, you'll love working in Smartsheet since the functions and user interface are extremely similar.
You can create all kinds of dashboards and reports to fit the needs of your project so long as you understand the ins and outs of the platform.
However, I see this benefit as a double-edged sword, since this wide open versatility gives this platform a steeper than average learning curve. Unless you're experienced with spreadsheets, you might struggle learning how to perform seemingly basic project functions while using Smartsheet.
On the flip side, Smartsheet security is a huge benefit for users looking to protect their data from hackers and other forms of corporate espionage. Smartsheet offers all kinds of encryption and permissions that'll keep your information safe at all times from those who would otherwise do harm to your operations.",Smartsheet
Project Management,"Smartsheet: The Good and The Bad
Smartsheet has numerous breath-of-fresh-air redeeming qualities for spreadsheet and database fans. If that sounds like you, it may be worth the confusing interface and expensive price tag.
The Good
Team collaboration tools: In addition to project management, Smartsheet brands itself as a “dynamic work and collaboration software.” Teams can easily collaborate with file sharing, notes, and tasks, all within a central source of truth. This allows everyone on a team to keep up with the progress of a particular project.
Multiple team members can share presentations, images, and PDFs to work on content at the same time, complete with notifications, version control, and a customizable approval process. The entire Smartsheet solution is highly customizable so you can add the collaboration features you need and remove the ones you don’t to keep things as simple as possible. In fact, Smartsheet made our list of the best simple project management software options.
Powerful analytics and reporting: Admins, managers, and users love Smartsheet’s reporting capabilities. The advanced reporting makes it easy to consolidate the most crucial information from multiple sheets into a single report in just a few clicks or taps. In doing so, you can identify trends and potential bottlenecks to continuously improve. You can also publish and share your reports with team members, departments, stakeholders, or anyone else who should be in the loop. You can even use Smartsheet’s activity log to see who is accessing reports and when they’re doing it so you know who’s seen what. One standout feature of Smartsheet’s reports is that they’re bi-directional—if someone makes a change on the report, it’s updated in real-time back to the attached sheets. And reports update in real-time when someone updates the attached sheets. So, you never have to worry about outdated information again.
Data security: As an enterprise-grade solution, Smartsheet uses top-of-the-line data protection standards to keep your team, your data, and your business secure with a Fort Knox-style gusto. It offers dozens of security features, including two-factor authentication, single sign-on (SSO), granular user access controls, secure data centers, AES 256-bit at-rest encryption, and more to prevent unauthorized access. Smartsheet is also HIPAA, GDPR, ISO, SOC, ITAR, and FERPA compliant so you can rest easy knowing you don’t have to worry about privacy and security compliance.
Robust automation tools: Most project management tools come with basic automation features but Smartsheet outshines most of them with an incredibly comprehensive set of integrations, connectors, intelligent workflows, and automation tools.
Despite its power, setting up basic automations takes just a few minutes thanks to Smartsheet’s drag-and-drop automation builder. It uses basic logic, conditional paths, and triggers, allowing you to create even the most advanced workflows you can imagine.
Automatic document generation: Smartsheet is one of the few work management tools that can automatically create documents based on form submissions or data within your system. Users can even sign documents right within Smartsheet using the DocuSign integration.
Extended functionality: Besides basic project management, you can add resource management, digital asset management, and portfolio management capabilities that will give rise to project budgeting, time tracking, advanced reports and analytics, and forecasting tools, among others. However, these features aren’t baked into Smartsheet’s plans—they’re an add-on that have an additional price tag. But it’s nice to know that the platform expands to match your needs rather than making you buy another tool to grow your business.
Customization and flexibility: One of Smartsheet’s claims to fame is flexibility. Much like a spreadsheet, you can manipulate your sheets into just about anything, from project management and inventory management to budget tracking, expense categorization, campaign tracking, and more. You can use it in hundreds of different ways, which makes it a contender to replace other business tools you may be using for other functions or departments. You get unlimited custom fields, multiple views, and unlimited sheets. So, there are no limits to how you can use Smartsheet—compared to other project-management-only tools, it’s refreshingly versatile.
Take advantage of templates: When you want to be up and running quickly with Smartsheet, you can use one of the 350 templates that are part of the software. The template provides a basic structure for managing your project. You then can adjust the template as needed to perfectly fit your needs for a particular project. Smartsheet’s sprint planning template is one of the best available among project management software packages. We also named a few agile project plan templates from Smartsheet among the best available in the market.
The Bad
Confusing for beginners: Spreadsheets are something that the vast majority of us are familiar with. In theory, Smartsheet shouldn’t have a steep learning curve. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. The interface isn’t very user-friendly, which can make it challenging to chart and analyze data. Unless you’re generating reports, there’s no real easy way to analyze the sheets at-a-glance. You’ll have to manually go through rows and columns, which is tough to do at scale. Limited activity log: Smartsheet’s activity log allows users and admins to track common actions, like who has viewed what, what’s been shared, and more. However, this log is a bit limited compared to other project management tools on the market today. You can’t really just get a quick glance at what’s happened since you last logged in. Sometimes it can be time-consuming to get an answer. For example, to see a full history of a particular cell, you’d need to navigate to that cell, right-click, and then find the history from there.
Higher prices: At first glance, Smartsheet seems pretty affordable. Plans start at just $7 per user per month. However, when you take a closer look at these packages, you’ll find Smartsheet to be a bit expensive compared to other project management tools on the market today. And they require a minimum of three users on any plan, so you’ll be paying more that you have to if you only need a platform for one or two users. Odd autosave feature: For some reason, Smartsheet does not autosave your changes or update the page to reflect edits in real time. This issue admittedly won’t be a big deal to everyone, but we find it to be incredibly annoying. Most cloud-based software packages save your changes in real time, so it’s a feature we’ve come to take for granted. Smartsheet requires you to click a Save button and a Refresh button after you make changes. You can go into the Settings window of Smartsheet to set up autosave once a minute or when you leave a sheet, so you can sort of work around the problem. (However, we believe you shouldn’t have to.)
Smartsheet Pricing and Options
Smartsheet Pricing
Smartsheet offers four plans, with each offering more features and fewer limitations than the last.
There’s also a separate package called Smartsheet Advance that includes everything on the Enterprise plan, plus all the extra add-ons you’d have to pay for on the Enterprise or Business tiers.
•	Free — Up to one user and two editors
•	Pro — $7 per user per month
•	Business — $25 per user per month
•	Enterprise — Custom pricing
•	Smartsheet Advance — Custom pricing
One big thing for the bargain hunters out there to be aware of: Smartsheet requires a minimum of three users on any plan (aside from the free one). In reality, the starting price for Pro is really $21 per month and $75 for Business.
The free plan may work for very basic project management. It limits you to two sheets, but you do get Gantt, Grid, Card, and Calendar views, which is nice. Many others restrict you to one or two views.
At first glance, Pro and Business seem similar–the Pro plan limits you to 20 GB of storage and is limited to 10 editors. It’s not super clear, but you’re also limited to 10 widgets on each dashboard, 250 automations per month, one sheet per report (you can’t run reports on multiple projects), and 30 MB for attachments.
Business has far more storage and fewer restrictions across the board. All those limits above disappear and you’ll get 1 TB of storage plus a 250 MB upload limit.
However, the advanced features, like conditional form logic, proofing, publishable reports, a document builder, unlimited automations, custom branding, integrations, and security features, really make the difference between Pro and Business.
You’ll also get two of Smartsheet’s newest features on the Business plan: timeline view and workload tracking. You could technically do these things before, but now they’re significantly easier to set up.
Smartsheet’s Enterprise plan unlocks unlimited storage, AI tools (new), advanced security, better customer service, and a no-code app builder.
Smartsheet Advanced
Many truly advanced enterprise tools are only available as paid add-ons to the Business or Enterprise plans. Things like data connectors, CRM and software development integrations, scalable portfolio management, and secure request management all cost extra.
The Smartsheet Advanced package is the only way to get all of these without paying à la carte. There are three tiers, each of which includes different add-ons: Silver, Gold, and Platinum.
Enterprise users are the only ones who can upgrade to Smartsheet Advanced.",Smartsheet

Limitations and Disadvantages of Smartsheet
While Smartsheet offers robust project management features, there are several limitations that you should be aware of before incorporating it into your workflow:
Learning Curve
Despite its spreadsheet-like interface, Smartsheet’s more advanced features, such as automation and integration capabilities, can have a steep learning curve. You may need time to fully grasp how to leverage these tools effectively.
Smartsheet Cost Factor
Smartsheet can be expensive, especially for small businesses or teams just starting out. The more advanced features are locked behind higher-tier subscriptions, which might not be cost-effective for everyone.
Performance Issues with Large Data Sets
Users have reported that Smartsheet can slow down when handling very large data sets or complex automated workflows. This could impact productivity, particularly for larger organizations with extensive project requirements.
Limited Real-Time Collaboration
While Smartsheet does allow for collaboration, it does not support real-time editing as smoothly as some of its competitors. This might be a drawback for teams that require simultaneous, live document editing.
Overwhelming Features
For teams looking for simple task management, Smartsheet’s array of features and options can sometimes be overwhelming. It may offer more functionality than necessary, which can complicate rather than simplify project management.

Smartsheet lets you create forms to collect data. You can share these forms with others and enter information right into the sheet.
Multiple Views
Smartsheet offers four different views to visualize and organize your data: grid, Gantt chart, card and calendar. The grid view is the default and displays your data in a familiar spreadsheet format. The Gantt chart view is useful for project managers to manage project timelines. We also like how well it merges with the grid view.
If you prefer a kanban view, you can use the card view in Smartsheet, though it is not as appealing as in other project management tools (here’s our list of the best kanban apps). Lastly, the calendar view allows you to display tasks based on date fields.
Collaboration Tools
You can share an entire sheet, specific sections of a sheet or a whole workspace with team members. Plus, you can set different levels of permission for each person. Smartsheet also allows for real-time collaboration and tracked changes via cell history.
The “conversations” feature is another collaboration tool that allows team members to communicate and provide feedback within a specific row, card or sheet. Collaborating on content is also made easy with the “proofing” feature. This allows anyone on the team to review, edit and approve documents directly within Smartsheet. However, this feature is only available with the Business plan or higher.
Smartsheet doesn’t have native Scrum or Agile project management capabilities, but you can connect it with Jira.
Automation Tools
Smartsheet offers a workflow template gallery for users to quickly create automated workflows. You can customize the template or create your own intelligent workflows from scratch. We like how simple it is to create a trigger or an action and set up conditions. However, it doesn’t have as many options or offer the same drag-and-drop functionality as monday.com
Resource Management Tools
The Resource Management platform is a premium add-on product for resource allocation and project planning. It provides robust features such as budget tracking, task tracking and time tracking. With this platform, project managers can efficiently analyze data and allocate resources.
Resource Management is sold separately on the Pro, Business and Enterprise plans. You can test out the free 30-day trial to decide whether it’s worth the investment.
User-Friendliness & Hands-on Testing
Smartsheet’s user interface may not be the best out there, especially compared to more visually appealing project management tools like Asana or Trello. However, it still offers a decently user-friendly interface and ease of use. If you’re a beginner, you can follow Smartsheet’s in-app tutorials and guides to quickly learn the basics.
How to Install Smartsheet

In addition to the typical view options like List View, Box View, Calendar View, Board View, and Gantt View, you can also try out Mind Map View (planning and organizing projects and tasks visual outlines), Workload View (visualizing your team’s capacity and managing resources), and Activity View (an aggregated view of all activities across a specific location, people, and project type).
Automations: There are more than 100 pre-built automations you can use or customize to match your needs. The intuitive automation builder uses triggers, conditions, and actions to help you get more done in less time. You can choose from 50+ actions and triggers, so there are plenty of options without feeling too overwhelming.
Easy time tracking: ClickUp makes it easier to manage your time at work by offering flexible time tracking features that help you focus on your work and improve time management. Use the tool to track time, set estimates, add notes, and view reports to be more in control of your work hours. What’s more, you can mark billable time to see how many hours should be expensed on invoices, plus add or subtract from your tracked time if needed.
Excellent mobile app: Considering the importance of anytime-anywhere access in today’s world, ClickUp is one of the few project management software tools that offer users a well-functioning mobile app that lets them get work done, check for important updates, assign tasks, and so on, at the touch of the screen. The app comes with an intuitive interface and user-friendly features, making it easier than ever to create new tasks, update colleagues, and, of course, manage projects on the go.
What ClickUp Is Lacking Steeper learning curve: Compared to Monday.com and Smartsheet, ClickUp’s learning curve is pretty shallow. But compared to Trello and Asana, it’s steeper. Overall, ClickUp falls in the middle in terms of its complexity.
It can feel overwhelming: While ClickUp is a relatively structured project management tool, there are still a lot of different things you’ll need to figure out before it feels like second nature. On top of that, the sheer number of capabilities can feel daunting. You may end up going down rabbit holes or overcomplicating your project management processes just because you can.
ClickUp AI costs extra: If you want to use these features, you’ll have to pay an extra $5 per user per month. Other project management tools include these at no extra cost.
A lot of “free trial” features: On the lower tiers, you can try out some of ClickUp’s more advanced tools. However, you won’t be able to keep using them once you hit an unclear (at best) limit. Gantt, timeline, workload, and mind map views can only be used 60 times on the free plan, for example. You’ll be able to use them 100 times on the Unlimited plan, but it’s not very clear what exactly that means.
Some features may feel half-baked: ClickUp’s constantly adding new capabilities. Some of them don’t always feel 100% complete when they release them. On top of that, some features stay that way for quite some time.
Advanced time tracking features: If you want to track time spent on the various tasks for your project by marking them as billable hours, this process is only available in the Business pricing tier and higher. You also can only add time entry descriptions and labels to particular tasks in the Business tier and higher.
ClickUp Pricing and Options
ClickUp pricing is pretty straightforward. There are four plans to choose from, one of which is entirely free. It’s a great place to start and many teams may be able to stay there for quite some time.
You’ll get unlimited projects and users, but there are a ton of limitations–many features are only available for a certain number of uses, which can get frustrating. You’re also limited to 100 MB in storage space, which is virtually nothing. On top of that, any guest you invite has full access to everything–there are no access controls at this level.
The cheapest paid plan is reasonable at $7 per user per month. However, it too still has limitations on many features, including Gantt, timeline, workload, proofing, and timesheets.
Business at $12 per user per month eliminates most of those restrictions. It also gives you advanced automations via webhooks, email, SMS, and integrations which can go a long way in improving your workflows. This is also the first tier that allows users to create private docs for themselves.
For larger teams with more organizational requirements, Enterprise offers far more administrative controls for organizing the platform, managing users, and keeping things secure.
It also allows for custom branding, conditional logic on forms, custom roles and permissions, and a wide range of other security options.
How ClickUp Ranks
ClickUp is a project management solution that we highly recommend here at Crazy Egg.
While it’s a no-brainer for small teams and independent workers, it also offers enough features and functionalities for larger enterprises. The pricing is very competitive, which together with its versatility and flexibility, allows you to identify and remove bottlenecks and keep projects and tasks on time always.
ClickUp does have a slightly steeper learning curve than its competitors–you may be able to get by with something a little easier for your employees to master. It’s all tradeoffs, though, as the lighter and easier tools on our list can’t track projects with the same degree of detail as ClickUp.",ClickUp

Some of the links in this post are affiliate links. This means if you click on the link and purchase the item, we will receive an affiliate commission at no extra cost to you. All opinions remain our own.
Managing teams, assigning tasks, generating reports, and handling core business processes can be demanding. Project management comes with several responsibilities. This is where ClickUp comes in!
ClickUp’s core focus is to help you organize basic business tasks such as sales, marketing, business development, product research, and design. If you’re not using this software, you should be, and we can tell you why.
Earmarked Comments
Leaving notes and comments on tasks does not work on many project management platforms because they can easily go unnoticed. ClickUp solves this issue. It allows you to assign tasks using the “mention feature” in the comments. You can add actions to comments, convert them to tasks, and get them precisely set to a colleague. When you’re done with them, simply mark them as “resolved.” Say goodbye to employees missing essential instructions!
Clickup is Free
ClickUp offers most of its features for free. Unlike most project management tools that claim to provide free versions, with ClickUp, you actually get unlimited tasks and unlimited members for free! Only the very special functions are restricted to paying users.
Multi-task Management
Imagine having to make the same modifications to multiple tasks. Whether it be relocating, assigning, or updating, this could be really tedious and time-consuming. ClickUp allows you to make changes to multiple tasks with a click. With the multi-task toolbar, you can select multiple tasks, adjust them, change groups, make updates, make tags and assign projects in groups.
Available on Mobile Having the option to access and manage projects from your mobile makes work much more comfortable. With ClickUp’s Android and iPhone mobile app versions, you can access your projects in minutes, add comments, create tasks, manage teams, etc.
Advanced Rich Editing
Many projects and tasks need descriptions that serve as a guide to teammates and assignees. Obviously, you wanna make sure these instructions are clear and detailed, so there’s no confusion/ miscommunication.
ClickUp offers you rich formatting features that allow you to structure text in a simple but organized way. Editing features available in ClickUp includes:
•	Heading hierarchies
•	Emoji options
•	Font styles and colors
•	Image embedding option
•	URLs
•	Bulleted List
Time Management
Most project management tools have no time tracking feature unless you decide to get a complementary integration. ClickUp offers you a native Global Timer that helps track and record the duration of your tasks. Also, you can log in from any computer device and still keep track of your time.
All in all, ClickUp helps you achieve your productivity goals promptly.
Privacy and Sharing Options How do people collaborate on your projects if they don’t have access to perform tasks? For effective remote collaboration among your team, having sharing options on tasks and projects is essential. But still, not all tasks should be accessible to everyone on the team.
Clickup is the project management software that offers you these features. It allows you to set your tasks to private, authorize sharing options, and even private-mode spaces.
Offline Mode Option
Unfortunately, there are moments when we don’t have access to the internet, but we need to check in on our tasks and projects. Many project management software don’t offer offline functionality. With the few that do, this feature is only available on mobile.
ClickUp permits you to work offline, whether on mobile or desktop. You can work on tasks, irrespective of location. Your tasks also get synched as soon as there’s an active internet connection. Tasks that you created offline become visible after going online. Additionally, ClickUp’s offline feature even allows you to set reminders offline. This mode is available on Android, Web, iOS, and Desktop.
Improved Communication Via Clip Feature
With ClickUp’s clip feature, you can record your screens and windows. This function makes it easier to demonstrate tasks to your team through videos. Furthermore, it improves communication and makes all your instructions clear.
All-in-One Tool Feature
The challenge with managing projects is that it requires the application of more than one software. Softwares like Trello and Jira seem to be popular amongst managers. Yet, their application seems complicated and lacks the multifunctional feature. Here’s what happens when you use the tools mentioned above:
•	One tool solves one problem, the other solves another.
•	Teammates have to replicate most of the tasks, which can be time-wasting
•	You manage tasks differently on each platform.
•	You are likely not to have an overview of the entire project on one platform.
Subsequently, all these reduce your team’s productivity and efficiency. ClickUp helps you tackle this problem through its single multifunctional feature. It provides a single platform from which you can manage, assign and execute all projects. This means increased workflow management, elimination of excessive meetings, multiple-project view option, and elimination of complementary software integrations.
In Conclusion
ClickUp is unique and distinct from other tools because of its multi-purpose feature. Every other management tool is either too complex or requires the integration of too many apps. With ClickUp, all tools you need to execute tasks are available on the software. Would you rather have all your projects scattered across different project management software or have them managed just on a single platform? Clickup, with its many features and functionality, proves to be a solution. It’s flexible, easy, and simple to use. Regardless of your project management objectives, ClickUp has the structure, support, and tools needed to help you get the work done!",ClickUp
Project Management,"What Is ClickUp & Why Use It?
ClickUp is a highly versatile and powerful project management tool that can be used by both teams and individuals. It combines important business application features and consolidates company project data into a single online solution.
Here are ClickUp’s major pros and cons.
Pros:
•	Efficient dashboard view
•	Customer-centric updates
•	User-friendly layout
•	Cost-effective
Cons:
•	Learning curve
•	Minor UI problems
•	Tracking time limits
There are many things going for ClickUp. The ClickUp dashboards provide excellent visuals and information. The layout enables teams to organize multiple projects, and it is constantly adding new features, improvements and enhancements based on customer feedback. Additionally, ClickUp can replace multiple apps required to manage and organize different company projects, track the progress and save resources, making it a cost-effective option.
However, some users could get overwhelmed by the number of features available, particularly during the initial setup. There are also some minor UI issues, such as the small text and the lack of color contrast. Additionally, the native time-tracking features could be improved.
ClickUp Features
ClickUp acts as the prime hub for teams to work on projects using features, such as tasks, docs, chat, goals, whiteboards and more. Let’s discuss the main features of the project management software.
Time Management
Identifying what needs to be done is the first step towards managing your time effectively. Thus, it is crucial to build a system for prioritizing your work. ClickUp is all about organizing tasks to help you meet your long-term objectives, as well as prioritizing tasks that must be completed first.
Project managers and business owners can easily take advantage of ClickUp’s time management features, which help optimize workflows by encouraging more seamless communication.
Mobile Compatibility Quick action is made easy with ClickUp mobile. Users can access ClickUp on any device, keeping them updated on projects wherever they are.

Through the app, users can organize tasks, edit them easily, interact with their team, view all of their to-dos at once and stay informed thanks to push notifications.
Tagged Comments
When someone is tagged in a comment, their name will be highlighted in their notification feed. They also automatically become a “watcher,” a user who gets notified whenever there are changes in the task. This helps team members prioritize the most important action items and increases oversight of critical project tasks.
Users can group, filter and assign tasks in their preferred order using the tag functionality. Tags make it easy to share task information across your workspace, which improves overall workflow.
Views & Collaboration
With ClickUp, users can choose from nine different view types, including list, board, table, box, calendar view, Gantt, activity, timeline and workload view. ClickUp encourages collaboration through team reporting, real-time editing, real-time syncing, comment editing, mentions and multiple assignees. The software also supports emojis, screenshot editing, comment assignment, discussions, setting comment reminders, sharing and quoting.
Free Use
The most basic version of ClickUp is available for free and is surprisingly robust. When compared to its competitors, even advanced features and views.
The only caveat is that some of these advanced features come with usage caps. For example, you can only use the Gantt view 100 times on the free plan before you’re forced to upgrade. Goal-setting and custom field creation are also restricted, and storage is limited to 100MB in total.",ClickUp

ClickUp Use Cases
ClickUp enables teams to manage work and adapt its key functions depending on main areas of focus and need.
Task management
Hundreds of tasks across many people and groups can get out of hand quickly without a solid record of what needs to get done, by whom, and when. ClickUp is reliable for organizing tasks, tracking changes and updates to work items, and presenting a big picture view of what the team is working on at any moment in time.
Customized task management through over 35 ClickApps lets users:

ClickUp Pros and Advantages
ClickUp is a favorite because it provides an all-in-one solution for teams that don’t want to invest too much time on setup and training. It has a little bit of something for everyone.
All-in-one platform
ClickUp has a reputation for being able to solve everyone’s problems with project management. The user-friendly interface is easy to use and straightforward, enabling users to plan, track, and manage any type of work for any type of team with this strong productivity tool.
Task management and planning
ClickUp simplifies task management and work planning by allowing users to create and assign individual tasks to one person, with more specific subtasks to keep things moving along. Multiple people can also be assigned to a task or group of tasks for collaboration and to expedite project priorities.
Interconnect tasks, projects, and documents
With ClickUp, a simple task can be used as a vehicle to connect everything related to a specific work item in one place. Tasks can be interconnected with projects and relevant documentation, so there is no question what is being asked and what supports the work involved to create it.
Kanban boards for linear task view
Project managers can create the perfect Agile workflow using board view. A flexible kanban board will help teams visualize work and keep it organized and prioritized. Boards can also be customized and arranged as needed to analyze a project from any angle. And the Everything View can be used for a high level view of all work.
High level of customization
The ability to customize so many aspects of a team’s projects and tasks lives in custom statuses and templates. Templates can be used to tailor team spaces with custom workflows, features, tags, and privacy settings.
Integrations
Project managers can find comfort in the ability to integrate with over 1,000 outside tools for free. Every week, new ones are announced or enhanced, providing engagement to check back often to see what additional help and support is available to help project teams operate even better.
ClickUp Cons and Disadvantages
While ClickUp can be versatile for a broad range of use cases, it is good to understand if it has the depth of functionality to replace a dedicated solution.
Too many notifications
Project managers tasked with coordinating a heavy lift of work for a decent number of people will either see notifications as their friend or enemy. ClickUp can send all kinds of notifications, which are best managed through the notification center. Users can access and change how they receive notifications in their settings. Failure to do so may result in an overwhelming number or default notifications.
Limited time tracking
ClickUp could benefit from more robust time tracking functionality. Time tracking device widgets allow users to see the total time each person on a team has tracked, including cumulative time tracking logs on what is going well and what it takes to get something accomplished.
Dashboard views could be cleaner and more modern
Views of boards can be made less busy and a lot cleaner, so users can find what they need to know with a glance. There is a lot of information that can be accessed and displayed. Keeping it to what needs to be known and shown is the key.
Report performance could be improved
Generating and accessing reports can sometimes take longer than expected. Information is being pulled from a lot of data points, and an improvement in this area would greatly benefit ClickUp users and allow them to work more efficiently.",ClickUp

Project Management,"Basecamp brands itself as a tool that helps you work better, stay organized and realistically maintain work-life balance. It is much more than a project management tool. Besides the typical project management features, it has a range of built-in tools for real-time as well as asynchronous communication within a team.
In this article, we will look at the project management and team communication features available in Basecamp. Let’s dive in and find out if this is the right tool for you and your team.
Pros
Low-cost per-user plan
Pro Unlimited plan includes every feature offered by Basecamp
Syncing calendar for all employees is easy
Free account for teachers and students
Cons
No longer offer a free plan (unless you’re a student or teacher)
All-inclusive plans might not be suitable for solopreneurs or small teams
What Is Basecamp?
Basecamp is a widely used project management and remote team communication app that caters to businesses of all sizes. Similar to other project management tools that charge per user, Basecamp offers a flexible pricing plan for individuals and small teams that costs $15 per user per month.
Basecamp’s Pro Unlimited plan offers zero limits on users and charges $299 per month, billed annually. It’s a bit cost-prohibitive for smaller businesses, but if you have a larger business and need everyone on project management software, it could be a good value. The features don’t differ, but Pro Unlimited plan users get more storage, priority support and one-on-one onboarding help.
Although Basecamp did not make our list of the best project management software, we highly recommend it for remote teams. Effective communication is crucial for successful project completion, and Basecamp offers a plethora of tools to facilitate collaboration, including message boards, real-time group chat and automatic check-ins.
Potential buyers can test-drive Basecamp for 30 days without having to input credit card details. This will provide access to everything Basecamp has to offer, including 500GB of storage space, unlimited projects, 24/7 support, real-time chat and no contracts.
Whichever plan you choose, Basecamp’s interface is highly intuitive and easy to use. After logging in to your account, create a new project and you are ready to go. You can see that the project has all project management features in one place. The team communication features are available at the top of every page.
The best part here is that you can keep all communication related to a project within the project itself. This helps your team focus on a single project, not get distracted and complete them in time. Also, you don’t end up clogging communication channels with project details no one is interested in.
What Sets Basecamp Apart
Basecamp provides an all-encompassing solution that integrates project management and team communication features seamlessly. There are a few different ways you can communicate with your team in Basecamp: Automatic Check-ins, Campfire, Pings and Message Board.
The Automatic Check-ins tool is a great way to set up questions for your team that you may ask daily or weekly. Campfire is a more casual chat among project members. It’s a bit like a conversation you’d have in a Discord or Slack channel. The Message Board is exactly what it sounds like and a bit more permanent (more like a forum than a chat channel). And Pings are direct messages for more private communication.
The Hill Charts feature offers a visual representation of project progress, allowing teams to identify potential roadblocks and take corrective action. Alternatively, you can view a project in cards or as a list. Also, you can invite clients to view projects whenever you need at no added charge.
These features are highly valuable for most teams, as they help them remain focused, organized and on track. However, not all users may find these features necessary or useful. Some users may prefer more customization options or integrations with other tools, which are currently lacking in Basecamp.
The per-user cost for Basecamp is a bit pricier than the industry standard and the unlimited plan could be too costly for small businesses, but it depends on your total employee count—it could be affordable for large teams. Most notably missing from Basecamp are essential project management features including Gantt charts, budgeting tools and task dependencies.
Pros
Basecamp’s all-in-one platform, communication tools, Hill Charts and client access are valuable features that set it apart from other project management and team communication tools. Given that both paid plans include all features and the availability of a free account for teachers and students, this an attractive project management solution.
Cons
Basecamp’s lack of customization options may not work for all users. The per-user and monthly cost of Basecamp’s plans are more expensive than most of its competitors. Plus, there are some missing key features that teams may need and there’s a limited list of integrations.
Core Features
Basecamp’s role assignment, timelines and communication tools are essential features for successful project management. They help teams stay organized, track progress and stay on budget.
Role Assignment Features
Basecamp allows project owners to assign roles and responsibilities for each project. This helps ensure everyone knows what they’re responsible for, and who they can go to for help.
Timelines
With Basecamp’s timeline feature, team members can visualize project milestones and deadlines. This helps them stay on track and ensures they complete the project on time.
Software Integrations
As of publication, Basecamp integrates with 72 other software to extend the functionality of the platform. So, if you need features such as Gantt charts, time tracking, invoicing or feedback gathering, you can integrate with a third-party app.
Communication
Teams can communicate with each other in multiple ways via Basecamp. Send a Ping (direct message) to one or more people, post a question or comment on the Message Board or have an ongoing discussion in Campfire. You can also comment on tasks as needed.
Basecamp Pricing and Plans
Please note that Basecamp also offers free accounts to teachers and students (including homeschooled students). To get this benefit, users need to send an email from their school account after signing up and Basecamp should be able to verify the authenticity of their claim.
Basecamp
Basecamp’s starter plan costs $15 per user per month on a month-to-month basis. It comes with every feature Basecamp offers and doesn’t limit you by number of users or clients added. Storage for files is limited to 500GB and there’s no one-on-one onboarding.
Basecamp Pro Unlimited
If you have a large team, Basecamp Pro Unlimited may be the best option for you. This plan includes all the same features, but it adds a few perks. Storage increases to 5TB and you get priority support and one-on-one onboarding. You also get great admin control with the option to require two-factor authentication (2FA).
Setup and Customization
After registering for either a free trial or a paid plan, launching a new project is a breeze. The platform has a clear and user-friendly interface, and it provides helpful tutorials and guides.
Basecamp has the capability to be customized, for instance, by uploading a logo, altering colors of projects and selecting notification settings. However, Basecamp offers fewer customization options than other project management tools.
People transitioning from another project management tool should consider the learning curve for both themselves and their team. Although Basecamp is straightforward to use, it can take time for team members to become comfortable with it if they are accustomed to a different tool.
Ease of Use
The heart of the Basecamp platform is its projects, which allow users to organize, communicate and manage tasks related to specific initiatives. Creating a new project is simple, requiring only a name and description. Users can customize their projects by selecting the tools they need and organizing them in a preferred order.
Basecamp allows you to create and save project templates, which can save time by providing frequently used messages, to-dos and files. Communication tools are simple to use and serve different purposes, so conversations make sense in different arenas. Adding users, tasks and tools is a straightforward process, but you have to know where to start. For example, Basecamp offers Automatic Check-ins for recurring questions, which is a huge time-saver, but you have to turn that tool on from the three-dot menu on each project.
Security
Basecamp has taken significant measures to ensure the security of its users’ data. To prevent bottlenecks and points of failure, all uploaded files are stored on servers with modern techniques, and data is backed up daily and stored in multiple locations. The platform also uses HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, and files are encrypted when stored.
Its servers run at full redundancy, and Basecamp facilities have sophisticated physical security measures in place, including biometric locks and round-the-clock surveillance monitoring. Basecamp’s software infrastructure is regularly updated with the latest security patches and runs on a dedicated network with firewalls. In case of a security breach, affected customers are promptly notified.
Customer Service and Support
Basecamp provides customer support from real humans, not automated bots. If you have any pre-sales questions, need assistance with the product or have any other inquiries, you can contact its support team and expect a response within approximately 10 hours. You can also find help by accessing its tutorials and help guides.
In our tests, we found Basecamp customer support representatives were quick and knowledgeable. Typically, responses took a little more than an hour via email.
Additional Features
Having the ability to simplify workflows and manage projects correctly is important for both project managers and team members. Basecamp provides plenty of features to help you reach this goal. Here are some of the standout features:
Customizable Templates
Rather than creating similar projects from scratch each time, you can create a project template and save it to Basecamp. It’s a great way to simplify workflows. You can also create to-do templates, which also saves time. Basecamp doesn’t include these templates, though.
Card Table
New to Basecamp is a Kanban-style board, but named Card Table. It has a slightly different visual than most Kanban boards, but it follows the same concept. Simply create a card and then move it along the stages until the work is complete.
Guest/Client Access
Basecamp offers easy guest and client access, allowing users to invite external collaborators and clients to specific projects. Users can control access levels and permissions, ensuring that clients and collaborators only see what they need to see.
Boosts
As you complete work or post comments, others can react with emojis to celebrate goals and milestones you meet. These are known as Boosts and Basecamp will notify you anytime you get one. It’s a fun way to provide little bits of recognition as you complete tasks or a project.",Basecamp

The software provides a comprehensive, Bird’s-eye-view of how things currently stand in business operations, and its unified interface makes it simple for each team to manage projects.
2. Good for managing basic projects. Do you manage basic projects? If yes then Basecamp is a good choice for basic projects that don’t involve too many moving parts. For example, managing a small blog or designing a basic website with minimal graphics.
3. App integrations. If you’re using a PM tool that doesn’t allow app integrations then god saves your projects! Seriously. However, Basecamp does help to save your projects as it allows users to integrate several popular apps, like Slack, Mailchimp, and Salesforce.
4. Powerful search. It’s not always easy to search for the right information in projects and this tedious process can make some of you resort to taking headache pills. Basecamp’s powerful search enables users to find what they’re looking for without having to scroll through a myriad of messages. You can search by keyword or person, images or files, or projects.
5. Data Backup. Organizing and managing all your project-related data can be quite challenging, especially when teams are operating from diverse locations. Basecamp allows users to keep information organized through the uploading and linking of files to projects. Users can drag and drop files directly from Google to Basecamp.
6. Keeps Data Safe and Private. Basecamp auto-backs up your data on an hourly basis and complies with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield policy, which adds another layer of security. Basecamp Project Management Cons (with ProofHub’s Solutions)
Alright, by now it’s clear that Basecamp offers some useful features to project teams and individuals for efficient project management. However, Basecamp is quite limited in its functionality, and might not be an ideal solution for many project teams.
Let us take a look at some of the major drawbacks of Basecamp that can hamper your project progress. 1. No Gantt Charts!
The thing is that Basecamp is so basic in its functionality that you could choose any other powerful project management tool and your team will appreciate your decision! If you want to have a clear view of your team’s projects then Gantt charts can be of great use. However, Basecamp does not have them, which means you will have to look elsewhere. How ProofHub Solves This Problem
What Basecamp does not offer; ProofHub makes up for that. An inbuilt Gantt chart software helps project teams of any size to easily visualize, plan, and schedule tasks on Gantt. You can set task dependencies, highlight critical paths, associate milestones, track progress, drag and drop tasks as work changes, export or print Gantt charts, and see all your Gantt data in one central place. “Two ladies, one website & lots of collaboration. ProofHub helps us improve coordination, communication, and project execution. You don’t realize how much time you waste every day proofing via email until someone shows you a better way. I almost pulled out my credit card before even testing it. ProofHub is the way to go!” – Delia Jalomo
2. Lack of Task Prioritization! Basecamp is a basic project management tool that offers you to-do lists for easy organization of your tasks. Now, that is not the only thing that you want as a project manager or team member. You would not want to spend your valuable time on tasks that are of little or no importance. How would you let your team members know which tasks require their immediate attention? You cannot prioritize tasks with Basecamp and that’s a BIG letdown to anyone who uses this tool. How ProofHub Solves This Problem
ProofHub allows project managers to assign personal or group tasks to team members and prioritize these tasks with deadlines, time estimates, and labels. These crucial details help task assignees know which task they should work on first to ensure timely completion and delivery. 3. Lack of Time Tracking! Time is the most valuable resource of any business. If you don’t know where your team is putting all their time, you don’t know how much time is going down the drain either! With Basecamp, you do not get any dedicated time tracking tool, which leaves you with no option but to look for a powerful alternative that offers you time tracking.
How ProofHub Solves This Problem
With ProofHub, you cannot go wrong with time! The built-in time-tracking tool of ProofHub allows you to record how much time is being spent on tasks. You can do it manually or through automatic timers. You can also set time estimates for tasks, add timesheets, and create time reports of people and projects.
4. Lack of Advanced Project Tracking Features!
Can you expect a basic project management tool to carry advanced project tracking features? No, if you are realistic. Basecamp offers you Hill Charts, the only way to see where your projects stand.
Hill charts are subjective; project statuses are updated manually and it can show how a particular individual feels about the progress. It can vary from person to person.
How ProofHub Solves This Problem
ProofHub, being a powerful software for project management, empowers project managers to have ultimate control over projects and teams from a centralized location. ProofHub offers you several powerful project-tracking capabilities that allow users to stay on top of all your projects. Gantt charts and Kanban boards give you a clear view of how your projects are progressing as you can adjust your plans as work changes. 5. Lack of Work Request Forms Basecamp does not offer any option to users if they want to send work requests or queries directly to the tool. It means cluttered inboxes and greater chances of missing out on work requests. There has to be an easy way to take care of this aspect. “ProofHub made everything easier, smarter, and faster, without breaking the bank. Thanks to ProofHub, 1. We have better control of our projects, tasks, and communications. 2. We work together better. 3. We’ve been saving tons of time. 4. We’ve eliminated all the fuzziness from our work process. 5. We’ve been identifying and knocking problems out faster. 6. We achieve better work satisfaction. 7. We’ve been able to bring down our project delivery time. And… we’re 10x more productive!” – Capterra Review
How ProofHub Solves This Problem ProofHub solves this problem as the tool allows you to create work request forms and collect work requests from both internal and external users. Forms help to create a clear communication channel between external clients, teams, and stakeholders. Requests are automatically added as tasks to the project’s designated task list. For example, you can organize all of your customer support requests in a specific project, and task list, and your design, marketing, and other requests can be stored separately. 6. No Online Proofing! What! No online proofing in Basecamp? How are people supposed to collaborate on designs and documents, and get them reviewed and approved? Sorry, says Basecamp, we don’t have that! It seems that you would need to invest separately in a range of tools because Basecamp does not have them. Relax, you don’t have to stick to it because there are better options available. How ProofHub Solves This Problem
As more and more people work remotely, ProofHub is their trusted tool for real-time collaboration on files, designs, and documents from any location, on any device. Using markup tools, users can review files, proof them, and approve them with a single click. 7. Lack of Pricing Options! Not all project teams are the same. They have different budgets. However, Basecamp offers just a single flat-pricing plan to users at $99 per month. Now, what if a team has a lower budget and cannot afford to spend this amount? Sadly, Basecamp seems to care less about teams that have a limited budget. How ProofHub Solves This Problem ProofHub is designed for teams of every size. The tool offers two flat-rate, fixed pricing plans that allow an unlimited number of users. You can choose between the Essential plan with CORE features ($45, per month) and the Ultimate Control plan with CORE+PREMIUM features ($89, per month). 8. Lack of Multilingual Interface! Know what? Basecamp is strictly meant for people who can use it in English! If you want to set the language of your interface in a different language of your choice then all doors are shut on you. In times when companies are hiring talented professionals from around the globe, using a PM software like Basecamp can cause communication problems within the team. How ProofHub Solves This Problem
ProofHub does not have one but 10 solutions (other than English) to this problem. ProofHub is available in German, Spanish, Chinese (Taiwan), Dutch, French, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, and Polish languages. You can set the language of your choice for your interface and have complete control over the language in which all your content is displayed. Basecamp Pricing

Project Management,"The Pros and Cons of Using Basecamp Software
Businesses rely on their teams and employees to help them meet their objectives. However, coordinating team members and ensuring everyone is on the same page is not always easy. Fortunately, project management tools like Basecamp allow businesses to enhance collaboration, improve communication, and easily manage workflow.
Basecamp is a popular web-based tool designed for team collaboration. It enables individuals, small teams, and groups to collaborate on projects, events, or other assignments. Basecamp is currently in its third version and constantly undergoing tweaks and improvements. It allows users to create projects, delegate tasks, start chats, add file attachments, monitor progress, check deadlines, and automatically update team members on the status. If you feel Basecamp’s pricing is too high for your budget, consider looking at AceProject. By charging per project instead of per user, this software offers the potential for significant cost savings.
The Pros or Advantages of Basecamp
1.	Easy to Learn and Use: Basecamp has built its reputation on its simplicity since its launch. This tool is designed to be simple, allowing teams to focus on the work instead of the tool. Its user interface is clean, minimal, and well-organized to facilitate easy visualization and interaction. Its core features are also intuitive. Moreover, you will get a guided application tour after installing the tool.
2.	Ability to Create Client-Specific Projects: Basecamp helps clients get more involved. It allows its users to add specific clients to a project or set up their client-focused projects, all under a single account. A user can create a client-dedicated project and communicate with the client through that project. They can also share project details with the client and forward client emails directly to Basecamp. 3.	Built-in Communication Features: Basecamp offers its users plenty of communication options. For focused discussions, you can use message boards where every topic has a separate space. If you want urgent clarification on a task, you can send a private message to a team member through ‘Pings’ instead of using the chat thread. Users can hold informal discussions in the ‘Campfires’ section. 4.	Excellent Customer Support and Favorable Pricing: Basecamp is well-known for its fast and reliable customer service. When contacted, they respond quickly to emails. The company also provides a wide variety of training aids and tools. When it comes to price, their rates are fair and competitive when compared to other PM tools. They have a free plan with limited features and a paid plan for unlimited projects and users. No matter how big your team grows, the price doesn’t change.
5.	Integrations and Cross-Device: Although Basecamp is a great app, it’s not a complete tool. It can be integrated with many add-ons, Power-Ups, and extensions to expand its capabilities. Numerous tools integrate with Basecamp to offer enhanced usability. For instance, if you want to fill Basecamp’s reporting and exporting gap, you can combine it with Bridge24 for Basecamp. Basecamp can be accessed on multiple devices, including PCs, smartphones, and tablets. 6.	Data Backup: Keeping all project-related data, such as documents, Wireframes, PDFs, and pictures, in one place can be challenging. This can be more problematic when the team operates from diverse locations. Basecamp allows users to upload and link files to projects to keep information organized and enable teams to share assets. Users can also drag and drop files from Google directly to Basecamp.
The Cons or Disadvantages of Basecamp
1.	It Has No Tags or Labels: Basecamp can make teams more organized with its dedicated pages for tasks, built-in scheduling, storage capabilities, and other features. However, it doesn’t allow you to put a tag or label on a to-do task if you want to prioritize, allocate, or categorize work. Yet, this is a common feature in other project management tools.
2.	No Time Tracking: One of the most critical aspects of project management tools is to track time to ensure the team is on course to finish the project before the deadline. Sadly, Basecamp doesn’t have a time-tracking feature. If you need to track time, combine it with another application.
3.	Lack of Advanced Features: Although Basecamp’s tools, like Ping, Campfire, Check-in Questions, or Quick Search, function remarkably well for their purpose, they are not enough for a team that needs advanced capabilities. Basecamp doesn’t have analytical tools that can offer insightful project information.
4.	Limited Customization: Basecamp users have raised concerns about its customization settings. Although you can mute notifications when you don’t want to be interrupted, users who don’t turn off the notification settings complain of the barrage of messages they receive about everything that happens on the tool. They prefer that the platform have controls that could be tweaked to meet personal needs.
5.	Limited Chat Management: Basecamp’s messaging capabilities are excellent, but managing the chats can be a nightmare. The tool’s topics and conversations can’t be archived, making things look crowded and untidy.

Project Management,"Basecamp is an online project management and team collaboration software with various capabilities. Users can create to-do lists, assign tasks to one or multiple people, attach files that can be shared and searched, and automatically update everyone involved about the status of the to-do items. Basecamp’s third iteration is notable for its emphasis on uncomplicated organization and several communication tools, among its most robust features. The platform also offers a free personal plan with limited features.
Basecamp Cons and Disadvantages
Basecamp, as a trailblazer in online productivity software, has established a devoted following. The platform’s emphasis on providing only the essential features has made it less daunting for companies that may feel intimidated by technology. Nevertheless, if you intend to use Basecamp for your business, it may be beneficial to obtain additional details.
1. No Tagging or Labeling Function
Basecamp provides dedicated pages for to-dos, schedules, and documents, making businesses more organized. However, the platform does not offer the ability to tag or label to-dos for grouping, categorizing, or prioritizing purposes, which are now standard features in other PM tools. Although Basecamp has a search function and filters, other software also provides these capabilities.
2. No Time or Expense Tracking
Basecamp facilitates collaboration and feedback for those working with clients. However, the platform does not have a built-in time or expense tracking feature, which may be necessary for billing purposes. Users may need to integrate another application or use separate software for managing their timesheets and invoicing clients. Businesses offering professional services may benefit from dedicated PSA software.
3. Limited Features
Basecamp’s tools, such as Ping, Campfire, or Check-in Questions, perform consistently well for their intended purpose. However, businesses that require more than messaging systems, such as analytics or forecasting for resource planning, may need to use other project management software. Basecamp is more of a task management and collaboration software than a project management tool.
4. Limited Cross-Project Views
Basecamp helps manage individual projects with multiple tasks. However, if businesses need to work on various projects and view them all together for a consolidated view, this may be challenging on Basecamp. Integrations can help, but using another PM tool with specific features for working across multiple projects may be better.
5. Limited Customization and Settings
Basecamp users have reported a lack of options to get settings right, such as turning off notifications. Although users can turn off notifications, they complain of a flood of email notifications for everything on the platform if they don’t. Basecamp’s simple all-or-none setting lacks more options, such as personalized settings for notifications.
6. Limited Reporting and Exporting Capabilities
Basecamp’s lack of reporting tools built into the software has been a frequent concern of users. Although real-time updates are beneficial for getting project status or progress, exporting in a report format for presentation purposes, sharing readable documents with clients, or analyzing data may not be possible without additional tools.
7. Limited Integrations
Basecamp focuses on essentials, designed based on the minimalist philosophy of its founders. However, the available apps and services for integration are limited, restricting teams and businesses that need specific or additional capabilities not offered by the PM tool.
8. Fixed Pricing
Basecamp’s pricing scheme is straightforward. The complete edition costs $99 monthly, including all features, unlimited users, projects, clients, and 500GB of storage space. While this may seem attractive to larger teams and companies, smaller teams that need more features may have to pay more because the required features are not offered.
Basecamp Pros and Advantages
1. Single-Page Projects
Basecamp is one of the few project management apps with single-page projects. Regardless of the project’s size, you can track its progress and stay updated on its status. Even if you have numerous projects running simultaneously, Basecamp ensures that no data is lost, making it easy for your team to follow and complete projects quickly and efficiently.
2. Personal and Business Options
Initially designed for business professionals and small business owners, Basecamp now offers a personal plan that allows individuals to organize their projects while keeping followers updated on projects unrelated to the company. Business plans are still available, but the personal option is less expensive and offers all the same features.
3. Mobile App
Basecamp’s official mobile apps for iPhone and Android users provide a comprehensive overview of your projects, no matter where you are. Third-party solutions are also available for BlackBerry and Windows Phone users. The mobile app even has a chat function for casual conversations or discussing upcoming deadlines.
4. To-Do Lists
Basecamp’s to-do lists make it easier to keep track of specific tasks. They can be assigned to individuals or groups and have due dates added, ensuring everyone knows the deadline. Comments can also be added to the to-do list, making it helpful in discussing tasks multiple people are working on.
5. Easy File Transfers
Basecamp can handle large files, making it a preferred means of transferring files such as wireframes, visuals, images, and PDFs to back up ongoing projects. When files are attached to a message, they are automatically added to the files section of Basecamp for everyone to access, making file transfers more manageable.
Conclusion
In our opinion, Basecamp’s pros outweigh any cons, such as using to-do lists, file transfers, and the ability to keep tabs on everyone’s schedule. However, one criticism is that if a new message or to-do is not assigned to anyone, no one will receive a notification, which could result in messages going unnoticed. The lower costing plans are also limited in the number of projects or users allowed.",Basecamp

You cannot tailor the look and feel of the platform extensively, which may be a drawback for teams looking for a more personalized or branded experience. Pricing Structure Basecamp’s flat-rate pricing, while beneficial for large teams, might not be cost-effective for smaller teams or individual users.

This includes integrations with email, calendar applications, time tracking tools, and more, allowing teams to maintain their workflows without needing to switch between different platforms. 4. What are Basecamp’s key features? Key features of Basecamp include to-do lists, message boards, schedules, file storage, and automatic check-ins. Together, these features provide a comprehensive suite of tools that support project planning, communication, and resource management. 5. Is there a mobile app available for Basecamp? Yes, Basecamp offers a mobile app available for both iOS and Android devices. The app allows users to manage projects, communicate with team members, and access documents from anywhere, ensuring productivity remains high even while on the move.",Basecamp
Project Management,"Basecamp Review
Basecamp is a complete solution for project management and team communication. The software brands itself as an “all-in-one toolkit for working remotely.” Compared to other remote working solutions, it stands out because of its wealth of built-in collaboration tools, like group chat, message boards, and team schedules.
Basecamp: The Good and The Bad
Despite not being one of our top five project management tools, Basecamp is an all-around excellent tool for remote teams. However, that doesn’t mean it’s right for you and your team. Do the positives outweigh the negatives? Let’s find out.
The Good
To-Do Lists: Basecamp is more than a traditional project management solution, but it doesn’t skimp out on task management features, including to-do lists. You can easily split tasks into projects to stay organized, split projects into phases, assign due dates, assign one or multiple users, add comments, notes, and even attach files to each to-do. If something’s overdue, everyone involved will know about it as soon as it happens, so you never have to follow up on late tasks again. Managers can look at the activity view to get a quick glance at what got done today, what’s overdue, and what’s coming up so they’re always in the loop. And individual users can leverage the “my stuff” menu to see all of their tasks in one place, even if they span multiple projects.
Real-Time Communication: Because it’s a remote work platform, Basecamp comes with dozens of collaboration features, including real-time communication tools that eliminate the need for third-party tools. Other project management tools limit communication to just comments on tasks or cards, but Basecamp also includes group chat, message boards, and pings. Grou chats are for casual internal communication and message boards are for larger-scale communications like announcements, pitching ideas, and sharing progress updates. You can also use the ping feature for 1:1 or small group conversations. As such, you can keep all of your real-time communications centralized in one place without cluttering communication channels with info no one cares about.
Client Access: Unlike most project management tools, Basecamp lets you set up custom access settings for clients so you can give them direct access to track the progress of your current projects. In doing so, you can say goodbye to the neverending back and forth status updates with clients, freeing up more time to work on project execution. When setting access settings, you get full control over what clients can see, what they can edit, and what they can’t see. By default, everything is private unless you choose to share it with a client. You can share to-dos, messages, and even forward emails from clients directly to Basecamp to centralize all of your communications in one place. It also works for sharing insight with stakeholders and managers who don’t need full access.
Integrated Calendar: Syncing calendars is a common point of friction for just about every business, but it’s particularly challenging for remote teams. Basecamp’s integrated calendar feature lets users sync their Google Calendars, iCals, and Outlook calendars so everyone can see who’s available when. Users can also toggle tasks and due dates on or off to see a complete schedule of what’s coming and which tasks are due when. You can choose to display different types of events, to-dos, and tasks associated with a specific project to distill your calendar down to the things that matter most. Beyond that, users can easily schedule calls with each other rather than chatting about what time works.
Automatic Check-Ins: As a remote team, we’re all too familiar with status meetings and hopping on calls to see where things are at, but Basecamp offers a check-in feature that makes it possible to eliminate status meetings for good. Managers can create custom questions for team members to answer on a set schedule. You can choose from daily, weekly, and monthly check-ins to check up with your team on whatever time frame makes sense. You can ask your entire team, specific teammates, departments, or special groups as well. On top of that, you can respond directly to check-in answers or leave feedback without the need for a meeting to do so. It’s one of Basecamp’s standout features that makes it a great fit for remote teams—plus, Basecamp users love it.
Document Sharing and File Storage: Every Basecamp project workspace has a place for sharing files, documents, and images. Everyone working on the project will have access to these files, so it’s easy for people to find what they’re looking for. All files show a complete version history. You can even color-code files and reorder them to keep things organized. Add links to Google Docs or drag and drop a local file for upload. Notification Management: Each user can customize how they are notified for messages, tasks, and more. You can pause notifications at any time or set specific hours for when you want to be notified (such as 9 am to 5 pm Monday to Friday). Basecamp has an option that you can enable with a summary of what you missed while you were away. So, you won’t have to manually browse through to-dos and calendars to see what’s going on. All of this can be viewed in a quick summary. Flat Rate Pricing: Basecamp is very affordable. For a low monthly rate, businesses will benefit from unlimited users, unlimited projects, and more. Other tools on the market can get pretty pricey when you’re paying per user. But with Basecamp, you’ll pay the same rate whether you have ten users or over 100. The Bad
Limited Project Views: In terms of project management tools, Basecamp is basically a powerful to-do list for task management. The calendar view is helpful, but it’s not quite the same as using a Kanban board or Gantt chart for project management. You could always use a third-party integration or add-on with these types of tools. But that’s an extra step and added cost. Lots of other project management tools out there include these features without the need for an add-on.
Can’t Prioritize Tasks: Aside from changing the due dates, there’s no way to assign priority levels to tasks. So, a user with a long to-do list could ultimately work on low-priority tasks over high-priority tasks if they’re not careful. This typically isn’t a problem with smaller projects and basic tasks since it’s obvious what’s most important. But at scale, this could become a problem for some businesses. Limited Project Tracking: Earlier, we talked about Basecamp’s unique project tracking tool—hill charts. That and the calendar are really the only way to see the big-picture of a project. While hill charts are an excellent visual overview of progress, the actual status is subjective. These charts are based entirely on how a specific user feels as though they’re progressing through a project. Someone could say they are halfway done when it’s more like 20% in reality. This can cause some confusion and misinformation from person to person. Only Supports Basic Projects: Basecamp’s to-do lists, calendars, and team communication tools are perfect for small, linear projects. But for complex projects and agile project management, Basecamp might be a bit limiting. The software doesn’t really support major project adjustments in real-time. You can’t connect tasks to subtasks and see how a delay will impact the big-picture of a project. Again, this is completely fine for many teams. But it wouldn’t necessarily support the needs of a software development project or similar alternative. Basecamp Pricing and Options
Basecamp Pricing
Unlike other project management tools on the market today, Basecamp’s pricing is extremely straightforward. There are two packages to choose from—Business and Personal. Basecamp Business costs $99 per month, flat. The Personal plan is more limited, but it’s 100% free.
The flat-rate pricing is perfect for medium-sized teams. If you’re working on a team with just a few people, the per-user rate would be a bit high compared to other tools on the market today. But if you have 20+ users on your team, it comes out to less than $5 per month per person. Considering that other project management tools cost $20+ per user, Basecamp is a bargain. Even for such an affordable price, Basecamp is still loaded with features.
Not many project management tools offer real-time communication. The ones that do typically charge a premium price for an add-on module. But Basecamp offers messaging and real-time chat included. Is that chat as robust and user-friendly as Slack? Not necessarily. But it gets the job done.
The Basecamp Personal plan is not a viable option for business use. We’ll talk about this free package in greater detail shortly. Overall, Basecamp is a tremendous value. It offers more out-of-the-box features than most project management tools. The fact that they don’t charge a per-user fee is a huge bonus as well. If you’re on the fence, you can try Basecamp for free with a 30-day trial.
Basecamp Business
As previously mentioned, Basecamp Business costs $99 per month, regardless of team size. There are no hidden fees or any other costs.
The package includes all of Basecamp’s features. You’ll also benefit from plenty of “unlimiteds,” as shown above. This is unique compared to other project management software out there. Usually, you’d have to get to an enterprise plan to benefit from unlimited users. Those packages are generally designed for larger organizations and could start at thousands of dollars per month.
Basecamp offering unlimited users and unlimited projects for $99 per month is a steal. When you consider the team communication tools, the plan gets even more appealing from a value perspective.
That said, price and quality don’t always go hand-in-hand. While Basecamp has plenty of features and functions, its capabilities don’t necessarily outperform other tools in this category.
Does it have project management features? Yes. But it doesn’t have built-in Kanban boards or Gantt charts. Does it have a team chat? Yes. But that chat isn’t quite the best team messaging tool on the market. If you’re okay with these few limitations, Basecamp Business will still be great for your team. The low, flat-rate pricing is tough to pass on. Basecamp Personal
We can’t confidently recommend the Basecamp Personal plan for business use. You could potentially use it as an extended free trial just to get the basic feel of how the software operates, but beyond that, it’s just too limiting. At first glance, up to 20 users might seem fine for small teams. But you can only use this plan to manage three projects. Most teams will need more than that. One GB of storage space is pretty low, too. When you’ve got multiple team members uploading files and documents, storage will be maxed out fairly quickly. With that said, you can undoubtedly use Basecamp Personal for a small side project. Freelancers or students could use it as an alternative way to prioritize tasks and manage their schedules. But beyond that, there’s really no place for it in the business world. In terms of free project management software, there are better alternatives on the market today.
If you want a complete project management and team collaboration tool, stick with Basecamp Business. Comparing the Best Project Management Software
Basecamp is a viable option for business users seeking a single platform for project management, team collaboration, and remote work. Take advantage of Basecamp’s 30-day free trial to see if it is a good fit for your organization.
The flat-rate pricing and team messaging tools definitely make Basecamp stand out from similar tools on the market today.
With that said, Basecamp does have some limitations. It’s definitely better for basic projects.",Basecamp
Project Management,"Basecamp Review
Basecamp takes all of the core necessities of project collaboration and offers them for a simple flat price, no matter which features you use, number of users you have, or support you need. This product is perfect for large collaborative teams looking to scale without breaking the bank. However, Basecamp is lacking if you're looking for a comprehensive project management software with budgeting, time tracking, and invoicing features.
PROS Simple, flat-rate pricing model
User interface is easy to navigate
Convenient and comprehensive file upload system
CONS
Lacks other forms of task tracking beyond to-do lists
No reporting tools
Lacks budget or time-tracking tools
Who is Basecamp for?
Basecamp is the perfect tool for collaborative teams looking to track multiple projects and tasks, store and share team documents, and increase communication regarding task progress. This system works best as a collaboration tool for staff projects that do not require any budget planning, invoicing, or time tracking.
I've used Basecamp to track projects requiring lots of creative input, such as developing social media marketing campaigns, organizing event promotions, graphic design projects, and even company rebranding efforts. It's mainly a collaboration and planning tool best for internal team projects.
Basecamp's features
Basecamp keeps it simple in the features department and goes for a more collaboratively based approach. It offers task management, commenting, file sharing, and scheduling features that'll help you keep internal projects on track.
Management and planning features:
•	Task prioritization and scheduler: Basecamp offers a task list system that allows you to tag relevant users, comment on task progress, and share project resources (documents, graphics, charts, etc.).
Documentation features:
•	Document storage: Every project on Basecamp has a docs and files section where you can upload images, documents, and spreadsheets from your local computer as well as documents from your Google office suite.
Collaboration features:
•	File sharing: Each Basecamp project and task has a file uploading and sharing system so you can quickly share resources with the rest of your team.
•	Communication: Not only does each task in Basecamp have a comment section and messaging platform so you can communicate with your team, but Basecamp also sends email notifications whenever you're away from the app. That way, you'll never miss a task update or completion.
Budgeting features
Basecamp doesn't offer any financial management features such as budgeting, expenses, or invoicing.
Benefits of using Basecamp
Basecamp's strengths lie in its simplicity. Navigating to different projects and teams is a breeze on the home screen, with each project and team displayed in giant blocks listed in alphabetical order. I never felt lost while using Basecamp.
If you're looking for a collaboration tool that you can pick up quickly with minimal training or experience with project-management tools, Basecamp is the way to go.
The user-friendly platform is also easy to scale thanks to the flat $99 per month pricing structure. No matter how many projects you create, users you add to the platform, or features you take on, you'll always pay the same rate, making it the ideal collaboration tool for large project teams.
Basecamp's pricing
Basecamp is $99 per month with no contractual obligations, no user limits, and no tiers for features or customer support. This is perfect for teams looking to scale with lots of users without taking on any extra costs. This price may seem relatively expensive right out of the gate, but the more users you bring on, the more economical it gets.
Additionally, Basecamp has added a free version of its software for freelancers, students, families, and personal project needs. This version, named Basecamp Personal, offers users the ability to create three projects, add twenty users, and use up to 1GB of storage space. This free tier is perfect for entry-level users looking to test the waters before upgrading to the full platform!Usability
Basecamp's ease of use
When it comes to usability, you can't get much easier than Basecamp. Everything is clearly labeled with large project icons on the dashboard, and each project clearly lays out your message board, to-do list, automatic check-ins, schedule, ""campfire"" discussion feature, and file/document uploads. If your project doesn't involve handling money or outside contractors, what more could you want in a collaboration tool?
Basecamp's file upload system makes the ideation process simple and convenient. If I need feedback on a graphic, an email, or a social campaign, all I have to do is upload my ideas into a task and tag the relevant team members to let them know. Once tagged, those users will receive an email letting them know that I've pinged them in case they aren't currently on Basecamp. If I need to create tasks, it's as easy as clicking into a project, entering the ""to-dos"" section, and adding a new task with a due date and the relevant users.
Furthermore, Basecamp even offers a mobile app so you can keep in contact with your team on the go. I found that the mobile app functions almost exactly like the desktop version. The icons look nearly identical, the comment functions are the same, and the team pinging functions are intuitive, with notification bubbles at the top of the home screen.
Easy, easy, easy.
Basecamp doesn't offer everything you could ever want in a project management software, but what it does offer, it does very well.",Basecamp
Project Management,"Basecamp Review
Basecamp is a project management solution that's used and loved by many, thanks to its excellent communication tools, simple yet effective task tools and affordable prices.
Basecamp is one of the more unique project management apps available, due to its heavy focus on team communication.
Key Takeaways: Basecamp Review
•	Basecamp is a project management suite that values communication tools above task management features.
•	There are few native features in Basecamp, which means you’ll need to rely on integrations to get the most out of it.
•	If you work on simple projects that can be sorted and tracked with to-do lists, you’ll be OK; if you need tools to help you complete complex tasks, walk away.
•	There is no free version of Basecamp, but you can sign up and use the Pro Unlimited plan free for 30 days.
From our firsthand examination, we can say that Basecamp is not for the masses, due to its lack of task management tools. Still, Basecamp is powerful and does have its place. In fact, we’re sure that Basecamp could become a valuable platform for teams that need robust communication tools and simple workflow features. However, there are some issues that you need to know about before you dive in.
Basecamp Review: Pros & Cons
Pros:
•	Strong communication tools
•	Great PC & mobile apps
•	Simple pricing & plans
•	Countless users on Pro Unlimited
Cons:
•	Few task management tools
•	No free version
•	Frustrating user interface
Features
Basecamp is a project management tool that does not have the most robust lineup of features. Still, the included tools — especially the communication tools — work well and will help teams complete their objectives. Below, we’ll break down the major Basecamp features for you.
Basecamp Plan Features
Basecamp, which is the unimaginatively titled entry-level plan, features every tool and feature on offer. You’ll get unlimited projects, to-do lists, hill charts, a kanban board, campfire chat and schedules. You can also access integrations, training materials, desktop and mobile apps, two-factor authentication, and all communication tools. Basecamp plan members also get 500GB of storage for files and documents (which is a massive amount of storage compared to many other project management tools), speedy customer support, and you can invite guests for free. This plan is labeled for freelancers, startups and small teams, and we can’t say that we disagree with that assessment.
Basecamp Pro Unlimited Plan Features
The Basecamp Pro Unlimited plan offers everything found in the previous plan and expands on it by offering 5TB (yes, terabytes) of storage space, which should be more than enough for an entire team, and 24/7/365 customer support. Pro Unlimited members also get a one-on-one onboarding tour, and you can pay for the plan annually or monthly. The most significant difference between the two plans is that Pro Unlimited supports unlimited members, which makes it ideal for large groups. Aside from these changes, the plans are identical.
Workflow and Task Management Tools
If you’re hoping Basecamp is the answer to your task management prayers, we’ve got some bad news for you. While Basecamp can be used to manage tasks, the tools on offer are basic and few and far between.
Basecamp’s workflow looks like this: First, you create a project; a project board then greets you with cards for to-dos, docs and files, a message board, campfire and your schedule. You can create company-wide projects, projects for individual teams and even for individual team members. You can also create project templates, which can save you time in the future.
Next, you populate your to-do list. The to-do list is rather good; it’s easy to create tasks and assign team members. Adding due dates, comments and attaching files is straightforward too. Once done, your schedule and activity list are automatically updated. You can also add hill charts to your to-do lists that visually represent where your entire project currently sits.
The to-do lists are on par with those found in Todoist (here’s our Todoist review), which is great because to-do lists are almost all you get with Basecamp.
Weak & Missing Features
With Basecamp, you won’t find tables, you will not find a Gantt chart, and there’s no native support for dependencies or sprints. There is a kanban board (card table) and a calendar, but all is not well.
The kanban tool is disabled by default, which is for the best because it feels incomplete. Adding cards and columns is painless, and interacting with the cards is straightforward. However, the board and your to-do list do not update each other. Oddly, your schedule (calendar) will update with the tasks you add to the board, which leads to confusion. We suggest looking elsewhere for robust kanban tools.
Basecamp is not a task management tool first, and it shows. However, if you don’t work on overly complex jobs but need a tool to help you manage multiple projects and jot down and track tasks, you’ll likely be okay with the to-do list, board and schedule. However, It’s mildly infuriating that the workflow tools are not entirely cohesive.
Collaboration Tools
Basecamp shines when it comes to communication. Many tools allow you to chat with your whole team and individuals. There are even options that allow for collaboration with stakeholders. For example, clients can join projects as guests, be assigned tasks and chat with team members directly, which should help keep all parties on the same page and keep emails to a minimum.
There are four main communication tools. First, there are message boards where team members and stakeholders can post questions and receive feedback in a forum-like environment. There’s Campfire, a real-time messaging app. Pings let you privately message team members, and @mentions can be used in task cards.
Basecamp also uses “boosts” to encourage communication. Boosts are small 16-character messages that include text and emojis to show appreciation or encourage others. It’s a neat touch that helps build a sense of camaraderie, which is often missing in these platforms.
However, as good as the communication tools are, Basecamp is lacking in other collaboration areas compared to project management tools like ClickUp and its whiteboards and Notion (here’s our Notion app review) with its stellar real-time document creation features. We were expecting there to be more real-time collaboration tools in Basecamp, so this is disappointing.
On the plus side, both of Basecamp’s plans offer lots of storage space (500GB for Basecamp users and 5TB for Pro Unlimited members), which means your team can share documents, files and images galore. If communication is the most important thing to your team, Basecamp will wow; if you need more productivity tools, you’re better off looking elsewhere.
Automations and Integrations
Fortunately, many platforms can integrate with Basecamp, including Adobe’s Creative Cloud, Clockify, Salesforce, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Zoom and more. This is a good thing because, out of the box, Basecamp’s features are on the light side. There are numerous native integrations, but you can also use a service like Zapier for integrations.
Connecting Basecamp to other services is relatively straightforward and should pose no problems. Once an external platform is connected, you’ll see the icon — or door, as Basecamp calls it — on your project’s home page.
Automations are sadly lacking. You can set up recurring tasks and automatic check-ins, which create recurring questions for team members when they log in, but that’s it. Basecamp is very underwhelming in this regard. We are glad there are options for integrations that can help with automations; it’s just a shame that there aren’t more native options.
Reporting and Time Tracking Tools
Unfortunately, Basecamp only has beginner-level reporting and no native time tracking tools. For reports, you’re limited to the activities page in your project. Once there, you’re given the option to see all the latest activity, a team member’s activity or assignments, to-dos added and completed, overdue tasks, and upcoming dates.
The information within each category is presented in list format, which is easy to read, but not data-dense. There are no pie charts or bar graphs in Basecamp either. What you see in the screenshot is what you’ll get. There’s not even an option to export data, apart from printing or saving the same information as a PDF. If you’re a project manager who loves reports, you will have a bad time with Basecamp.
Admin Tools
Basecamp offers a fair few tools in the well-designed “Adminland.” You’ll find the usual gamut of admin tools here that let you add and remove team members, add administrators, manage groups and permissions and manage chat settings. You can also manage storage and merge team members, which lets one team member inherit someone else’s work. There are more tools available too. For example, you can reassign jobs, turn on two-factor authentication and manage company properties. There’s nothing special about the admin features in Basecamp. Still, there are enough options to help admins manage large teams, which is perfect because you can have unlimited team members with the Pro Unlimited plan.
Desktop and Mobile Applications
One thing Basecamp got right is its desktop apps and mobile software. Basecamp’s desktop application made our roundup of the best project management software for Windows. The desktop apps are identical to the web version; they’re silky smooth, responsive and have every feature minus the web distractions.
We can say the same about Basecamp’s mobile apps. You’ll find everything from the dashboard to campfire chat and message boards to your to-dos, schedules, kanban boards and shared files. The app is also perfectly scaled in landscape and portrait modes when running on phones. Touch implementation is also stellar. The app is just a joy to use.
Pricing
Basecamp has taken a simple approach to pricing. There are just two plans to choose from: Basecamp and Basecamp Pro Unlimited, both of which offer a 30-day trial.
How Much Does Basecamp Cost? If you choose the Basecamp plan, which doesn’t have a minimum user requirement, you can expect to pay $15 per user monthly. The Pro Unlimited plan has a flat rate of $299 per month when you pay annually or $349 per month if you pay monthly. The flat rate for the Pro Unlimited plan seems high, but you get every feature and a few extras over the base plan for unlimited users.
User-Friendliness
After going through the quick signup process, you’re greeted with a slick interface that looks friendly and inviting; however, you’ll soon realize that looks can be deceiving. It’s a good thing that Basecamp has a comprehensive knowledgebase. We’ll look closer at the interface and the training materials in this section.
User Interface
Basecamp’s interface looks great. The persistent top navigation menu is helpful, and the cards within projects that link to the main tools are easy to read and display a good amount of data. For the most part, you can zip and zoom around Basecamp efficiently; it’s just a shame that so many options are hidden in overflow menus.
After using the software for a while, we can tell you that Basecamp isn’t tricky to use, but it’s not as user-friendly as platforms like monday.com or Asana, where everything is laid out in front of you. As a result, you’ll spend a lot of time digging around and searching for anything unrelated to communication tools.
We have reviewed many project management tools and can figure out software quickly. However, Basecamp forced us to use the training materials to learn how to activate hill charts, boards and more. If this was our experience with the software, it will likely be yours too. Once you figure Basecamp out, you’ll be fine, just expect somewhat of a journey to get to that point.
Training Materials and Learning Curve
Fortunately, Basecamp offers a comprehensive training library. Jump into the knowledgebase and you’ll find plenty of well-written, nicely illustrated articles that guide you through processes step-by-step. There’s also a vast library of tutorial videos. The videos are well-made and easy to follow. Basecamp also offers many live webinars.
Basecamp doesn’t have a steep learning curve, but you must spend time with it to get the most out of the platform. However, should you become stuck or lost, our tests have shown that you can find the training you need with minimal fuss.
Customer Support
Basecamp’s customer support is good, but again, it could be better. You won’t find phone support, and there’s no live chat support or forums. However, there is a responsive ticket-based system. Pro Unlimited subscribers get 24/7/365 priority support, which will come in handy, and a one-on-one onboarding tour with the Basecamp team.
In general, don’t worry about customer support response times. Even though priority support is limited to the Pro Unlimited plan, we experienced speedy response times from the Basecamp team after firing off questions. Should you need help, you’ll likely get a response in under 24 hours.
The Verdict
Basecamp might not be the most robust project management solution available, but it’s a solid choice for teams that need basic task management tools and powerful communication features. If you have a large team that needs to collaborate with each other and clients while having access to simple task tools, Basecamp will fit your needs perfectly.",Basecamp
Project Management,"5 Reasons Wrike Is The Best Project Management Software
Professionals, marketing teams, creative teams- we all need a project management solution to organize their workload. You can’t just keep everything listed in a Microsoft Excel sheet. Well, you could, but it’s not very efficient.
There are many options to choose from- Asana, Jira, Basecamp, Trello,
A client management solution will not only help you organize all the pieces of a client task in one place, but you can prioritize activities, set deadlines, create recurring tasks, manage projects, and track files and keep all your client’s information and communication in one place so everyone is on the same page. And that’s just the beginning.
There are numerous options on the market that will help you organize your business and increase your efficiency. So which one should you choose?
Some teams choose their client management solution based on the specific elements they need. For instance, engineering and design teams might utilize a Kanban board which provides teams a way to instantly see what members are working on right now, what tasks they have completed, and what is coming up. These are great for teams that handle long-term projects.
At Interrupt Media, we use Wrike. It is our preferred client management software for a number of awesome reasons.
1. Wrike UI is customizable
Whether you use kanban boards, lists, or Gantt charts- Wrike’s project management tool can do it all. You can customize the UI to fit your taste or to better suit your project role and needs.
•	To begin, you can create a client project or a folder.
– Use Projects to manage tasks that are part of a larger goal. Projects can have their own attributes separate from tasks, like Status and Finish Date, which you can track.
– Use Folders as containers to organize and categorize work, making it easier to find and share information. Unlike Projects, Folders do not have attributes you can track.
•	From there, you can choose your default view as a list, a project board, a table, or a Gantt chart.
– A list is simply that, a list of your tasks organized by due date.
– A project board displays your project in board view and arranges them by status: New, In Progress, Completed, On Hold, or Cancelled.
– Use the Table view to see your tasks, folders, projects or Spaces in a spreadsheet format.
– Use the Gantt chart view to see your project tasks in a timeline view.
2. Wrike lets you control task management
One of the options we love is the ability to fully control tasks so everyone knows the status when they log into Wrike.
•	You can change the task owner when task dependency changes so that that person knows action is required by them to move a task forward.
•	You can prioritize tasks and assign them for the current week or a future date. You can also assign a specific due date.
•	Wrike also allows you to change a task status whether it is active, in progress, on hold, completed, or canceled.
3. Wrike permissions are cost-effective.
We love that we can add clients to project boards as collaborators without being charged for additional users. As a collaborator, clients can:
•	Gain insight into how a project is going.
•	Make comments to answer questions that arise during a project.
•	Access all related materials in one accessible place.
•	Provide missing documentation or materials.
•	Monitor progress and give approval to continue.
•	Project managers can easily monitor all activities to ensure projects are running smoothly without having to track down various parties and inquire as to “where they’re at” with a project.
Want to know more about the different Wrike licenses? Here’s an overview.
•	Regular and External Users: require a paid user seat. The number of regular/external users you can have depends on how many seats you signed up for.
•	Collaborators don’t require a paid user seat, but there is a limit on how many collaborators you can invite into your account.
4. Wrike is excellent for mixed-teams with mixed tech-literacy
Simply put, Wrike offers excellent ease of use. It’s very straight forward and options are easy to understand and implement. This is very beneficial for agencies who might have web engineers who incorporate agile DevOps into their workflows, but who might also have team members of a less technical skillset, like writers (that’s me), who need an easy-to-use system.
For maximum efficiency, everyone needs to use the tool, and with Wrike, that’s an easy task.
•	From the navigation panel, you can
•	Check your “Inbox”, where your notifications about tasks will appear
Check all tasks assigned to you via the “My Work” tab
•	Manage assignees
•	View activity stream to see the latest updates on projects
•	Check overall project progress via the “Dashboard” tab
•	See your project laid out over the month in the “Calendar” tab (Internal users only)

5. Wrike is a one-stop organization tool
No longer do team members and clients need to be scouring the cloud to find documents related to a task. No longer do team members need to go back and forth between email, chat, and Wrike. All of the moving pieces of a project can be conducted within Wrike, such as time-tracking, real-time status updates, and file sharing. Wrike is an excellent resource management tool that helps increase efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
•	Control how your tasks are organized
One of the best things about Wrike is that it really is a one-stop solution for task management and organization. You can organize your tasks by campaign, project, department, or any other criteria you can think up.
•	Assign work and approve it in Wrike
You can manage the entire lifeline of a project within Wrike. From task assignment to final approval.
•	Conduct all back and forth communication and notifications in Wrike
Questions about work, dependencies, client review- all of it can be done within Wrike via comments and the inbox. Team members and clients can be tagged so that they will receive a notification (of their preference) whenever they are mentioned in a task.
In addition, email blasts can be sent to a department for project handoff and delegation. Doing this automatically creates a task for them. Easy automation!
•	Keep all documents and files in Wrike

All in all, we think Wrike is the best in terms of usability, customizability, and all-in-one features. It simplifies project planning, increases the efficiency of workflows, and streamlines collaboration visibility.
We love the fact that we have complete control over task management which keeps everyone updated on project status and eliminates bottlenecks and hold-ups due to miscommunication. It’s incredibly user friendly so that all of our teams can use it effectively. Its cost-effective permissions have shown us an immediate return on investment and frankly, we just love that we don’t need five tools to do the work that Wrike does in one. Best of all? Wrike has a mobile app so you can use your valuable Wrike features on the go.",Wrike

What Is Wrike?
Wrike started out as a collaboration, work management and project management platform that enables its users to manage and track tasks, projects, schedules and other processes dynamically in real time.
With Wrike, collaboration over tasks is as easy as mentioning anyone in any task by using @. All documents associated with a project are stored within the project and all communication and discussion threads can be found in the same place. This level of organization makes it simple for new team members to get up to speed.
Unlimited tasks, unlimited subtasks and unlimited nesting make it easy and efficient to manage a portfolio of projects across the organization and it made it to our list as the best project portfolio management apps in 2024.
What Sets Wrike Apart
Starting at $9.80 per user per month (minimum two users), Wrike is more expensive than some other project management tools but its power lies in its ability to support both project management and collaborative work. Its Work Intelligence suite leverages AI and machine learning to:
•	Predict and manage project risks proactively
•	Create tasks and subtasks automatically
•	Streamline collaboration
•	Handle digital asset creation and management
•	Communicate quickly and effectively through automated response suggestions
Wrike’s Work Intelligence capabilities are available to all Wrike plans.
Pros
Wrike is a powerful project management and work collaboration software for businesses of all sizes. Its Work Intelligence suite utilizes AI to create tasks and subtasks automatically from comments, documents and more.
Cons
Wrike’s costs can be a limiting factor for midsized teams when cheaper options are available. Also, it provides financial management options such as budgeting and invoicing in high-end plans.
Wrike Core Features
Although Wrike did not make it to our list of top project management apps, it has some awesome features to help you manage your projects as well as tasks outside the purview of any project.
Role Assignment Features
Wrike has four access roles—Full, Editor, Limited and Read-Only—to manage access. However, the Enterprise plan offers up to 10 roles. Read-only access permissions are an excellent way to invite external or internal stakeholders who need to be aware of project progress.
There is a caveat, though. Role permissions can be set at project or folder level only, not task level.
Gantt Charts
Gantt charts are available only for paid plans. Wrike offers dynamic interactive Gantt charts that help you create milestones, manage dependencies and reschedule tasks in bulk via a drag-and-drop interface. When you import tasks from spreadsheets or other project management applications, the dependencies get imported automatically.
You can communicate with your team members from right inside the Gantt chart view, sharing task links, attaching documents and sending automated notifications for schedule changes.
Software Integrations
Wrike offers 400-plus integrations with a wide range of productivity apps and tools. The high-end plans offer native Salesforce integration, NetSuite and QuickBooks integrations via Wrike Integrate and Adobe Creative Cloud extension.
Dependencies
The task dependency feature is available for all Wrike users. It can be set from both Table view and Gantt charts. Of course, as Gantt charts are not available to free users, they can set dependencies only through the Table view. There are four types of dependencies that can be set for any task, using predecessors.
Budgeting
Budgeting is a critical component of project management. Although budgeting is a feature offered by many project management tools, Wrike offers it only to its Pinnacle users.
Wrike Pricing and Plans
Wrike offers a total of five plans, ranging from a basic free option all the way up to top-of-the-line enterprise options.
Free Plan
The Free account is not much more than a shared task list for small teams, although you can use it for getting a feel before you go for paid plans. The project progress, which can be tracked using different views through the Gantt chart view, is not available. The number of active tasks and subtasks is also capped at 200, which can be very limiting even for individuals.
Team Plan
The Team plan is a good starting point for very small teams (two to 25 is the allowed number) for planning projects and collaborating on them. You get the Gantt chart view, which is popularly used by teams to track their projects.
Business Plan
It is the Business plan where things start getting interesting as you gain access to work management tools. The Business plan has everything you could need for project and work management for large teams.
Enterprise Plan
The Enterprise plan is for teams that need advanced security options and expanded administration choices. Additional security measures include single sign-on with SAML, active directory, integration and two-step verification. You can customize the default types in your account and can even create new user types. You also get to automatically pull data from Wrike and export it to third-party analytics tools such as Power BI or Qlik.
Pinnacle Plan
The Pinnacle plan is specially designed for teams that also need advanced reporting and business intelligence besides advanced work management options of the Enterprise plan. Some of the tools include right to analyze, budgeting, HTML proofing, advanced resource management and locked spaces for confidential collaboration.
Wrike Setup and Customization
When you sign up for Wrike, you get a 14-day free trial of its Business plan, which should give you ample time to evaluate its features. No credit card is required for signing up. After the trial plan expires, your account defaults to the Free plan if you don’t buy.
The Wrike dashboard has a modern minimalist look with three vertical panes on the home screen. Initially, it can look cluttered to first-time users of project management apps but start looking at it from the left pane and things will start falling in line.
The left pane is the navigation bar, which gives you access to all your projects and teams. In the middle pane, you create tasks and subtasks in the appropriate spaces. You can think of these spaces as folders in your operating system Explorer window. When you click on any of these spaces, you see the details on the right pane. You can create and customize multiple dashboards and share them with different team members.
Besides managing projects and tasks assigned, Wrike also encourages you to manage your daily tasks. These tasks may be one-time or recurring; you can create them, assign them to your team members and set due dates.
Wrike Ease of Use
Wrike has an intuitive and modern interface. The default dashboard shows all your projects, tasks and spaces in one place so that the moment you log in, you can decide where to go.
Wrike Security
All plans come with enterprise-grade security. The Business plan also has folder and project permissions for added security. Enterprise and Pinnacle plans come with added security features such as two-factor authentication and 360-degree security, including compliance with five different security certifications.
Wrike Customer Service and Support
Wrike has a robust and comprehensive knowledge database with training videos, interactive training, a thriving community forum and the latest release notes.
Besides the typical email and chat support, Wrike also has paid support packages for Business and above plans. You can choose the package you want depending on your requirements.
Wrike Bot is available on its home page and most other main pages. But for many pages, such as blogs, it was not available for us. It collects email addresses and phone numbers of existing customers if support is needed. However, its response may be erratic. We didn’t receive any intimation from the Wrike support team even 36 hours after sharing details.
For new users, the Wrike Bot has free downloadable resources and an option to connect with the sales team.
Wrike Additional Features
Add-Ons for Premium Plans
Wrike also provides these add-on features for its Business, Enterprise and Pinnacle plans:

You get multi-project visibility and reporting in Wrike while developers can continue working in GitHub without having to learn another platform.

•	AI Project Risk Prediction: Uses artificial intelligence (AI) to raise alerts when a project is at risk of not meeting its deadlines.

Who Is Wrike Best For?
If you run a professional services agency or want a project management and collaboration software for your marketing, creative, product development or business operations teams, Wrike has highly customized features that are not available in any other project management app.
Wrike is also an excellent choice for hyper-growth teams that need powerful project management, work collaboration and advanced analytics tools to manage complex projects or a portfolio of complex projects.
Our Experience/Expert Take
Wrike is the right choice for teams that value ease of collaboration as much as project management itself. It has a plethora of features appropriate for teams of all sizes and project complexity. However, making the purchase decision can be a bit challenging with so many options available. It is advisable to contact sales to get proper guidance. Its prices are also steeper than many other options available. You should take care of budgets before signing up.",Wrike
Project Management,"The Pros and Cons of Using Wrike Software
To achieve their business objectives, companies require a well-defined plan to guide them from their current position (point A) to their desired destination (point B). Project management serves as an effective tool to facilitate this process. Nevertheless, project management is a structured discipline that involves a sequence of steps or processes, encompasses various activities, adheres to best practices, and demands resources and coordination. The complexity of a project determines the intricacy of these elements.
If you feel Wrike’s pricing is too high for your budget, consider looking at AceProject. By charging per project instead of per user, this software offers the potential for significant cost savings.
The use of project management software facilitates the adoption and implementation of project management practices. For instance, Wrike simplifies planning, scheduling, task assignment, monitoring, and team building for project teams. Furthermore, web-based project management platforms enable team members to easily share relevant information, such as documents, schedules, and contacts.

	Unchangeable default filter: The default task status filter hides completed tasks, and users must manually change the filter to include them. This creates difficulty in navigating and viewing tasks.
	Lack of a chat option: While Wrike allows comments on tasks within the context of work, users have to rely on third-party integrations such as Slack for easier communication.

Project Management,"10 Reasons Why Wrike Will Work Great For Any Company
Every agency needs a different type of project management software to complete its specific tasks, and handle heavy-weighted workflows and decentralized teams. The concept of an ideal PM system nevertheless remains unchanged, and expects solutions to be robust with features, well integrated and easy to use, but most of all affordable to ensure even startups can get a grasp of its functionality. For many creative agencies worldwide, the name of that system is Wrike.
Wrike is known to focus on the accomplishment of tasks rather than entire projects, and offer just enough workflow customization for clients to make processes more industry-specific. Experts claim Wrike to be the one-size-fits-all PM software, and point put important reasons to support such opinion. At the same time, they encourage interested companies to examine Wrike using its useful free trial plan that lets you try out all the key features.
1. You will understand it as soon as you see it
With so many PM systems available on the market, businesses are predominantly looking for such that can humble their cumbersome processes, and yet require no expensive set up or training. Wrike is exactly one of those systems which overgrew the practical usefulness of previous leaders on the PM market.
With Wrike, users can track time for each contributor, monitor tasks assigned in a custom calendar, and compare project accomplishment on a single page. What is best, even agents with no experience in digitized project management can run a large project, and manage to deliver it on time and in-budget. In most project management systems, this is simply not possible. You can read our detailed review of Wrike features to learn even more about what this software has to offer.
2. You get to tweak most of its functionality
What Wrike is mostly known for is its flexibility, as it allows users to customize workflows instead of relating tasks in dependency chains, and nest activity folders one in another to ensure visual hierarchy. It may sound messy to start with, but it certainly makes sense for multiple departments and teams that are not that strictly devoted to meeting project deadlines. Large teams collaborating with partners and freelance contributors honestly have no better option available on the market.
3. You can do everything with it
The truth is it won’t make sense to invest in a fancy PM system if you don’t get to perform all activities from it. With Wrike in action, you’ll get to monitor all tasks in real time, manage and share project-related documents, make last minute changes, and handle contact relationships. Besides, Wrike is easily incorporated in every ecosystem, which means that helpdesk users will be able to import tickets and email queries with a single click. In short, Wrike is the definition of a centralized and organized hub where you can manage all of your information. While there are certainly some solid Wrike alternatives out there we really found this system to be the best performer among its popular counterparts
4. There is no metric it won’t keep an eye on
Rather than simply listing values users don’t understand, Wrike compares metrics to help businesses make smarter decisions. For instance, it allows the user to see how long a task it taking to be accomplished, and compare that period to the estimated time values. Most PM systems (Trello, for example), require dedicated plugins to execute similar tasks.
To make matters even better, all Wrike estimates can be inserted in tickets, or extracted as reports in various formats. There is no team that wouldn’t benefit from such thing.
5. It associates project timelines with task dependencies
While it is very practical to customize your own workflows and relate them in the desired way, there are and will be companies that prefer disciplined visibility of who is doing what, and how he is doing that. Wrike is ideal for the purpose, because it automatically creates a timeline for each project ticket, showcases how tasks depend on each other, and includes all people that can contribute to them. The real value of task dependencies is that businesses discover what is pulling them backwards, and ideally make a screenshot of it for the team and the clients to familiarize with it.
6. There are task templates that can be duplicated
Speaking of flexibility, we mustn’t skip mentioning Wrike’s simplified drag-and-drop mechanism, thanks to which tasks can easily be transferred from one project to the other. The system also offers a variety of task templates and themes that can be moved and duplicated, again using the simple drag-and-drop functionality.
7. It integrates with Google Docs
Agencies prepare proposals and a number of other important documents using Google Drive, which is why they could use a system that can push those docs directly into their tickets, emails, and reports. Wrike is natively integrated with Google Docs, and a variety of similar applications (Gmail, Dropbox, Microsoft Outlook, Box, Apple Mail, and so on).
8. It eliminates all barriers between departments
The tricky part of managing projects in large corporations is giving all involved departments the role they deserve. Agencies, in particular, have a number of ongoing internal and support projects handled by sales or outreach departments, and they can settle for nothing less than perfectly smooth handoff. Unfortunately, most of them still mess this up because of not being able to direct the end client to the right department (face it: when was the last time you knew who is the head of the project?).
Wrike’s custom alterations help eliminate this problem, because projects are managed in such way that makes transition between tasks seamless for every observer. For agents, managing projects will also become easier, as their role will be automatically assigned on the project timeline, and they’ll be able to take action regardless of whether their department is involved. For more information about pros and cons of Wrike you can check out or detailed analysis.
9. It manages client relationships
Seriously, how often do you see a project management system that can do this? The quick status updates and project views typical for Wrike also collate client credentials and contact info, track their status and evaluate their activities, assemble deliverables, tickets, and all other relevant information. Afterwards, data is neatly stored under the Info view file in each project folder, made accessible to all agents you have on board.
10. It helps create and manage knowledge bases
Last, but not least, most agencies run robust knowledge bases where they gather all of their guides and instruction articles, attach documents related to internal processes, report on older projects, and store the HR profiles of their employees. With Wrike, all of these documents can be kept at the same place, backed up and protected, and foremost accessible from all devices.",Wrike

Being a Marketing Manager at ProofHub for more than 13 years, it’s my understanding that project management and team collaboration are skills gained through experience, which can be enhanced using digital tools. It is, thus, necessary to understand how a tool like Wrike functions at its core.
Understanding Wrike project management
The core system design framework of Wrike stands on four pillars: spaces, folders, projects, and tasks. These four pillars form a hierarchical structure from left to right. For instance, a space will include all the folders, projects, and tasks, you have planned for the year. Further, a folder may include projects you have planned for a particular quarter, as subfolders, and tasks will include information regarding particular task details, like starting and end dates, etc.
How does Wrike work?
Picture this: You are a digital marketer whose primary target this year is to increase brand awareness.
Here’s how can you create a workflow in Wrike for your goal.
Step 1: Create a space in Wrike called “Marketing 2023” to house all your marketing initiatives for the year. This space acts as the top-level container for folders, projects, and tasks.
Step 2: Within the “Marketing 2023” space, you will set up folders to represent different quarters of the year. For example, you will create folders named Q1, Q2, and so on. These folders will help you categorize projects and tasks based on quarterly milestones.
Step 3: Next, you will create projects as subfolders to represent specific marketing campaigns or initiatives. Each project subfolder would contain all the relevant details, documents, and communication particular to that project.
Step 4: Within each project subfolder, you will define and assign individual tasks that need to be accomplished for that particular campaign. This will include details such as start and end dates, assigned team members, and any necessary resources or dependencies.
Using Wrike, You can collaborate with your team by, sharing documents, files, and updates, and monitoring the progress of each task within the designated project subfolders. This enables you to work together efficiently and stay on top of our project initiatives.
Key features of Wrike
Here are my favorite standout features of Wrike; and yes, they are not at all limited to marketing. Customizable work scheduling: Wrike’s work schedule management feature takes customization to a whole new level. By allowing you to create different employee schedule groups, you can easily assign schedules to individual users. For example, you can design a work schedule group that includes weekends as working days for teams that require weekend coverage, while considering weekdays as non-working days.
This level of customization ensures that your task and project scheduling align perfectly with your team’s unique needs. It’s like having a tailor-made schedule for each team member, optimizing productivity, and ensuring smooth operations.

You can design reports and dashboards according to your preferences, displaying live data such as project progress and billable hours. This level of transparency allows you to evaluate your team’s performance and make informed strategic decisions.

Time Tracking: Time tracking is crucial for resource management, accountability, and billing purposes, and Wrike’s Time Tracker delivers precisely that. Employees can log their worked hours, breaks, and other relevant details, enabling employers to generate timesheets that display daily or weekly time spent.
This feature provides clear insights into time allocation and productivity levels, enabling better decision-making and efficient resource management. Additionally, Wrike’s built-in timer allows users to track time spent on each task in real time, enhancing accountability and facilitating collaboration within the team.

In my case, the primary concern is to keep track of the entire workload, and hence, I prefer the Gantt Chart view.

Users have expressed that the initial setup and onboarding process can be challenging, which might seem counterintuitive for software whose selling point is simplicity in adoption. Although training is available, busy professionals don’t usually have time to put their work aside for learning new software. Expensive Pricing: In terms of cost, Wrike falls on the higher end of the spectrum for project management tools. Although the software can be customized to suit diverse needs, many advanced features come as add-ons, which can significantly increase the overall price. Users have reported that by the time they include these add-on features, the final cost can be double or even triple what they initially expected. It’s essential to carefully consider the pricing structure and add-on options before committing to Wrike.

Wrike offers a range of pricing plans to suit different needs. Free plan: Wrike’s Free plan serves as an entry point for small teams and individuals. While it provides a centralized space for basic task management, it lacks advanced features. The free plan restricts the number of active tasks and subtasks to 200.

It’s a good starting point for exploring the platform, but its limitations become apparent as your team’s needs grow.
Team plan: ($9.80/user/month) Designed for small teams of two to 25 members, the team plan allows project planning and collaboration via Gantt chart view, a popular tool for tracking projects.

It caters to large teams and provides customization options and executive reporting. With access to custom fields, graphical analytics, and time tracking, this plan enhances project visibility and control. However, it comes at a higher price point, making it less affordable for teams on a tight budget.
Enterprise plan: The enterprise plan targets teams with advanced security requirements and expanded administration options. It includes features such as single sign-in with SAML, two-step verification, and active directory integration. Customization is taken a step further, allowing users to create new user types and export data to third-party analytics tools. While the enterprise plan offers comprehensive solutions, it may be excessive for organizations with more straightforward needs.
Pinnacle plan: Wrike’s Pinnacle plan caters to teams that demand advanced reporting, business intelligence, and extensive work management capabilities.

However, the Pinnacle plan comes at a higher cost, and organizations should carefully assess their requirements before opting for this top-tier plan.

The lack of filtering options was the second most reported issue by Wrike users. Speed
Wrike project management is slow to load and even slower to upload or download files. Since the application is big, the number of elements that need to be loaded before the application can run is huge.
Speed issues are the third most heard complaint from Wrike users. Confusing UI
The Wrike’s UI is at times very confusing and navigating from project to project or from task to task could be quite cumbersome.
The complexity of the UI make new user’s onboarding and adaption that much more difficult.
Task Prioritization
Wrike’s task management system lacks proper prioritization for tasks. It only has high importance setting for a task.
This hinders the ability to set priority for all tasks in the projects and guide team members as to what they need to do first.
Lack of UI Customization
Wrike does not allow the user to change the color, background, or other visual characteristics of tasks and projects. Changing Task’s Status
It is not easy or straight forward to change the task’s status in Wrike. This makes marking the task or project’s progress difficult.
In addition, you need to create a task and then change its status to a Milestone, which is not ideal! Price
Wrike is expensive compared to other project management applications in the market. The cheapest plan called Professional starts at $11.50 per user per month if you pay monthly.
The business plan is priced at a whopping $29 per user per month if you pay monthly.
To make it even worse, you can only buy in sets of five. So if you are a three-person team, you have to buy 5 seats.
If you have 6 people in your team, you need to buy 10 seats. This is extremely unfair to the consumer. For a team of six, you will end up paying $290 per month for this application if you need to use Gantt Chart or subtasks. Conclusion
Overall Wrike project management application is a decent SaaS-based project management tool.
The application has a rich set of functions and is built solidly. But its shortcomings are user interface and lack of a clear path on how to do things.
In addition, pricing is a huge hurdle for small businesses and startups.
If you are in the market for project management software, you can get an application that has more features than Wrike and it cost a fraction of the cost.
Check the Binfire pricing page and compare for yourself. Binfire’s plans differ only in storage and 24/7 customer service. So you get full functionality with all plans.",Wrike
