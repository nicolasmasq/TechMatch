3,Project Management,"What Is Trello and Why Should You Use It in Your Business?
Trello is huge right now and it’s only getting bigger.
They recently announced that they’ve surpassed 25 million users worldwide, making it one of the most popular productivity and project management apps out there.
That’s up from 19 million users just 1 year ago, right about the time they were acquired by Australian software firm Atlassian.
And it’s not just regular people using the app to meal prep or clean their home.
Trello is being used by industry-dominating businesses like Google and world-changing organizations like the Red Cross.
With that kind of global adoption, it’s got to be able to help you and your business get more done in less time, right?
That’s exactly the question we aim to answer in this post.
From what Trello is, to how it works, to its essential features, we’ll cover everything you need to know so you can decide whether you should use it in your business or not.
What is Trello?
Well, in Trello’s own words:
“It’s a collaboration tool that gives you a visual overview of what is being worked on, who is working on it, and how far they’ve gotten.”
Trello is like the Instagram of task management apps or the digital equivalent of Post-It Notes and bulletin boards.
It’s a visual stream of every task for every project in your business and life. You can plan and execute a new product just as easily as a family vacation.
The best part? It was designed for anyone to use, not just project managers – making it accessible for small teams of 3-10 to SMB’s with 250+ employees.
Trello’s simplicity means it’s easy to learn and use. No wonder it’s being adopted by small and large businesses alike.
But instead of just telling you it’s good, let’s show you how it works so you can see how good it is for yourself.
‍
How Does Trello Work?
Trello is based on the Kanban system of project and task management.
Kanban is a Japanese word that roughly translates to “card,” “sign,” or “billboard.”
Kanban was developed by Toyota engineers to streamline their production process.
Line workers at Toyota’s factories use a “kanban” (an actual card) to signal the steps in their manufacturing process. This allows every employee to quickly communicate with one another using standardized cues that everyone understands instantly – streamlining their workflow.
Similarly, Trello uses boards, lists, and cards to create a simpler visual system of project management.
These 3 basic elements of the app provide a visual layout of your work for high-level decision-making and ground-level action-taking.
Here’s an overview of each:
Boards : Boards can be created to hold all the tasks and relevant information for a particular product or project.
Lists : Lists represent categories within a board; they’re often used to represent a stage of progress (i.e. to-do, doing, done). You can create as many lists as you want to track ideas, information, and progress regarding your board (project).‍
Cards : A card represents a single, specific element of a project, like a task or idea.Cards are fluid, meaning they can be rearranged inside one list or moved from one list to another.They’re also versatile. You can simply write plain text on them, or you can fill them with checklists, images, and attached files.
What are Trello’s Project Management Features?‍A bunch of Trello’s features‍Beyond its basic elements, Trello offers a range of features that give you complete control over your projects and allows you to customize your workflow to fit your particular style or needs. Here are just a few of Trello’s top project management features:Home ViewTrello recently rolled out its newest feature, home view.Home view shows you everything happening across your boards, including due dates, card notifications (from team members), and what actions you can take next to move your project forward.It gives you a bird’s eye view of all your projects so you can easily reorient yourself with what you’re working on and working toward at any time.Team CollaborationThe ability to collaborate with an unlimited number of team members is one of Trello’s best features.Every board has a defined set of members that can see it and create or move cards between lists. You can set the visibility of the board so that your entire team can join the board at will or you can invite specific employees to collaborate as needed.You can delegate tasks by assigning specific team members to cards, then everyone can discuss those tasks in the card’s comments section.This makes collaboration in Trello seamless and straightforward.‍ChecklistsChecklists allow you to create subtasks and smaller steps within a card. They can be added, edited, or deleted at will.You can convert a checklist into a card if need be and assign team members to specific items on the checklist.This makes it super easy to break down big projects and tasks into manageable action steps.LabelsLabels are very similar to tags in Evernote or hashtags on social media.They let you categorize and sort cards in any way you want. You can apply an unlimited amount of labels to each card.You can simply use the color of a label to organize your cards or give each label a name for more descriptive filtering.And with label filters, you’re able to see only the cards you want to see when you want to see them for improved focus and productivity.Due DatesTrello’s due dates help keep you on track so you never miss a deadline.When you give a card a due date, you’ll get a reminder 24 hours ahead of time to help you complete your tasks on time.As with everything else in Trello, due dates are highly visual. They’ll appear as a tiny badge on the card that changes color according to how close you are to the due date.Grey means you have more than 24 hours to finishYellow means you have 24 hours left to finishRed means it’s dueLight pink means it’s past dueGreen means it’s completeDue dates are very effective at instantly telling you what’s the most important task you have to complete and what can wait.‍AttachmentsAttachments enable you to keep all the resources you need to get your tasks done in one place.Whether you’re pulling in files from your computer, Google Drive, Dropbox or any other location, it all gets stored neatly inside the card you attach it to.With this feature, you’ll never have to search through unorganized computer docs or random OneDrive folders to find the materials you need to complete your tasks.SubscriptionsSubscriptions let you receive notifications about anything that happens to a card. All you have to do is click the subscribe button on the back of a card.You’ll be alerted when someone leaves a comment, adds a due date, moves the card, or does anything else important.This is an especially useful feature for project managers who aren’t actively working on cards but want to keep tabs on progress being made on those cards in real-time.‍What are Trello’s Essential Integrations?‍Some of Trello’s essential integrationsTrello has a grand total of 87 integrations called “Power-Ups” that allow you to pair Trello with some of the best productivity apps out there.Here are a few of our favorites:‍Google DriveThe Google Drive Power-Up allows you to attach or drag and drop docs, spreadsheets and entire folders into Trello’s cards.This makes it possible to collaborate on your documents and tasks simultaneously with ease.SlackThe Slack Power-Up lets you send Trello cards to your Slack channels, set alerts in Slack for activity on cards in Trello, and attach whole Slack conversations to cards in Trello to make them actionable.Slack is an almost too-perfect pairing with Trello for streamlined collaboration and communication. (If you’re wondering what slack is, it’s high-time to get in the know.)‍Card RepeaterThe Card Repeater Power-Up enables you to set regular tasks on repeat such as weekly meetings, regular bookkeeping, or password updates.If you do anything more than once and you don’t want to recreate the same card every time you do it, this Power-Up makes it happen automatically.Zight (formerly CloudApp)Zight (formerly CloudApp) lets you communicate visually by making it easy to create GIFs, screen recordings, and annotated screenshots.Our Power-Up makes collaborating with Trello faster, easier, and more fun by allowing you to attach your visuals to cards.With Trello and Zight (formerly CloudApp), you can request design changes with an annotated screenshot, and fix bugs faster by visually explaining broken workflows with an HDvideo screen recorder, or celebrate a big win with a fun GIF.‍CalendarThe Calendar Power-Up lets you see all your cards with due dates displayed visually on a built-in calendar that syncs across all your devices. You can even drag cards from one calendar date to another to change its due date.This brings Trello’s visual workflow to a whole other level.GitHubThe GitHub Power-Up allows developers and managers to stay on top of their commitments by attaching pull requests directly to cards, start working in GitHub with one click from a Trello card, and associate multiple GitHub repositories within a single board.GitHub users can now feel confident working on multiple projects without falling behind or missing a commitment. (For the non-programmers reading this, here’s a post that explains what GitHub is).‍Trello Pricing‍Trello’s pricing options‍Now that you know how Trello works and what you can expect when using it, let’s talk about how much it costs.Like most productivity apps, Trello offers a free version with options to pay for additional features.Here’s what you get in each version (note: higher tiers include features from lower tiers):FreeUnlimited boards, lists, cards, members, checklists, and attachments.One Power-Up per BoardAttach files up to 10MBBusiness Class – $9.99 per User/per MonthUnlimited Power-UpsAttach files up to 250MBGroup and organize all of your team’s boardsControl access to your data with one click access removal for former membersControl who can create public or private boardsKeep company information private with restricted membership invitationsAdd personality with custom board backgrounds and stickersPriority email support with a human being and a guaranteed 1 day response time during business hoursEnterprise – $20.83 per User/per MonthSingle Sign-On available for all SAML IdPsEnable 2-Factor AuthenticationReceive personalized onboarding assistanceGet answers quickly with priority email and phone support with responses in less than 1 business dayBe informed with comprehensive legal contract review and enhanced SLAFile encryption at restIntrusion detection with enhanced software monitoringCustom security review",https://zight.com/blog/what-is-trello/,Trello
4,Project Management,"10 reasons to choose the Trello app for your business
we use Trello, an easy-to-use tool that helps us visually organise and manage our projects.
Trello’s main strength is undoubtedly its flexibility, as it can be used by a wide range of people, from teams to individuals – making it perfect for companies of all shapes and sizes.
1. Trello is free
While some project management tools cost a lot of money, you can download and use Trello completely free of charge. Of course, like most things nowadays, you can upgrade your account with one of the paid-for options – but all the elements you’ll need are in the free version.
2. You can create multiple Trello boards
The ability to use multiple boards on Trello means that you can create a more efficient workflow, mainly when working across different departments within a team.
For instance, if you want to have the same card visible on multiple boards – so that more than one department can see it – you can copy it over. You can even share boards by entering team members’ email addresses.
3. You can add due dates and labels on Trello
Keeping to deadlines is crucial to the success of any business, so it’s essential to keep on top of your orders/tasks. Adding due dates and labels allows you to assess priorities or assign to different team members quickly.
4. You can add attachments and emails on Trello
Keep track of your key documents by adding files or images to your cards. This allows your team to see key documents assigned to a specific card. You can even add emails as attachments to cards either as reference or to prompt replies later.
5. You get your own Trello ‘Butler’!
One of the newest features in Trello, you can use the ‘Butler’ feature to bring automation and insights to your boards. It can help you perform simple tasks on a single board using basic functionality or supercharge your workflow using major automation across your entire team.
This is perfect for when your boards and cards have predictable actions that always follow other actions (e.g., When you create a new card in the ‘To Do’ list, Butler can automatically add the ‘Steps’ checklist).
6. Trello can save you a lot of time
Trello offers several different templates, and some of the boards have been created by other Trello members who know the app.
It’s a good idea to explore them, as it should help you better understand the app’s full potential and show you how others use it. Using one of these templates will also save time and help to streamline your processes.
7. You can comment directly on Trello cards
You can ask questions within the group and provide feedback or additional details on individual cards. Better still, if you press ‘Q’ on your keyboard, you’ll see only ‘your cards’ (i.e., the ones that apply to you) – which is extremely handy if your boards are bogged down with lots of cards.
8. You get Trello’ Power-Ups.’
Trello allows you to sync to popular apps such as Calendar, Google Drive, Dropbox, Twitter, and many more. These ‘Power-Ups’ will enable you to bring additional features to your boards and integrate your favourite apps right into Trello.
9. Trello is handy for HR
As well as tracking workflow, you can also use Trello to benefit your working practices. For example, identify tasks with your team members, track personal and team accomplishments, and establish short- and long-term goals.
10. You can be unique on Trello
Trello allows you to change backgrounds and add stickers to make checking in on your to-do list more visually rewarding.

You can quickly switch between 'list view' and 'calendar view' on the Asana calendar to see which tasks are due and when.Even though Asana includes capabilities that provide everything you need to stay in sync, some teams are looking for Asana alternatives since Asana project management has failed to become the ultimate solution due to its pricing and a variety of other valid reasons.Asana FeaturesCommunication ToolsYour inbox helps in tracking all your messages and their associated tasks.

ConsThe following are the cons of Asana:There is no simple method to keep track of all items across several projects that are due on the same day or week.Since this application is mainly text-based, it's common for the structure to be broken, a job to be removed, or the task's name to be changed.It does not allow you to assign multiple people to the same task.With so many duties in one location, the process might get slow.Because Asana lacks time-tracking capabilities, you'll need to use an external time-tracking program.ConclusionAsana is a flexible workplace content management system (CMS) that can be tailored to meet the demands of a wide range of businesses.

7,Project Management,"What is Asana?Asana is a work management tool. Some will speak of Asana as a project management tool or a task manager. And they are not wrong. But if you are using Asana simply to manage individual projects or keep a detailed to-do list, you are missing out on some important pieces of the equation. As a work management tool, Asana coordinates all work on your plate, pulls together specific projects and processes, and allows them to live in a single place giving you a single source of truth and next actions for you and everyone you work alongside. When running a business, a work management tool is absolutely necessary.Why use Asana?Recent studies show that knowledge workers, those who spend their days handling information, spend close to 60% of their time on work about work. So what is work about work? That would be the things you do before doing the actual work you should be doing to grow your business. This could be looking through email, searching for documents, looking for status updates about projects, scanning spreadsheets for information, or asking questions of a team member.Of course, this means that the actual work that moves a business forward – strategic planning, creating, marketing, selling – gets only 40 percent of the time in your day. This begs the question. How can I personally organize my work so that I can flip the script and move the numbers even higher? Perhaps even shooting for 80% of my work being this actual work that moves the needle and 20% of it being work about work. Researchers have also found that for the average worker, 3 working weeks per year are spent on duplicated work.3 working weeks per year are spent on unnecessary calls and meetings.This means that 6 weeks of your year could be recovered if processes were improved.Perhaps you look at this research and wholeheartedly agree. But you just don’t know how to get around the facts and make a change to how you manage your workload. That’s where Asana comes in.The Vital LinkThere are two very important pieces of the puzzle that all businesses much have in order to function and grow. DocumentationOne is a place to create, maintain, and store all documentation that the business needs to survive. For most businesses in the 21st century, this typically means a cloud-based drive such as Google Drive. It’s a place where documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and videos live until they are needed. CommunicationThe second large piece of the puzzle is a way to communicate with your team members and your clients about the work. For most businesses, this is typically email or perhaps Slack or another messaging system.It’s important to note that using Asana will not eliminate or replace either of these essential pieces. Instead, Asana links these essential pieces together to form a smooth and streamlined platform to manage all your work.Perhaps you have experienced what I have when working with a cloud-based drive. I find that the drive quickly becomes a huge mess of unorganized files. A dumping ground of sorts. In my experience, if you are lucky and persistent or both, you might be able to search for a document that you know is in there somewhere. Or perhaps you have your own personal organizational system to find the documents that you need the most. However, your disorganized teammate can never find what they need and you spend your valuable time helping them find the needed documents. Does this scenario sound familiar? When your teammate needs to collaborate, you receive an email with questions or information about the work with a couple of others cc’d. That email soon becomes an email thread that is hard to follow as the work progresses. At some point, someone on the email thread sends a Slack message related to the joint work. So you are tracking conversations in two places. Keeping up with the conversation about the work quickly goes off track.One place for all piecesBoth a place for documents to live and a place to communicate about your work are essential to running a successful business. Asana streamlines your work by acting as a link between both of these pieces. When you use Asana to link each piece of your work together, you will add documents (or links to them) right on the projects and tasks in Asana. In addition, Asana gives you a place directly on the tasks to ask questions, provide comments, link to other work, and even celebrate when the work is complete. This means that you have everything you need to complete the work in one place. And you have a history of how and when the work was completed. Everyone involved in the work has direct access to this information, providing a clear and transparent view of where the work stands.Top 6 Reasons real users choose AsanaAs we work with clients here at Tessera, we have found that there are many common reasons that teams choose to use Asana. Here are the top 6 from our clients.Work is scattered in many places. Documentation and communication happen across many platforms, causing you to stop and start multiple times. You can never get into a good flow of work because you have to leave where you are to search for something you need.People work in silos.Silos may be great for Chip and Jo, but in a collaboration context, they can spell disaster. Workers are unsure of what other people are doing and if they are duplicating the work of others. Having a single source of “truth” for how the work is progressing eliminates the feeling of siloed work.There is a lack of clarity on who is doing what by when.This causes stress for the person who is ultimately responsible for the outcome. There is a lack of clarity on how my work relates to the full project.Perhaps I have a few tasks to complete to move the full project forward. But I’m unsure how and where this fits into the full picture. Seeing the full body of work in Asana gives me that view.Work is falling through the cracks.Small pieces of work can easily be missed. Seeing the full scope and having my part assigned to me eliminates that possibility.There is a need to streamline repeated work.All businesses have processes, whether they are written out or in the head of the one who does that work. Once the process is written, it can easily be templated in Asana to cut the time needed to do the task and makes sure that it is done in a uniform way each time it is needed.",https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-asana-why-should-i-use-paula-holsberry/,Asana

You can add teammates as followers on tasks not assigned to them, to keep them updated and alert them if there are problems they can help with. Administrators also have privacy controls — you can add permissions and other privacy controls to limit access to certain work, or even keep some teams that do sensitive work hidden. Easy app integrationOne of the things that makes Asana so easy to use is its app integration. There are a number of apps that work well with Asana, but the most notable are:Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, Office365, OneDrive, and Adobe Creative Cloud for file creation and sharingSlack, Gmail, Outlook, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Power BI for communicationHarvest, a built-in time tracker toolHow to get AsanaAsana is available in three pre-set, tiered plans: Free, Premium, and Business.

9,Project Management,"What We Like About Asana (The Pros)Intuitive, Easy OnboardingLet’s make it clear, right off the bat, that no project management software could ever guarantee success. The human factor remains essential and yet rarely acknowledged in discussions of similar software.You will still need to convince, encourage, and educate others to use Asana correctly. We’ve found that Asana is so intuitive, that onboarding was relatively easy among senior and new team members, for both in-house and outsourced tasks.UX and UIThe first thing that users praise is the UX (User Experience) which is a direct result of the UI (User Interface) and an interesting lesson in design. The layout is spacious and clean, the color choices are cool and pastoral, the animations and transitions are gentle and relaxed.Visually, Asana it manages to offer a compelling solution to the problem that has plagued management methodologies and software since they first appeared, namely, how to avoid making a series of intricately complex tasks seem overwhelming. I can’t think of a single team leader or project manager who would take this for granted; nothing sucks the energy and enthusiasm out of a person than when they are faced with a task that is presented in a way that feels overwhelming.Preventing this overwhelming feeling in the UX is precisely where so many other project management tools fail (despite having great UI) and Asana lives up to its name; Asana is a Sanskrit word used to refer to a Yoga pose used to establish a firm and relaxed posture. (In Persian, Āsān means “easy to do” or “easy to learn”).The ease of access to every variable of a task with a single click, in any view or display, is something that makes a project manager’s job of re-organizing objectives, re-assigning tasks and rescheduling deadlines, that much easier.A Feast of IntegrationsThe amount of software suits, apps, and services that can integrate with Asana, is astounding.So much so, that it would be a crime not to include this link to the impressively long list of app integrations with Asana.Briefly overviewing the main integrations, I would have to include all the popular Microsoft, Adobe and Google tools. Asana also integrates with most of the first-rate digital marketing tools and resources such as MailChimp, Hubspot Workflows. Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, and CloudApp, among other cloud services, are also supported.If you are outsourcing work to someone who prefers one of the rival project management tools, like Trello, Jira, or Zoho, et al., you needn’t worry. There are integrations for most of these too.Asana is Customizable and ProgrammableAsana has some delightful templates to choose from, though it shouldn’t stop you from getting creative and adding some personal touches to your workflow charts.Beyond the visual customization, Asana is a Representational State Transfer (REST), or RESTful, app. Meaning that by redefining certain representations and operations, you can program Asana to shortcut tedious tasks, or perform repetitive sequences in a single click. You can also link certain tasks to create specific status reports, retrieve data from other sources, and more, to streamline your pipeline even further.At Elementor we use Asana, and run the messaging and communications through Slack, using their own integration. The setup is slightly different in each department using it. For example, in the Content Department, we have projects set up so that they automatically require defining the content format (e.g. podcast, tutorial, article, news post, review, et.) and assign relevant tasks (e.g. research, writing, editing, video/sound editing, filming/recording, design, proofing, etc.,).We also have conditions set so that if a task is completed, or if any changes have been made to the workflow, the affected stakeholders along the pipeline are alerted automatically. Asana also allows us to create tasks with multiple dependencies, preventing us from running ahead before all the essential elements are in place.Basically, it works like a relay race, where an alert is set to pass the baton over to the next stakeholder as soon as the initial task is marked ‘completed’.What’s Making Us Reconsider Using Asana (The Cons)DuplicationProject duplication in Asana is a massive pain in the unmentionables. (There, I said it!)Should you want to create a second similar task (e.g. a generic release pipeline, or another tutorial video) you need to duplicate it, then open the copy, and erase all the data from the template form. There are duplication options under ‘Project Actions’ on the Project page (to the right of the project title). But the options don’t appear for the tasks (there is an option to assign copies of tasks, but it is still convoluted)Sure, you could create ready-to-use templates, mark them as such, and only copy them. But making each template takes time and, ironically, repetitive planning. Wouldn’t it be simpler to have the option of only duplicating a task template without the data?A great example of simple task/project duplication can be found on ClickUp.It’s Not for EveryoneAs I mentioned earlier, it is extremely important to find the Project Managing app that works best for you, your service, your team, your output, and your clients.This is why I truly appreciated reading comments from users, such as Ronny Hofsøy, who explained that he found Asana too task-oriented for his small business’ workflow. This forced him to find something more suitable (alternatives that he mentioned were SamePage.io, Timely, and ClickUp), despite having used Asana for quite a while.Indeed, we had to consider the pros and cons for quite a while before making the move and committing ourselves, and everyone we work with, to using Asana.",https://elementor.com/blog/the-tools-we-love-asana/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=13060922353&utm_term=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0_WyBhDMARIsAL1Vz8spXvmUdJ5fwdosZH6qbieig4Z4iz40MqjNeEkBgaElU1enceTcK8IaAmSlEALw_wcB,Asana
10,Project Management,"What Asana Is Good At
Feature-rich free plan: Many free plans for project management software lack the bells and whistles you need for success. But that’s not the case with Asana. In fact, of all the project management software we tested, Asana notches a spot at the top thanks to its free plan.
Most other PM software’s free plans are so restrictive that they’re not functional for small businesses. But Asana doesn’t hold back—its free plan supports unlimited teams, projects, messaging, activity logs, file storage, multiple project views, and more. If you have less than 15 users and only need to manage basic projects, you’ll never need to upgrade and can stay on the free plan forever. You can even integrate Asana with your favorite time tracking tools without paying a penny. This is a rarity for PM software as most solutions charge extra for time tracking and don’t allow integrations on the free plan.
Overall, Asana’s free plan is an absolute steal.
Multiple project views: With Asana, users can view projects and manage tasks in several different ways, including Kanban boards, lists, calendars, portfolios, workloads, and timelines. Other project management tools on the market only offer one or two views, so it’s great to see that Asana gives you every option you’d ever need. A 2015 study presented at the Graphics Interface Conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada found that “tools need to be personalizable to accommodate…differences across individuals’ [project management] behaviors”. The study also found that project management tools that grow with your team are more likely to help you succeed. Asana meets these requirements for success with ease. Each team member can manage tasks in a way that works best for them, enabling them to be as productive as possible. Switching between views also gives project managers a big-picture perspective on where the project stands. And you can even create customizable project dashboards that update in real-time. You can customize them as you’d like to see the most important information at a glance.
Process management automation: With Asana, you can automate those repetitive tasks and processes that drag your workflow down. The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) lists the benefits of automations. According to HIMSS, they help businesses save time and money while allowing employees to do more interesting work. And Asana makes it incredibly easy to do this. The workflow builder helps you set up custom rules, triggers, and actions. You can use it to set up basic automations. Think cascading due dates, assigning a task to the next person in the flow, checking a box, or alerting your team in Slack when a project is done. But Asana can handle even the most complex workflows that span dozens of users, tools, and tasks. Automating processes helps ensure things get done the right way while freeing up time for more important activities
Team collaboration: Most of the project management tools we’ve tried don’t offer enough collaboration tools, causing us to look elsewhere for software to fill in the gaps. However, Asana is one of the few that can act as a single source of truth for file sharing PDFs, JPGs, Google docs, team communication, group communication, and more. This is especially helpful for organizations that have geographically distributed teams. One of the biggest challenges facing a workforce of remote employees is maintaining communication and fostering team collaboration. Asana also made our short list of recommended tools for keeping everyone on the same page, no matter where they are located.
Users can assign tasks to team members, create task dependencies, assign priorities, set due dates, adjust due dates, and chat back and forth. This all occurs within a single, centralized task card. The calendar view lets teams plan around each others’ schedules and stay up to date on changes without needing to email back and forth. All project discussions and to-do lists are managed directly in Asana, too. Even better, the software integrates with popular email apps and third-party messaging tools.
Agile and scrum support: If you’re a fan of agile project management, you’ll be glad to hear that Asana is flexible enough to support the philosophy. From sprint planning, bug tracking, product launches, work requests, roadmaps, feedback, and tracking task iterations, you get everything you need to match how you do work rather than the other way around.
Countless PM tools on the market are too rigid and simply won’t work, but Asana is great whether you prefer a Kanban, Agile, or Scrum methodology, or something in between. Asana wants to make sure you succeed with Agile on its platform, too. Asana went so far as to create a glossary to help you match the terms Asana uses to standard Agile vocabulary. Asana also created a robust guide to help you set up your Agile projects within the platform. These efforts really simplify rolling out an Agile project management approach in Asana.
Versatility: Asana is a flexible and adaptable project management software that works for many different management methodologies, business sizes, and industries. Furthermore, it’s a great choice for marketing, sales, product development, operations, human resources, IT, finance, and more. It’s an excellent tool if you plan to use it across multiple departments and to facilitate multi-departmental collaboration because it’s flexible enough for hundreds of different use cases. From event planners managing thousands of attendees to marketing teams managing dozens of campaigns across different channels and sales teams tracking leads through the pipeline, it’s versatile enough to work for just about everyone.
Powerful integrations: Asana integrates with over 100 popular third-party apps like Slack, Dropbox, Google Drive, Zapier, Tableau, Zoom, and Salesforce. These integrations can really help extend the functionality of Asana. For example, your team can instantly be notified via Slack whenever a task or project is updated in Asana. It’s worth noting that some advanced integrations, like Salesforce and Tableau, are not available with every plan. Smart design: Thanks to the easy-to-understand layout for Asana’s dashboard, even newbies can quickly pick up the basics. Asana’s primary features are listed along the left side of the screen, so you always have access to them. Additionally, tabs across the top of the screen simplify navigation. If you want to display more information on the screen, you can temporarily hide the navigational features. Should your team have specific features you need to emphasize, you can customize the look of the dashboard.
50% off for nonprofits: You don’t have to pay full price if you’re registered as a nonprofit. A lot of software offers this, so it’s not anything special to Asana. But we love it and wanted to point it out all the same.
What Asana Is Lacking
Limited mobile app: Asana offers a free iOS and Android mobile app at every plan level. While the app is generally fine, it can be tough to use. Asana tends to work better on a full computer screen. The small screen on a mobile device just doesn’t do Asana justice. It’s difficult to get anything done beyond just quickly checking the status of a task.
Can’t assign tasks to multiple users: Asana doesn’t allow project managers to assign tasks to more than one user. In theory, this is designed to make it clear exactly who is responsible for a particular task. You can add a task collaborator or use subtasks to bring multiple users into the loop. Asana also lets you create copies of tasks for other users. But at the end of the day, tasks will only have one main assignee.
Email clutter: Many Asana users complain about the number of notification emails they get from Asana. Ultimately, you’ll have full control over your notification settings. So you can change that at any time. But it can be a bit annoying at first before you make those changes when your inbox is cluttered with Asana notifications. Fortunately, this is a simple fix.
Limited time tracking: If you need to track the amount of time your team is spending on various aspects of projects for invoicing clients, Asana may not work for you. Asana provides time tracking features in its Business and Enterprise tiers. However, you do not have these features in the Basic or Premium tiers, meaning you must track time separately.
Security: Although Asana recently added some impressive security features in its Enterprise tier, the other tiers aren’t as focused on security. In fact, if you are using the free Basic tier, Asana reserves the right to collect data about the way you are using Asana, including your mobile data.
Asana Pricing and Options
Asana Pricing
Asana has a package for everyone. As previously mentioned, it has an exceptional free forever plan.","https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/asana-review/#:~:text=Multiple%20Project%20Views%3A%20With%20Asana,portfolios%2C%20workloads%2C%20and%20timelines.",Asana
11,Project Management,"Monday.com is an online collaboration and work-management app. Some people may call it a project management app, but that's not its forte since it's not designed to help you juggle tasks and schedules across many projects with ease (although it does have Gantt charts). Monday.com is more like a collection of highly customized spreadsheets in which everyone on a team logs the tasks they need to complete and updates them with status reports and other relevant information. It has a modern, attractive interface and is fairly easy to use, but other apps offer a substantial free plan and more straightforward subscription options. We recommend Editors' Choice winner Asana for its incredible flexibility, good value, and free tier of service.
How Much Does Monday.com Cost?
Monday.com doesn't charge per person. Instead, it has prices for groups up to a certain number. For example, a team of up to five people starts at $60 per month. A team of up to 20 people starts at $240 per month. If you have 16 people on your team, you must pay for a plan of up to 20 people. If you have more than 40 people on your team, the website instructs you to contact the sales team for a custom quote. It's worth noting that in the last few years, prices at Monday.com have gone up considerably.
What Is Monday.com?Monday.com looks like it evolved from collaborative spreadsheets. Imagine Google Sheets in the hands of an extraordinarily capable designer. You access Monday.com as a web app or on a mobile device (iOS and Android).The initial setup is a simple grid. You choose what goes into it. What would elsewhere be called sheets are called boards here, and you can have more than one of them in view at any given time. Monday.com also shares similarities with kanban apps, and indeed. Each row typically contains a task or whatever it is you want to track. The columns indicate different attributes of that task, such as the deadline or who is assigned to do it. You define the columns as you like, and you decide what selections are available for each column.
For example, you could have columns dedicated to different states of completion. Let's say the task is to fulfill an online order. The first column might indicate whether payment has been received. Is it owed, pending, or paid? The person in charge of monitoring payments could update this cell. The next column might tell you whether the items have been prepared for shipping. A person in the fulfillment department could update that cell. Perhaps the column after that denotes if a shipping label has been printed. The result is that all the people responsible for ushering a sale from payment to shipping can collaboratively update the sheet and track the process.",https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/mondaycom,Monday.com
12,Project Management,"monday.com is an all-in-one work management platform that helps teams streamline their workflow, collaborate seamlessly, and manage complex projects effectively. This cloud-based platform was developed to simplify your work by creating helpful tools and applications for managing work.
monday.com started as a work collaboration tool but has not expanded into a versatile tool for managing projects, customer relations, human resources, software development, and other aspects of the business. monday.com calls itself a work operating system (Work OS).

13,Project Management,"Monday.com is excellent at tracking projects and other information all in one place. It has a built-in CRM that makes project management and customer information tracking a snap. Build your sales team’s cohesion with Monday.com’s collaboration tools, so you always keep track of contacts, lead scoring, campaigns, and much more. Let’s dive into how having a CRM and project management software combination can catapult your business ventures. Pricing: 4.5/5
Onboarding: 4/5
Ease of use: 3.5/5
Task management: 4/5
Collaboration: 5/5
Workflow and Visibility: 3.5/5
Pricing: 4.5/5 – Monday.com’s pricing is average for the project management space, but you are getting a lot more for every dollar you spend. The built-in customer relationship management tools make managing projects more efficient, and you don’t have to shell out more cash for a CRM software subscription.
Build your sales funnels, organize your contacts and leads with precision, and plan out your sales projects with project management features in one place. The Basic plan is $9 per user per month for a yearly payment, or $12 per user per month for a monthly payment plan. They have a minimum of three users required, so it really starts at $29 or $36 per month, depending on how you pay.
You can also add an unlimited number of additional users for $8 more per month. The next higher plan is $7 more per month for each user and gives you multiple project management views you don’t get on the entry-level plan, like Gantt, calendar, and map views. A free plan is available, which allows for unlimited projects. You can create up to 1,000 tasks, use templates and custom fields, and more for up to two users.
It’s not the best free plan, but it’s a good place to start if you want to get your hands dirty before going all-in. Now, we can move on to actually getting started with the software. Onboarding: 4/5 – Monday.com is situated between Trello and ClickUp in terms of a streamlined setup process. There are walkthroughs that show you a high-level overview to help you get acquainted with the software and how it works, plus pre-built project demos to show you how all the pieces work together.
The interactive product tour shows you how to look at the project dashboard and how to access the built-in project management learning center.
You’ll also learn how to rename a project, how to create and edit tasks, how to assign tasks, how to look at Gantt view, and how to see tasks assigned to just you. There are many templates to help you get started. But, unfortunately, a lot of the templates include features you don’t have access to on the entry-level tier. You can use them during a free trial but you can’t use them once your trial expires and you start paying for the actual plan. This is typical, but it’s not super clear which templates those are, either. You’ll just find out after the trial expires and you try to use one. When you first begin, choose if your plan will be for work, school, personal, or nonprofit use. Then, set your role in the company and choose departments to use the platform for, like sales and CRM, marketing, HR, IT, operations, or something else. Monday.com’s software allows you to dictate how you want to use it, so it can help you maximize what you’re trying to do. The marketing track, for example, focuses on reaching the best possible leads and prospects, while sales and CRM homes in on building your client lists and keeping clients well-managed and happy. This is very unique compared to other platforms that just leave you to make your business fit inside their software’s dynamic. There are several items Monday.com could have added to take this onboarding process to the next level, but they fail to offer more hand-holding on how to use other features. The learning center helps, but you have to know what you’re looking for or what you want to learn.
A little extra help getting set up would have imrpoved Monday’s score in this category.
Ease of use: 3.5/5 – We all want things to be simple. Monday.com only checked a couple boxes for features that make navigating the software pain-free. The overall platform is fine, but there were a few inefficiencies compared to the other platforms we tested.
For example, advanced search is available, but it’s kind of confusing. There are two search bars you can use. One is super basic and only lets you filter by project. The other gives you more control, but isn’t quite as advanced as other search functions. Monday.com makes using the software in common languages other than English pretty simple. There are 12 other languages, excluding English, that your team can use the platform in. There are other tools that cover more languages, but it’s a decent range and more than a mere two or three that some tools offer. Task management: 4/5 – You’ll be able to get more detailed with task management in Monday.com than you can with some of the lighter tools. It’s not quite as easy to master as Trello, but you can drill down into the specifics a lot easier with Monday.com.If you don’t have features that help you manage your tasks within a project’s lifecycle, you can pretty much kiss your organization goodbye. Monday.com being both a CRM and project management vehicle makes this somewhat intuitive, though it’s missing a few key features other providers have in their entry-level plans. In other words, we could see the allure of the gated features in the premium plans.
Collaboration: 5/5 – Monday.com does a phenomenal job helping your team work together. You get a built-in document system that promotes collaboration, with unlimited storage. That’s great for creating sales letters or SLAs on the fly for prospects and customers.
Workflow and Visibility: 3.5/5 – The workflow and project visibility in Monday.com is fairly restricted on the entry-level plan, which we tested, and there are some limits to premium plans that bothered our research team.For basic project tracking, Monday.com can provide helpful charts, but it’s certainly not a data visualization tool.The entry-level plan gives you dashboards and list and table views for reviewing project data.",https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/best-project-management-software/,Monday.com
14,Project Management,"The Cons or Disadvantages of Monday.com
While most users of Monday.com are satisfied with the software, others have specific needs or leave due to missing features. Some common issues include:
Per-user pricing limits: Monday uses tiered, per-user pricing, and adding users with complete collaboration permission incurs additional costs. Additionally, the more valuable features are in higher-priced plans, which may deter some SMBs.
Difficult to track time and expenses: Some users find it challenging to track time against each task and the cost for all the related tasks for a particular client. Also, Monday does not have a Gantt chart or plans to introduce one.
Interface clutter: A few users find the interface cluttered, disorganized, or confusing. Also, some visualizations, like the kanban board, could be improved. Users need more time to get familiar with the terms and functions to navigate the platform better.
Limited mobile app: Some complain that the mobile app, particularly the iPhone native app, does not update well. The dashboards do not have an equivalent view on the mobile app, and users unanimously say the mobile app needs to be improved.
Integration problems: Although Monday integrates with Dropbox, Excel, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Slack, Trello, and a few others, including Zapier, some users desire additional integration options, such as with Salesforce, Sharepoint, and other popular third-party applications. Also, they want better API integration.
The Pros or Advantages of Monday.comAlthough not suitable for every situation, many teams prefer Monday.com for the following features:Built for multiple users: The software allows more than one user to edit a list at any time, making it collaboration-ready. It also enables teams to send each other messages, which is helpful for remote teams.Great tracking features: Whether tracking tasks’ progress or issues’ status, Monday performs these functions well. The visual boards and user interface provide information at a glance, and color coding alerts users where immediate attention is needed.Alternative Views: While it lacks a Gantt chart, Monday provides a timeline view that many users find appropriate. It still enables teams to track progress and stay aware of upcoming deadlines. Other views include a kanban board and a calendar view.Powerful communication tool: The software makes inviting guests to view boards and timelines easy, whether they are part of the company or external partners. This feature centralizes communication and ensures that information does not fall through the cracks.Reliable project organization and management: Monday allows teams to organize their project information, resources, schedules, tasks, and communication in a highly accessible workspace. Additional features like notification and automation eliminate administrative work, enabling teams to focus on meaningful work.
Monday.com Use CasesMonday.com is used by hundreds of thousands of teams across 146 countries to manage their work successfully. Here are some of the ways that teams use this project management platform and collaboration tool:Daily tasks and ongoing project management: Teams create action boards with columns or pulses that outline their workflow. Work-related tasks move through a team member’s board for them to complete or delegate.Communication tracking: Rather than using spreadsheets or other documents to track communications, such as emails, phone calls, and social media posts, teams can use a board to monitor communication status and attach original emails.Creative project management: Graphic design teams can create a Monday board to develop and track graphic design or other creative projects. They can post upcoming work, schedule due dates, assign it to individual designers, and communicate through the board.Real estate property and client tracking: Real estate companies and agencies can set up a board listing all their properties. From there, they can track daily activities and related projects, such as leasing and maintenance. They can prioritize items, delegate tasks, update each other, and monitor workflow.Client work tracking: Marketing teams can track client projects from their board. The project manager creates tasks, assigns them, and sets the timeframe. Team members complete the assigned tasks, such as writing materials, shooting videos, developing promotions, etc.

15,Project Management,"Use Cases of monday.com
1.) Task Management
Task management is crucial to getting work done. Every industry has some form of tasks, and task management is a great business use case for monday.com! Everyone generally has a preferred way of tracking their work, whether it be sticky notes (as I’m guilty of myself) or a notes app of some kind. Whatever method you prefer, they work for you, but how do you convey what you’re working on to others? How do you know someone else isn’t doing that already? How do you ensure this won’t cause information silos in your business?
We use monday.com to run a brief morning meeting every workday, allowing teammates to align time, collaborate on ideas, and assign tasks. As a result, managers understand the team’s workday, have an overview they can trust and ensure everyone gets time face-to-face.
2.) Team Management
Team management is a vital element in any business in any industry. For example, without a properly managed team, you could have a store full of customers and no employees to work the register. Or maybe you’re a service-based company with appointments scheduled for today; how would you know who’s taking those appointments or is even available?
Being a manager is tough, and the transition to remote/hybrid work caused by the pandemic has only made it more challenging. Thankfully team management on monday.com is a breeze. Use customizable columns to build your employee database, set up team-based notifications, update or tag an entire team, and much more.
You should have a place to track and record completion for businesses where training, skills assessments, or certifications are required for employee onboarding. 3.) Project Management
When most people think of a business use case for monday.com, the first thing that comes to mind is project management, and that’s because they make it possible to manage practically any project in any way. With dozens of views and configurations, customized dashboard overviews, and limitless column structures, you can build any project management workflow you need.
Here at CarbonWeb, we’re constantly working on projects simultaneously. For example, in the last 30-days, we’ve given the website a facelift, pivoted our branding while developing new apps and products, and doing all this while still delivering optimized work environments to our remarkable client base!
When your business is workflow, you’d expect ours to be the best, but it turned out we were due for an upgrade ourselves! To give you an idea, look at our new Internal Marketing Projects Dashboard below. This dashboard pulls information from four different boards in our new project management workflow!
4.) Creative & Design Management
Piggy-backing off the project management use case, creative and design management, planning, and more! As I mentioned before about working on multiple projects, creative teams work on many different things. So managing all those things and ensuring communication through and through is vital.
Knowing the status of projects and who’s working on them is essential and can ultimately mean the difference between a marketing campaign going out on time or not. You can integrate with leading design tools like Figma, Adobe, and Canva too!
Below you’ll see a limited view of our To-Do Design board, which is the third step in our internal marketing project workflow! Here we’ve mirrored the project priority status from the overall project to ensure everyone working on the design task knows how essential that project is. Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
There isn’t anything more crucial to a business than the customers. With that, maintaining your relationships is vital to business growth. Most people use a CRM or customer relationship management system to effectively manage these relationships. What sets monday apart from most when it comes to the topic of CRMs is the customizability and sandbox nature of the platform. Creating malleable custom environments, lead pipelines, and outreach workflows is unmatched by any other software. Now add all this to your ability to integrate it directly with other systems in your Work OS.
Combine dashboards, unique user views, in-board dialing integrations, activity tracking, and automations with proposal generators, invoicing systems, and more. Only on monday can you create a genuinely end-to-end automated CRM. 6.) Marketing Management
One of my favorite things to do on monday is marketing management, specifically ad management. All the other boards displayed thus far are active in our workflow, and the next one is no exception. Starting as a marketing agency, we had to develop systems and processes for managing, executing, and delivering client work.
From my personal experience, everyone manages ads a little bit differently. At CarbonWeb, we wanted to ensure we standardized the process for our marketing team, so we could onboard clients, stay organized, and do a great job managing ads. Our process begins with a form to gather campaign-specific info used in content development and then delivered to an ad manager. This is all happening within our Work OS. So much so that when we need text written, it’s assigned to a writer automatically in that To-Do task management board we mentioned previously. Now that’s the power of automation!
7.) Festival / Events ManagementManaging festivals and events is a tremendous task, but ensuring a good end product is essential. With hundreds or even hundreds of thousands of people planning to spend their precious time at your event, delivering something worthwhile is your core focus. With travel plans, talent, equipment, vendors, caterers, contractors, staff, setup, ticketing, security, there’s a lot that needs to go right, with no room for error. It’s come to my attention that most of the events industry still uses excel at the core of their planning. I just want to ask why? Seeing what event planning looks like from the inside, it was crazy to see the amount of excel sheets necessary for putting on a successful event with headline artists. Grocery Management / Meal PlanningIn all seriousness, monday can be used for practically anything, and I hope I’ve shown that with this blog.Now, a quick story about this last use case.I created this on the weekend a few months back when I got tired of figuring out the different ingredients needed for the meals I like to cook. I live solo, so when I’m at the store, I’m the only one to remind myself to grab something. And frankly, I have a track record of being one ingredient short when I want to make something, especially waffles. (I have a secret recipe, ask me about it sometime.)Anyways, with my experience on monday, I figured, “Heck, why not make a board for this too?” and so I did. The kicker, our CEO Jack Kubicek, stumbled across it one day in my private workspace while doing routine account clean-up. The best part is that it got to stay because he thought it was a great board and a good idea. Now, this is an excellent example of “other” non-business-related use cases monday is great for managing. I was able to build a “workflow” to streamline and simplify a routine task with automation. This makes shopping easier and removes the friction of remembering what I need to buy without having to write a new list every time. I simply click a button to add a meal to this week’s menu, and then I have a list of ingredients I can check against my current kitchen stock!",https://www.carbonweb.co/8-business-use-cases-for-monday/,Monday.com
16,Project Management,"What is Jira: definition and key featuresJira is a powerful work management tool designed for software teams that want to organize and track their projects. It is an extremely flexible tool that can be customized to suit your team’s unique workflows, meaning that teams of any kind can experience increased visibility and productivity when releasing new products or software. As per Atlassian’s data, over 65,000 companies worldwide have implemented Jira for its robust flexibility to support any project and its extensibility to work with various integrations and apps.When asked what Jira is used for, the standard answer is project management. However, that’s not all that this software can do. Jira also offers fantastic bug-tracking tools, helping teams to practice problem-solving and risk management efficiently. Its variety of use cases, features, and expanding ability keep this software at the forefront of agile project management tools for IT teams globally.
Additionally, the best part of using Jira is its robust solutions targeted toward every department. This ensures that every team follows effective project management. Such teams include operations, marketing, HR, legal, finance, etc.Key featuresTo start with, Jira comes well-equipped with various features. However, if you still find anything missing, you can simply visit the Atlassian Marketplace. This online store is packed with third-party software and tools to complement Jira’s capabilities. For example, the Trello-Jira integration allows teams to use Trello for executing projects, automatically syncing data across the two platforms.Jira’s workflows also allow teams to check and track the progress of each task on the dashboard.Speaking about what Jira is used for, customization is one of its prominent offerings. This also goes into the Jira workflows, which users can customize according to their teams’ specific needs.For better progress tracking, Jira offers detailed and individual reports for projects, allowing teams to assess the status of each project and analyze critical insights. These reports are crucial as they help detect potential issues, overburdened team members, and project task timelines.Additionally, Jira’s automation engine allows teams to detect repetitive tasks and save time and manual effort. You can implement this engine to define trigger reactions and actions.Which teams could benefit from Jira today?As we mentioned earlier, Jira was originally meant for software teams to track bugs and other issues. However, as it turned successful and agile development became more widely used, Atlassian decided to expand the Jira platform, offering its tools and services to various teams. Currently, various teams can use Jira and its various tools. Let’s take a look:Non-technical teams - Non-technical teams mainly use the Jira Core tool, which is Jira’s basic project management solution, built for such teams. HR, finance, operations, marketing, and other relevant departments can use the Core tool for the usual task management like approving workflows, changing requests, etc.IT teams - IT teams use the Jira Service Desk, an add-on designed specifically for these teams. Helpdesk agents, call center managers, and other support teams can use the Service Desk for incident management, change management, and issue ticketing.Software development teams - Software developers or development teams primarily use the Jira software, which entails all of Jira Core’s features and also, agile functionality. Teams can easily use Jira Software for managing regular development tasks, bug tracking, and product management. Plus, the tool supports development teams that use Scrum, Kanban, and other switch agile frameworks.Agile enterprise planning teams - Jira also comes with a tool called Jira Align, mainly geared towards teams/personnel responsible for agile enterprise planning. It offers visual reports & tools and portfolio management and supports agile, flexible frameworks.What are the benefits of using Jira?Big enterprises such as Twitter, Lyft, Reddit, and Pinterest utilize Jira for their project management requirements. Needless to say, Jira Software is one of the most popular projects management tools. However, before we dive into what Jira is used for, you must first understand what benefits it offers that make it such a popular choice amongst tech organizations.Excellent reportingThe biggest advantage that sets Jira apart from other project management tools is its fantastic reporting. The Jira Software hosts 16 reports with elaborate progress statistics and insights to help software teams intricately analyze their projects’ performance.As such, Jira can help project managers obtain actionable data about performance on a task, team member, project, or team as a whole. Listed below are the reports Jira offers currently: -User workload reportTime tracking reportAverage age reportPie chart reportCreated vs. resolved issues reportResolution time reportRecently created issues reportSingle level group by reportVersion workload reportTime since issues reportControl chartCumulative flow diagramBurndown chartSprint reportVelocity chartRelease burndown
What is Jira used for - a detailed overviewNow that we’ve gone through what Jira is and its pros and cons, it’s time to see what it is used for and why it’s massively popular in the IT industry. Listed below are the most common use cases of Jira:Test case management and requirementsThere’s no doubt that Jira offers a robust hub for the coding, release, and collaboration stages of development. Additionally, the tools allow integrations with multiple add-ons for test case management. This way, QA (quality assurance) testing enters the software development cycle seamlessly, enabling teams to test efficiently and iteratively. QA teams can majorly benefit from Jira’s customized issues, workflows, and screens, as well as the automated and manual test case management fields.Agile teamsSpeaking about what Jira is used for, agile software teams mainly use it for its Kanban and Scrum boards to practice their agile methodologies consistently. These boards also act as task management hubs where agile teams can effortlessly organize their tasks into customizable workflows. This benefits teams by giving them transparency across project timelines and visibility into task status.Jira’s time-tracking capabilities and real-time performance reports also help teams track their performance over specific periods. Apart from these, Jira is used for email notifications, project-level permissions, and work logging by agile teams.DevOpsDevOps plays a crucial role in integrating and automating processes between software development and IT teams. This helps these teams to create, test, and release their software within shorter deadlines and more reliably than usual.In this context, Jira forms the backbone of Atlassian’s Open DevOps, an integrated and open toolchain. Throughout DevOps’s extensive lifecycle, Jira supports the seamless integration of internal and third-party tools. That includes GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Opsgenie, Confluence, and similar monitoring and documentation tools. This ultimately allows teams to focus on better practices like testing, security, automation, feature flagging, observability, deployment, and continuous delivery.Software developmentJira’s capabilities undoubtedly cater to software developers. Its roadmap and planning tools empower teams to manage feature requirements, budgets, and stakeholders from the first day. Additionally, integrating multiple continuous deliveries and integration tools facilitates transparency across the software development cycle. Once development is good to go, the Jira software can showcase the live production code status data.Apart from these, software teams can use Jira to quickly and easily deploy new features by integrating feature flagging tools. Jira Service Management, project backlogs, and sprint planning are some more ways Jira is often used in software development.Bug trackingWhile Jira has evolved by leaps and bounds, its core purpose of tracking bugs hasn’t faded by any means. When a problem arises while your team is developing a product, the tasks needed to solve that problem are known as bug tracking. To keep the bigger picture in mind, it’s always essential for teams to analyze any and every bug detected in a project.Once a bug is captured, Jira automatically allocates and prioritizes it, after which the project manager can track its progress until completion. Teams can also use Jira for bug tracking with customizable workflows, issue backlogs, bug linking, email notifications, project rules, and project-level configuration.Task and product managementWhen discussing what Jira is used for, its task management capabilities cannot be overlooked. The software simplifies almost every part of task management by allowing team members to create tasks and allowing managers to assign those tasks appropriately. Furthermore, project managers can add multiple details to the assigned tasks, like due dates, reminders, notes, status, and priorities.In addition, Jira also has a Subtasks feature that helps break down bigger tasks into simpler, easily consumable, and more manageable steps. Project managers can decide which members can see the progress status and also get notified upon task completion. Task changelogs, email notifications, task relationships, custom fields, and issue hierarchy are a few of the many Jira task management solutions.Moreover, Jira is also used for product management as it allows teams to customize roadmaps with projects. Once that is done, a team can use such roadmaps to have a rough blueprint of the project’s long-term view. They will also be able to track the progress and share it with other concerned team members.The best part about Jira’s product management is its ability to add minute details to roadmaps in order to consider dependencies and forecasts. This ensures timely project completion. If that’s not all, the software also has ‘live’ roadmap options, where various teams can collaborate within the same space by integrating the Jira roadmap into Confluence.Project managementIt’s no surprise that project management is one of Jira’s most prevalent use cases. This is primarily because of the software’s excellent capability to configure and fit projects. Managers can use various project templates or create custom ones to best suit their requirements.If you’re wondering how to use Jira for project management, here’s an easy-to-follow, five-step guide to help you do it seamlessly.Configuration - Firstly, you must select a pre-made Jira project template to start with your project. This template will allow you to configure your project as per your company’s operations. For instance, given your team and its needs, you may benefit from choosing the Kanban board. However, if the available templates aren’t to your liking, you can easily customize the details and create a custom template based on your needs.Planning - Jira comes with just about every feature you may need for project planning, whether it’s a roadmap or time-based software development. Start with establishing project tasks and breaking each task into smaller steps using Subtasks. The software defines a task as an ‘Issue’ and shows them on digital cards containing all its details. These can include priority status, deadlines, notes, progress, images, reminders, and so on. Jira can also create various versions of your plan, helping you evaluate best and worst-case scenarios.Setting up a team - After completing the project plan, you can start your team set up in Jira to start project execution. Project managers can decide which team members can only complete tasks or track progress and which members have complete admin access. The admin will be responsible for third-party app connections and settings configuration. Here, project managers can use Jira’s permission schemes to avoid manually implementing individual permissions.Tracking - After your team is set up and tasks have been assigned, the next step is progress tracking. Jira has all time-tracking abilities to help you check how long each task takes. Its detailed reports not only give you insight into completion times but also into missed deadlines and possible bottlenecks. Additionally, you can add pie charts and calendar views to track your projects better.Completion - Lastly, Jira offers two approaches for project completion. The first is to remove a finished project from active usage using Jira’s built-in ‘archive’ feature. This means no one can view or edit the project anymore unless they have access to archives. The second option is to shut off the project’s permissions. This will turn it into a read-only project, where teams can’t add tasks but can check them if needed.",https://www.turing.com/resources/what-is-jira-tool,Jira

18,Project Management,"How to Use Jira for Project Management
Jira is a popular project management tool thanks to its numerous capabilities. Learn how to use Jira to manage your projects.
Gone are the days when you painstakingly assembled a project plan in a clunky spreadsheet. Today’s project management software makes tackling projects a breeze. The hard part is deciding which tool to adopt.
Atlassian’s Jira software stands out among project management collaboration tools because of its popularity, particularly within the information technology (IT) industry.
It’s designed especially for teams employing an agile project management methodology, making Jira’s agile tools a natural fit for IT. My software development team and I used it for years.
This Jira tutorial helps you apply the software to your project.
Overview: What is JIRA?
It’s natural to ask, what is Jira? It started as an IT tool, but now it supports many uses, from traditional project management to an IT ticketing system. It covers the project management basics with a comprehensive tools suite, such as project planning, task creation and management, and reporting.
The Jira platform complements agile project management practices. Use Jira in conjunction with the agile ceremonies to get the most out of the tool.
I often projected my team’s Jira task list on a screen when we met for sprint planning and other agile events, and it worked beautifully to get the team on the same page while streamlining these meetings.
The key features of JIRAJira possesses many capabilities, and if it’s missing a feature you need, add it by visiting the Atlassian Marketplace, an online store where you can find third-party software to supplement Jira’s core capabilities.One project management example is the Trello-Jira integration. This feature allows teams to execute projects with their preferred tool, and data automatically syncs between the platforms.Jira’s abilities are so vast, it’s impossible to cover them all, but here are a few of Jira’s key features.1. WorkflowsJira’s project management capabilities rely on workflows. These Jira workflows represent processes in your organization, and control the rules used to transition project tasks to different workflow stages.For instance, tasks might begin in a pending stage. A task moves to an in-progress state when a team member works on it until the task reaches a completion stage, when the work is done.Jira allows you to customize workflows to meet your organization’s needs. If a completed task needs to enter a review stage, you can add that step. Jira comes with default workflows to get you started, or download pre-built workflows from the Atlassian Marketplace.2. ReportsAll projects require reports to track progress and deliver actionable insights such as when your project is at risk of scope creep. Several out-of-the box Jira reports deliver these insights.You can identify team members assigned too much work, discover project bottlenecks, and learn how long it’s taking to complete project tasks. And if Jira’s options aren’t enough, you can design your own reports.
3. AutomationUse Jira’s automation engine to automatically address repetitive tasks and processes, saving you and the project team time and effort. You define the rules that trigger automation actions, such as emailing the project manager when a task reaches completion.Jira comes with built-in automation rule templates so you don’t have to start from scratch. The automation also works with third-party software you integrate from the Atlassian Marketplace, so these systems remain in sync with Jira.How to use Jira for project managementJira delivers a comprehensive suite of project management tools. Features are available for every project stage, from project creation to execution and completion. These five steps summarize Jira’s key capabilities along the project life cycle.Step 1: Project configurationChoose a Jira template to set up your project. Templates are a quick way to configure your project based on the processes used at your organization.For instance, if your team employs kanban project management, pick the kanban template, and Jira will set up a default kanban board and workflows. You can then customize the default settings to match your team's needs.
Step 2: Project planEvery project requires planning. Jira offers the ability to sketch out a project plan for a time-based project, or a roadmap for ongoing, iterative projects such as software development.To build your plan in Jira, start by defining project tasks. The heart of every project are its tasks. Use a work breakdown structure to identify the tasks to complete your project before entering them into Jira.In Jira, tasks are called issues. They appear as digital cards holding the information required to complete the task.Describe the task in the card.Add documents or images that explain or elaborate task details.Mark the most important tasks with a high priority.Set due dates.Break up larger items into sub-tasks.Assign each task to a teammate, or put it in your project backlog to address when the time is right.Once you’ve created your tasks in Jira, assemble them into your project plan, identifying and mapping dependencies to ensure these tasks don’t become blockers for your team.Jira provides advanced project planning features that let you assemble multiple projects into one comprehensive plan, or you can keep projects separate.The software also lets you create different project plan versions. This capability allows you to model out various scenarios to assess situations, such as worst- and best-case scenarios for your project.Step 3: Team set upWith a plan in hand, it’s time to parse out work to initiate project execution. Before you can do that, every project teammate must be set up in Jira.Not all project team members need equal Jira access. Some use Jira only to track work and complete tasks, while the Jira administrator configures Jira’s settings, connections to third-party apps, and other functions that require unlimited access.This is where Jira’s permission schemes come into play. Permission schemes allow you to create a set of default permissions to apply to Jira users, saving time so you don’t have to implement permissions to users individually.You can set permissions so that some individuals cannot view specific tasks. This feature is useful when employing contractors or other Jira users outside of your company to prevent them from viewing sensitive business information.When your team is established in Jira, assign them tasks. Jira lets you monitor team capacity so you can assess if a person’s workload is too much or too little.Step 4: TrackingJira offers several tools to track project progress. Time-tracking capabilities enable you to track the time each task takes. If Jira’s default time tracking features don’t meet your needs, go to the Atlassian Marketplace for third-party options.Jira’s reports provide insights into team progress. Are tasks about to miss deadlines? Is a dependency going to cause a bottleneck? Jira’s reporting tools deliver the answers.For greater visibility and convenience, customize Jira’s default dashboard to highlight the key information around your project. Add a calendar view, a pie chart breaking down status across all tasks, the work assigned to every team member, or swap out components throughout the project to make the dashboard work best for your needs.Step 5: Project completionOnce a project reaches its goals and all tasks are completed, it’s time to wrap up the project. Jira offers two approaches. You can use its built-in archive function to close out a project and remove it from active use within the system.Archiving a project means it’s no longer available to edit or to view except in Jira’s archived projects section.You can also shut down permissions to a project so it’s read-only, preventing users from adding new tasks to a closed project while still enabling you to search for and view items in the project.Final words about JIRA for project managementJira’s rich feature set and ability to extend those capabilities through its marketplace make it a comprehensive project management tool. Jira pricing starts at free for teams up to 10 people. From there, pricing is on a per user basis depending on the desired Jira features.Yet among the project management frameworks, Jira’s greatest strength lies in its scrum support. If your team uses the scrum approach, Jira is a great option. If not, a Jira alternative may work better.",https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/small-business/project-management/jira-project-management/,Jira
19,Project Management,"What Is Jira?
Jira is a project management tool that enables project managers to plan, assign, track and review projects in real time. Jira started its shelf life as a bug-tracking tool, so it is still the best project management tool for locating, tracking and recording bugs smoothly.
Jira often gets discredited as being suitable only for developers but in addition to software development, the Jira platform supports projects of these types:
Service management
Work management
Marketing

All projects are not created equal. The needs of a software development project would differ significantly from a human resources (HR) or operations project. To provide the necessary tools and templates for different types of projects for businesses of all sizes, Jira offers these four products:
Jira Software: For planning, tracking, fixing and shipping world-class software
Jira Service Management: Helps your customer care desk track and fix customer issues quickly and effectively
Jira Work Management: Allows you to manage projects for any department within your organization, from marketing and recruitment to legal and operations
Jira Align: Built for enterprises, it connects all the teams so that they can be on the same page and get real-time visibility into all the projects
What Sets Jira Apart
Jira was originally designed for software development and bug tracking. It has features that are customized to issue tracking and bug reporting. Hence, Jira is the best choice for software development teams.
Jira software ships with an Agile flavor, which could be an additional advantage even for non-software projects. Agile methodology focuses on identifying and completing the most important tasks first so that the team delivers continuously and does not create a bottleneck. This is an approach that can help any non-IT project, whether it is a go-to-market or sales pipeline or recruitment and onboarding project.
Pros
Jira comes with two visually rich boards for tracking projects—Scrum and Kanban. If you wish to set deadlines and track progress of the project, according to those deadlines, Scrum is ideal for you. However, if you just want a visual way to look at your projects and tasks (issues in Jira), Kanban board is the way to go.
Cons
Jira is supposed to be more intuitive for developers in terms of its approach as well as labels used for tasks, events or custom fields. So non-developers may need to put in some effort initially to get used to the interface and its style of functioning. Also, for such a robust and feature-rich project management tool, it does not have any budgeting and invoicing features.
Jira Core Features
Let’s now dive into the core features offered by the Jira platform.
Issue Management
Anything that you need to track from start to finish is an issue in Jira. Every project is a collection of issues to be tracked. Issues are further broken down into stories and tasks so that large complex projects can be broken down into smaller manageable tasks that can be completed in sprints and delivered continuously.
Agile Development
Jira is built for Agile development. The software ships with Scrum, Kanban and bug-tracking boards so that development teams can choose a project depending on their requirement. Projects other than software development, such as Go To Market, Recruitment, Onboarding, Budgeting, etc., also benefit from these boards.
Jira ships with two boards—Scrum and Kanban—that make managing sprints for fixing issues very intuitive. Issues themselves can be tracked and logged using multiple project views including user stories and story points.
Bug Tracking
Jira was originally developed to track bugs in the software development process. The software comes with a template dedicated to bug tracking, which makes it very simple to track, record and fix them. As all the issues can be viewed in a single board, bug fixing can be prioritized in a single click.
Roadmaps
Roadmaps enable stakeholders to appreciate the big-picture view of any project, taking in the overall progress at a glance. This high-level, visual summary of the project’s goals, timelines and priorities enables managers to prioritize critical tasks and focus on delivering the most valuable work first.
Roadmaps also enable stakeholder alignment around project objectives, promoting transparent communication and accountability. You can even export them to other formats such as PDF or CSV for easy sharing.
Reporting
More than 15 reports can be created at every stage from planning and tracking issues to final delivery. These reports, such as a sprint report, control chart, resolution time report and time tracking report, help project managers gain actionable real-time insights into their team’s progress and re-prioritize accordingly. These data-driven visually rich reports can also be shared with clients to establish transparent communication channels.
Role Assignment Features
Although in the free plan, all users are administrators, for the paid plans, you can assign different roles to the users, such as developer, reporter and viewer. These roles are used to assign global and project-level permissions, customize notifications, establish email notification rules and more.
Software Integrations
Jira integrates with more than 3,000 integrations in over 35 categories ranging from project management and CRM to dependency management, security and workflow. To assist first-time users, Atlassian’s Ecosystem team highlights top apps that can be a great place for you to start exploring.
Jira Setup and Customization
When you sign up for Jira, you are sent a verifying link to your email. On checking that verifying link, you are redirected to a page where you need to create a workspace. Everything that you do in Jira happens in this workspace. All plans except Enterprise allow for just one workspace.
After creating the workspace, Jira tries to collect some basic information about you and your team to set you up properly. These are questions about your team, role, whether you are experienced in Agile development or not, etc. You can of course choose to skip them for now.
You can again integrate popular tools such as Slack, Google Sheets, MS Teams, GitHub, Jenkins, GitLab, etc. Or configure it later.
You can choose to start from a template or a blank project. If you start with a template, it saves time and effort because it comes pre-configured with common workflows, issue types, project settings, custom fields and best practices specific to the type of project chosen. Starting with a blank project can be time-consuming.
Jira Ease of Use
Jira is highly intuitive if you are or have prior experience being a developer. For non-developers, it may take some initial effort, but it is worth it due to its Agile approach to project management. Also, for first-time users, it is advisable to start with templates that come pre-configured with workflows and best practices. Jira has enough templates to get you started with any type of project.
Jira Security
Jira allows you to create and customize user roles and permissions. It allows people from trusted networks only to access your software instance. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using AES-256. Jira is fully compliant with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), SOC 2 and 3, PCI/DSS, ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27018.
For added security and compliance, you can subscribe to Atlassian Access, which includes single sign-on (SSO), system for cross-domain identity management (SCIM) and Active Directory sync. These services are part of the Enterprise plan.
Jira Customer Service and Support
Jira has a robust and in-depth self-service portal. You can access it from within the tool by clicking on the Quickstart button on the bottom right of your screen. It also has helpful short videos to get you started and answer any other questions you might have.
Each support request is an issue tracked according to its priority level, determined by the inputs you gave while logging the issue. Some of the other fields include customer time zone, affected product, addressed customer comments and BRT escalation.
Jira software provides 24/7 support via email and chat. Our support ticket was resolved in just over an hour. The best part was that its ticket receipt email was full of helpful links to webinars and knowledge center articles.
Customizable Templates
Jira has fully customizable templates for a wide range of projects from recruitment and onboarding to marketing and HR. You can customize the templates even after you have populated them with your own data. These templates come with pre-configured workflows and custom fields that follow the industry best practices for that project, which enables your team to hit the ground running.
Guest/Client Access
Jira user roles and permissions can be tweaked to provide guests or clients limited access to projects or issues. You can allow them global or project-level or issue-level permission, depending on their needs.
Who is Jira Best For?
If you need project management software for your information technology (IT) team, Jira is beyond doubt your best option. However, if you are willing to spend some time familiarizing yourself with the software, Jira is an excellent choice for any team that wants to adopt an Agile approach to completing tasks.
If you have very basic project management requirements and work with a very small team, you can start with its forever-free plan for up to 10 users.

20,Project Management,"In today’s Jira review, we’re diving behind the scenes of one of the world’s most popular project management solutions. Designed for agile teams, Jira (by Atlassian) delivers streamlined task planning, tracking, and reporting tools to businesses of all sizes.
It’s primarily used by software development teams, with specific tools for tracking software and app releases. However, virtually anyone can use Jira to prioritize and monitor workflows with Scrum and Kanban boards.
We tested the free version of Jira’s project management tool to offer a comprehensive insight into the system’s features, benefits, and potential pitfalls.
Quick Verdict and Pros & Cons
If you’re looking for a quick take from our Jira review, we think this solution is excellent for software development teams searching for flexible, easy-to-use, and agile software. It integrates with many solutions, including Microsoft Teams, and there’s even a free plan to get you started.
However, Jira might be complicated if you’re not running a software development company. Here’s a quick look at the pros and cons:
Pros:
Excellent focused features for software development
Kanban boards and Scrum boards for agile sprints
Easy to track, locate, and record bugs
Fantastic security and compliance capabilities
Great collaboration capabilities
Integrated automation to save teams time
Cons:
Slightly complex interface for non-developers
Missing certain features (like Gantt charts)
Jira Review: The Key Features
Jira is a project management tool targeted at agile software development teams. It was designed by Atlassian, who is also responsible for another popular task management tool: Trello. Jira started life as a bug-tracking tool for software teams before evolving into a fully-featured suite.
Jira features many of the project management capabilities of other competing tools, like boards, timeline views, and reporting solutions, but there are some bonus capabilities, too.
The core features include:
Boards and Timelines
The first thing we looked at in our Jira review were the boards and timeline tools it offers to help you manage and track task projects. The “timelines” give you interactive tools for monitoring dependencies, setting deadlines, and tracking release dates in a calendar-style view.
The boards give you various ways to organize your team and resources. There are two types of boards available in Jira:
Scrum boards: Ideal for agile teams working in sprints or time-focused periods.
Kanban boards: Drag-and-drop boards for managing the flow of work
In Jira, you can create multiple boards for each project, displaying different issues, workstreams, and information. You can also design cross-project boards with summaries for supervisors and leaders.
Projects and Planning
Projects in Jira are a collection of tasks you need to manage to achieve specific outcomes. Jira gives users a highly configurable environment, which they can customize to suit any team’s working style. Within any project, you can track issues, bugs, people, and workflows in a convenient space with dynamic visualizations. Jira even gives you a range of “templates” to start with.
Jira’s projects can also be broken down into various types, such as team- and company-managed projects. Whichever option you choose, you’ll get access to excellent configuration features and an easy-to-use interface.
Jira also offers access to “Plans” with some subscription packages. These pages draw data from projects, boards, and other aspects of Jira to create a customizable interface. They act like a sandbox environment for planning and experimenting in Jira.
Bug & Issue Tracking
One thing that sets Jira apart from other project management tools, like Monday.com, is its focus on software development. To help you keep track of potential issues with your software, you can monitor problems and “tag” them in your projects with different priority levels.
Jira makes it easy to categorize “issues” into different segments based on the work needed. Plus, you can create a set of “sub-tasks” for each issue. You can also monitor each issue’s “development status” in real-time.
Workflows and Automation
We were particularly impressed by the workflow management and automation options in our Jira review. In the software, you can design comprehensive workflows for each team member using a simple drag-and-drop editor. This makes it easy to map out every project stage for your employees, from initial creation to approval and more.
You can even design entire roadmap visualizations that help stakeholders see the “big picture” of a project at a glance, with timelines, goals, and priorities. You can also automate tasks with a simple no-code rule builder to save team members time.
Jira makes setting triggers and conditions for each automated workflow easy, with comprehensive controls and conditions, branching options, and more.
Reports, Dashboards, and Insights
Like most leading project management tools, Jira ensures you can collect data from your projects. There are various customizable reports, including agile reports, DevOps reports, issue analysis reports, and forecasts. You can also design real-time dashboards.
These dashboards are collections of data displays that show you real-time information at a glance. Like reports, you can configure these dashboards to display the data that matters most to you. Alongside dashboards and reports, you also get Jira’s “Insights.”
These pre-configured reports help you make data-driven decisions about sprints, backlogs, common issues, and project progress.
Integrations
One of the best things about using Jira for Project Management is that it works seamlessly with many other tools. There are more than 3000 different “Jira software apps” you can add to your system for extra features. Jira software integrates with various collaboration, UCaaS, and other tools through the Atlassian marketplace.
You can connect Jira to solutions like Google Workspace, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. You can even link your CRM technology to Jira so the platform can access insights about your customers and their journeys with your software.
Atlassian Intelligence
One particularly exciting new feature of Jira is the “Atlassian Intelligence” solution, which is included in some project management plans. This AI tool can generate and transform content, summarize content for you, and simplify workflows.
It’s a generative AI tool developed internally by Atlassian using OpenAI software. You can use it in the Jira project management tool and other Atlassian solutions to create automation, search for answers, automate support, and more. It can even help you review code.
Jira Review: Pricing and Plans
Now, we come to one of the most essential parts of our Jira review: the pricing. The good news is that you can access the basic features of Jira for free for up to 10 users. The forever-free plan includes unlimited project boards, backlog and timeline insights, and reporting. Plus, you get 2GB of storage, but you’ll only be able to access support from the Jira community.
Paid plans include:
Standard: $8.15 per month per user: Up to 3,500 users, roles and permissions, audit logs, data residency, 250GB of storage, and business hour support.
Premium: $16 per month per user: The features of Standard, plus Atlassian intelligence AI, advanced roadmaps, custom issue hierarchy, sandbox tools, and unlimited storage. You also get 24/7 premium support from the Jira team.
Enterprise: Custom pricing with all the features of Premium, plus support for multiple sites, centralized security controls and subscriptions, and enterprise support.
Jira Review: Ease of Use and Customization
As we noted earlier in this Jira review, the platform is a little complex if you’re unfamiliar with agile workflows or developer tech. It’s still reasonably easy to get started, however. After you create a workspace with Jira, the system will collect information about you and your team to help you configure the software to your needs.
You can also immediately connect your Jira project management software to other apps you’re using in this setup process, such as Google Sheets and Slack. Once you’re ready to start managing projects, you can use templates to get you started. We recommend using this approach, as starting from a blank page can be daunting for new users.
It takes a little time to get used to the project management experience on Jira, but once you’ve figured out how everything works, you shouldn’t have much trouble. The interface is laid out to help you jump between sections quickly. Plus, we loved the tutorials on the platform to show you how different features work.
The biggest downside is that much of the documentation available for Jira includes a lot of industry jargon and buzzwords. Plus, some of the words Jira uses to describe its features can be complicated. For instance, “tasks” are referred to as “issues”.
Jira Review: Security, Compliance, and Support
Since you’ll be managing a lot of data in your Jira project management tool, it’s essential to ensure that compliance and security features align with your needs.
Fortunately, Jira does take plenty of steps to protect your business and data. All your information is encrypted at rest and in transit using AES-256. Plus, the system complies with GDPR, SOC 2 and 3, PCI/DSS, ISO/IEC 27001, and 27018.
You also get access to two-factor authentication for better user protection and support for SSO. However, it’s worth remembering that Atlassian may track some of your actions on the app. This is pretty common, but if you’re concerned, you might want to check their approach to user privacy.
From a customer support perspective, we were pretty impressed by Jira’s approach. An in-depth self-service portal is packed with short videos and guides to help you get started. Plus, you can access 24/7 support straight from Jira’s team via email and chat.
Notably, however, the level of support you get and the speed of your response will vary depending on your chosen pricing plan.",https://www.uctoday.com/collaboration/jira-review-exploring-jira-project-management/,Jira
21,Project Management,"What Is Notion?
Notion is a cloud-based productivity and collaboration all in-one workspace tool. In this article, I’ll answer the question ‘what is Notion?’ and provide some examples of how it can be used for productivity, real-time collaboration, and project management in your organization.
Notion allows small teams of people to work together in real-time on documents, tasks, notes, wikis, and databases from different devices. For example, you could create a Notion workspace where your team will work on a project. The workspace can be used to store all the documentation related to the project. And team members can update the documents in real-time together.AdvertisementIn addition to being a productivity tool, Notion can be used for project management. For example, you could create a task list, a calendar for important events, a Kanban board to track the status of projects, and databases for work management.The Notion app competes with other productivity and collaboration platforms. There are many Notion alternatives, like Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Asana, Monday.com, Trello, ClickUp, note-taking app Evernote, and the list goes on. Notion is primarily an app that works in your web browser but there is also a mobile app available for iOS and Android.One of the key differences between Notion and Microsoft Teams, is that Notion allows you to freely organize to-do lists, databases, calendars, documents, and other components on a single page. This is in contrast to Microsoft 365, where apps like Planner and Lists are siloed from each other. Although that is gradually changing in Microsoft 365 as Loop components are introduced to Outlook and Teams. But more on that later.
How does Notion work?When you first log in to Notion, it can be hard to know where to start if you don’t understand how the platform is designed to work conceptually. Documents, to-do lists, and other Notion components are organized in workspaces and pages. You can create more than one workspace. In a workspace, you can create one or more pages that contain ‘blocks’. AdvertisementBlocksEach block contains some kind of data or media component. At the simplest level, a block can be a paragraph of text. Or it could be a media item, like an image or uploaded PDF document. There are many different types of components that can constitute a block in Notion. Here are a few key features:A to-do listA heading (H1, H2 etc.)A tableA bulleted listA database in table, board, list, or gallery viewAn image or videoEmbedded media content from other platforms like GitHub, Loom, OneDrive, Google Drive, Miro, Jira, Slack, and many other integrations.
Is Notion for free?Notion has a free plan to get you started. But it is limited to the number of blocks you can create and some features, like adding groups or team members are not available on the free plan. There are three paid plans:Plus (formerly Team)BusinessEnterpriseThe Plus Plan, which costs $8 per user/month, brings an unlimited number of blocks and file uploads, 30-day page history, and up to 100 guest users.The Business Plan is intended for companies that want to connect several teams and tools to Notion. For $15 per user/month, you get everything in the Plus Plan and other features like SAML single sign-on (SSO), private teamspaces, 90-day page history, and up to 250 guest users.The Enterprise Plan includes everything in Plus and Business. And you’ll get:user provisioningaudit logsadvanced security and controlsUp to 500 guestsUnlimited page historyAnd more.",https://petri.com/what-is-notion-a-guide-for-beginners/,Notion

25,Project Management,"The Cons or Disadvantages of Notion
While Notion is a powerful tool that offers numerous benefits to its users, it has some drawbacks you should know before deciding whether to use it. Here are some of the cons or disadvantages of Notion: Overwhelming to use: One of the main drawbacks of Notion is that it can be overwhelming to use. So many different types of blocks and templates are available that it can be hard to know where to start. This can make it challenging to use Notion efficiently, especially if you are new to the platform.
No goal tracking: If you are working on a large project, Notion may not be the best tool for goal tracking. While creating goals and tracking progress is possible, the platform does not have built-in features designed explicitly for this purpose. This means you may need to use other tools alongside Notion to track goals for large projects effectively.
No built-in reporting tool: Another downside of Notion is that it doesn’t have a built-in reporting tool. This can make generating reports and analyzing data within the platform difficult.
