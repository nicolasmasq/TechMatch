Sales Marketing,"10 Sizzling Salesforce Summer ’24 Features for Developers By Andrew Cook April 23, 2024 The sizzling Salesforce Summer ’24 release is just around the corner! Like sunshine breaking through the clouds, the highly-anticipated release notes are here to illuminate your day. This summery burst of features brings a wave of exciting new additions! Discover all the details to get ready for your instance’s upgrade, and find your release window here. But for now, let’s dive into the heart of this blooming landscape and explore the most captivating features and updates – crafted specifically for developers – in the Salesforce Summer ‘24 release. 1. Evaluate Dynamic Formulas in Apex (Beta) In Apex, there’s exciting news: Dynamic formulas can now handle SObjects! With the introduction of the `Formula.builder()` method, you can easily create a FormulaBuilder instance to tailor your formulas as needed. What’s even better? You can use the `getReferencedFields()` method to fetch a list of field names referenced within a formula. This handy feature streamlines your workflow by providing quick access to the fields your formula interacts with. Here’s a bonus: While formula evaluation in Apex is constrained by a character limit, there’s no need to worry about hitting the compile size limit. This flexibility allows you to craft complex formulas without being hindered by compile size restrictions. Let’s take a look at how this might work. Let’s say you want to calculate a potential discount for an Opportunity based on the Opportunity amount and a user-specified discount percentage stored on a custom field. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Opportunity opp = [SELECT Id, Amount, Discount_Percentage__c FROM Opportunity WHERE Id = :someOppId]; // Construct the dynamic formula using Formula.builder() FormulaBuilder fb = new Formula.builder(); Formula dynamicDiscountFormula = fb .discount(opp.Amount, opp.Discount_Percentage__c) // Hypothetical 'discount' function .build(); // Evaluate the formula Object result = dynamicDiscountFormula.evaluateWith(opp); // Cast the result (likely a Decimal) and use it as needed Decimal calculatedDiscount = (Decimal) result; System.debug('Calculated Discount: ' + calculatedDiscount); Here is what the above is doing: Fetching the Opportunity: We query for the relevant Opportunity record. Constructing the Formula: We create a FormulaBuilder instance. We assume a hypothetical discount function within the FormulaBuilder to calculate the discount based on the amount and percentage (you would likely tailor this to your specific calculation). The build() method finalizes the formula. Evaluating the Formula: The evaluateWith(opp) method executes the formula in the context of the Opportunity, substituting field values. Handling the Result: We cast the result to a Decimal for further usage. 2. New and Updated Items in Apex As usual, there are plenty of new and updated Apex items. First up is the Auth namespace which introduces several enhancements, including new classes, methods, and changes to existing ones. New Classes: ExternalClientAppOAuthHandler: This class extends the capabilities of managing external client apps. Key methods include authorize, customAttributes, and refresh for user authorization, attribute setting, and configuring token refresh. Auth.HttpCalloutMockUtil: A new utility class facilitating mock HTTP callouts, promoting enhanced test coverage. New or Changed Methods in Existing Classes: Auth.JWT Class: Several methods like getValidityLength, setValidityLength, getNbfClockSkew, and setNbfClockSkew now handle exceptions differently, throwing a NoAccess exception for JWTs generated using Auth.JWTUtil. Auth.JWT Class: The getAdditionalClaims method now returns additional claims for JWTs generated using Auth.JWTUtil, with claims formatted as inner lists converted to JSON strings for easier conversion into maps. In the ConnectApi namespace (also known as Connect in Apex), new classes, methods, and enums are introduced, offering expanded functionalities for REST API resource actions. In the DataSource namespace, updates focus on mapping external data types to Salesforce external objects via the Apex Connector Framework. New methods like currency, date, email, percent, and phone in the Column class enable the creation of new columns on a DataSource.Table. Under the System namespace, notable additions include Apex cursors for traversing large result sets, instantiation of FormulaBuilder, improved error handling for non-platform event sObjects, and new exceptions for cursor management. In the FormulaEval namespace (Beta), enhancements include new methods for retrieving referenced field names in formulas and setting context types for formula evaluation. Lastly, the Enablement namespace (Developer Preview) introduces classes and methods for creating custom items in Enablement programs. Key classes like EnblProgramTaskDefSubCategoryType, LearningItemType, and LearningItemTypeHandler facilitate defining exercise and learning item types, along with providing metadata information for custom learning item types. 3. Updates to SOQL As with Apex, SOQL has also received some love with plenty of enhancements in the upcoming release that may impact existing code reliant on older errors and functionality. Changed Error Codes: The error code `MALFORMED_QUERY` now replaces `D_QUERY_FIILTER_OPERATOR`. Changed Functionality: Negative currency values are now permissible in queries, such as: 1 SELECT Name FROM Invoice__c WHERE Balance__c < USD-500 Changed Error Messages: Below are examples illustrating how error messages have evolved: Invalid SOQL queries: 1 SELECT Id FROM Account USING everything Old: unexpected token: ‘<EOF>’ New: unexpected token: ‘everything’ Quotes surrounding an unexpected token: 1 2 3 4 ELECT annualrevenue , parentid FROM Account WHERE (isDeleted = false AND NumberOfEmployees != 100) OR (isDeleted = false AND Site = '999') AND ParentId = '000000000000000' LIMIT 50000 OFFSET 0 Old: unexpected token: AND New: unexpected token: ‘AND’ Using NULL literals in WHERE statements: 1 2 SELECT Id, Name, Country__c, State__c, City__c, PAN_Number__c FROM Account WHERE PAN_Number__c like NULL AND Name LIKE '%a%' Old: invalid operator New: unexpected token: ‘OR’ More than two nested functions: 1 SELECT convertCurrency(calendar_year(convertTimezone(lastmodifieddate))) FROM account Old: expecting a right parentheses, found ‘(’ New: unexpected token: ‘(’ Invalid datetime literals: 1 SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE SystemModstamp > 2020-12-12t12:12:00-25:00 Old: line 1:67 mismatched character ‘5’ expecting set ‘0’..’3′ New: Invalid datetime: 2020-12-12t12:12:00-25:00 Using “WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED” without a proper Apex context setup: 1 SELECT Id FROM Account WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED Old: SECURITY_ENFORCED not allowed in this context New: rule soqlWithIdentifierClause failed predicate: {this.helper.allowApexSyntax() && this.helper.hasApexContext()} Be mindful that running SOQL queries against DMOs may consume Data Services credits from your Data Cloud subscription. Ensure caution when utilizing features like ‘FOR’ loops, query locators, recursion, or any mechanism resulting in multiple queries to Data Cloud. For comprehensive information on usage billing, refer to the Data Cloud Billable Usage Types documentation. 4. Data Cloud Objects – Now With SOQL! Static SOQL is now an available option for querying Data Cloud data model objects (DMOs), providing a more direct alternative to using dynamic SOQL or ConnectAPI. This enhancement allows for more efficient and straightforward querying of DMOs. Additionally, starting from API version 61.0, SOQL queries using Apex `Database.QueryLocator` or within `FOR` loops are supported. Prior to version 61.0, only the first 201 records were returned in such queries. Batch Apex is currently restricted from using QueryLocators with DMOs but is supported when using Iterable. This change applies across all Salesforce editions. Here’s an example demonstrating the usage of static SOQL with the `UnifiedIndividual__dlm` Data Cloud object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // Static SOQL example List<UnifiedIndividual__dlm> unifiedIndividuals = [ SELECT Id, ssot__FirstName__c, ssot__LastName__c, ssot__Email__c, ssot__SkyMilesBalance__c, ssot__MedallionStatus__c FROM UnifiedIndividual__dlm WHERE ssot__CompanyId__c = :companyId ]; However, it’s crucial to note that running SOQL queries against DMOs can consume Data Services credits from your Data Cloud subscription. Ensure caution when utilizing features like `FOR` loops, query locators, recursion, or any mechanism resulting in multiple queries to Data Cloud. For comprehensive information on usage billing, refer to the Data Cloud Billable Usage Types documentation. 5. Scratch Org Snapshots for Efficient Configuration in Salesforce – Now GA We highlighted this feature going into beta in the Spring ‘24 release. Well, that beta seemed to go pretty well as this feature is now being made generally available! Scratch Org Snapshots allow users to capture a snapshot of a scratch org’s configuration at a specific moment in time. This snapshot can then be used to replicate the same configuration in other scratch orgs, streamlining the process of reproducing specific setups. Scratch Org Snapshots are available in both Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic, across Developer, Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited editions. To access this feature, the Dev Hub org needs to be upgraded to the Spring ’24 release. This feature simplifies the traditionally manual and time-consuming process of setting up scratch orgs with project dependencies. Users can activate Scratch Org Snapshots in their Dev Hub org, and Salesforce CLI commands such as “org create snapshot” and “org list snapshot” can be used to manage and create snapshots. Ultimately, Scratch Org Snapshots boost efficiency by facilitating the rapid replication of scratch orgs with specific project dependencies, reducing the need for repetitive manual configurations. 6. Run Flows in Bot User Context – Enforced With this update turned on, when a bot starts a process, it uses the user profile and permission sets linked to the bot to decide what data it can access and change. Before this update, processes started by a bot worked in system mode, giving them permission to access and change any data. Now, processes are started by a bot work in user mode. When a bot starts a process, the permissions linked to the bot and any sharing rules determine what data the process can access and change. For instance, let’s say the bot triggers the Update Account Type process: 1 POST /v54.0/actions/custom/flow/Update_Account_Type This update enhances security in Salesforce by preventing bots from accidentally creating or changing records they shouldn’t. 7. Allow Only Trusted Cross-Org Redirections – Enforced To safeguard your users and network, ensure that you include the specific Salesforce org URLs you trust in the Trusted URLs for Redirects allowlist. Without being on this list, users won’t be able to navigate to a different Salesforce org, including its publicly accessible pages and content, from your org. Any redirections to other Salesforce orgs will be restricted unless the URL is listed in the Trusted URLs for Redirects allowlist. Essentially, users won’t be able to reach a different Salesforce org’s content from your org unless the URL is deemed trustworthy. This measure aims to protect users from potential security threats, permitting links, actions, or processes to direct users to another Salesforce org only if the target URL is trusted. This change specifically affects situations where users are directed to a different Salesforce org, such as when clicking a link to an Experience Cloud site hosted in another Salesforce org. Once this update is enforced, such redirections will be permanently blocked. The following types of URLs are most commonly impacted: Hard-coded links leading to a different org, like a link pointing to a production URL in a sandbox environment. Processes that guide users to another org, such as a workflow in production directing users to a sandbox to perform a task. Links redirecting users to another production org, especially relevant if you manage multiple production orgs. Notably, this change doesn’t affect access to URLs within the same org with different domains, such as links from a Lightning page to a file. Users will always be able to access URLs within the org where they are logged in. READ MORE: Allow Only Trusted Cross-Org Redirections (Release Update) 8. Enable EmailSimple Invocable Action to Respect Organization-Wide Profile Settings With this update activated, the EmailSimple invocable action follows the email address profile settings set at the organization level. Once enabled, any usage of the EmailSimple invocable action will comply with the organization-wide email address profile settings. Previously ignored, the profile restrictions within your organization-wide email address settings now take effect. Any features utilizing EmailSimple for organization-wide email addresses will be affected if they’re executed within a user context and the user’s profile doesn’t align. 9. Lightning Component Updates Updates to Lightning Components are aplenty in this release. Below are some of these updates, along with some recommendations on how you may want to address them: Lightning Web Components (LWC) Accessibility Enhancements: Many LWC components (combobox, datatable, helptext, input, progress-indicator, etc.) have improved keyboard navigation, error handling, assistive text, and ARIA attributes for a more inclusive user experience. New Attributes: Gain more control over component behavior with new attributes like: aria-describedby and aria-labelledby (select, textarea) for better accessibility date-access-key and time-access-key (input type=”datetime”) for keyboard shortcuts show-compact-address, subpremise, subpremise-label, and subpremise-placeholder (input-address) for refined address form layouts. Dynamic Data Loading (lightning-tree): Improve the performance of large trees by loading data dynamically as tree nodes are expanded. Module Updates: lightning/analyticsWaveApi: New functions to manage CRM Analytics folders. lightning/platformUtilityBarApi (Beta): Control utility bar elements programmatically. lightning/platformWorkspaceApi: Enhanced compatibility and no longer requires Lightning Web Security pre-activation. experience/mobilePublisherConfigApi (Beta): New wire adapter to manage mobile publisher navigation. Aura Components lightning:InputAddress: Offers more flexible address input formats with new attributes (showCompactAddress, subpremise, subpremiseLabel, and subpremisePlaceholder). Based on these updates, we recommend developers review their custom Lightning Web Components (LWC) and Aura components to assess how they can leverage the accessibility changes and new attributes introduced in recent updates. For applications dealing with large tree structures, adopting the lightning-tree component with dynamic data loading capabilities can significantly enhance performance and user experience. Additionally, exploring the latest module updates for Lightning Web Components (LWC) offers opportunities to extend functionality and improve development efficiency by incorporating new features and enhancements into applications. 10. Streaming API Retirement If you are using Streaming API versions 23.0 through 36.0, this is an important update. These API versions are scheduled for retirement in the Winter ’25 release. These versions are now deprecated and will no longer receive official support. It’s essential to recognize the significance of this update for several reasons. Firstly, sticking with older versions means missing out on the latest enhancements and bug fixes, which could impact the performance and stability of your application. Secondly, as Salesforce continues to evolve, these legacy versions may encounter compatibility issues, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior or integration breakdowns. Therefore, action is required to ensure the continued efficiency and reliability of your Salesforce environment. If your applications are currently dependent on any of the retiring Streaming API versions, it’s imperative to promptly upgrade to a supported version. This urgency stems from three key factors: Newer API versions (37.0 and above) provide improved features, bug fixes, and overall reliability, contributing to enhanced stability and performance. Ensuring your integrations remain functional is crucial for long-term compatibility, safeguarding against disruptions as Salesforce progresses. By transitioning to Durable Streaming, introduced in version 37.0, you can capitalize on advanced event replay capabilities and enhanced fault tolerance, further fortifying your system’s resilience.

Sales Marketing,"5 Insights from the “State of Salesforce” 2023-24 Report By Ben McCarthy September 14, 2023 Branded content with IBM IBM’s “State of Salesforce” report is back, and perfectly timed to provide an extra layer of context for all the exciting Dreamforce news coming out this week. The report, which has been running since 2011, is the largest of its kind, providing valuable insights into the most successful Salesforce implementations. The State of Salesforce Since the release of the last 2022-23 IBM report, it’s been a bit of a whirlwind – and not the fun kind. Words such as downturn, inflation, layoffs, and recession have plagued our channels since the end of 2021, and Salesforce has been no exception to this. But there is a very bright light at the end of the tunnel, and that light is coming to us in the form of artificial intelligence. With the insane adoption of generative AI apps, and many industry thought leaders such as Bill Gates and Marc Benioff predicting that this new wave of technology will be unlike anything we have ever seen, could we be experiencing a new industrial revolution? Inside this year’s report, readers will find the results of the IBM research team speaking to 3,459 executives involved in Salesforce implementations. The report also contains a lot of data comparing the “pioneer” organizations, those who are embracing AI and change, versus the “pensive” who have yet to fully complete their digital transformation. Let’s dive into the current state of Salesforce for 2023-24, and some of the top trends that will affect all Salesforce professionals. Insight 1: Shape the Future of Generative AI Artificial intelligence: hype or the real thing? A natural question to ask when a new “game-changing” technology arrives on the scene. After all, some might still be reeling from the buzz around cryptocurrency and NFT’s. But artificial intelligence is different. Never in my 11 years in the Salesforce ecosystem have I seen Salesforce professionals, the wider tech ecosystem, and company executives get so excited over a technology. Let me share a few key findings from the report… 75% of CEOs believe competitive advantage will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI. 50% of CEOs are now integrating generative AI into products and services. 43% are using generative AI to inform their strategic decisions. Generative AI sales budgets are expected to triple by 2025, with marketing and service budgets expected to more than double. Most people hadn’t even heard of generative AI until less than a year ago, so I find these results pretty incredible. One big separation from the companies IBM identified as “pioneers” versus “pensives” in this space, is how they are approaching generative AI. Pioneers are already experimenting with AI, trying to find use cases that can increase profitability, and free up their employees to focus on higher value customer tasks. They are also expanding the potential remit of generative AI, that could be used across customer service, sales, and marketing. Pensive companies, alternatively, are cautiously focussed on internal use cases. Part of this cautiousness could be due to the “Trust Gap” that Salesforce has identified, which they have already set out to solve with the AI Cloud. READ MORE: IBM and Salesforce Team Up To Help Businesses Accelerate Adoption of Trustworthy AI If, after reading this insight, you feel that your company may be falling behind the curve when it comes to experimenting with AI, there are two major areas to focus on: Experiment: Whether this is upskilling yourself as a professional, or working alongside your business to get a headstart on potential projects, experimenting is the way to do it. Of course theory is important too, but with widely accessible generative AI platforms available, it’s time to get to grips with the potential. Think holistically: Don’t restrict yourself to improving the current state of operations, and think beyond simply helping your employees generate some text. We are still at the very early stages of AI, and anything is possible. Just in case any extra motivation is needed to get started, pioneers expect nearly 15% of their workforce will be augmented with generative AI tools within the next year as more employees are trained and gain hands-on experience. READ MORE: Generative AI: Meet Your Partner in Customer Service Insight 2: Gain Altitude With Industry Clouds It was around 2015 when I first heard of verticalization within Salesforce the company – that is, ensuring every touch point from sales teams, to product, and the implementation partner had an industry focus and specialization. This had a couple of main benefits. Firstly, the customer was surrounded by Salesforce experts that understood their industry, and spoke their language – acronyms and all. Secondly, it allowed the customer to get value out of their implementation faster. So it’s no real surprise to see IBM identify Industry Clouds as top trend for 2023-24. Why are they so impactful? Simple. Industry Clouds allow Salesforce customers to adopt specific, customer-centric solutions tailored for their industry. The reason this trend has been included, is due to the ROI and impact that pioneering organizations see when they implement Salesforce Industries. IBM has identified that pioneers see 150% more ROI than pensives. Pioneers are also more bullish on industry solutions in general, and are implementing customer experience with Industry Cloud capabilities 56% more than pensives. In addition, an encouraging statistic to come out of the report is that pioneering companies make up 14-24% of every industry, meaning that all organizations can take advantage of industry solutions. Source: IBM State of Salesforce 2023-24 report Insight 3: Integrate Data to Dismantle Siloes Remember when big data was the hot topic as organizations tried to work out how to deal with the immense amount of data they are generating? Well, we have come full circle. Data might not be the hot topic anymore, or be as interesting to talk about as artificial intelligence, but it is fundamental in everything we do as Salesforce professionals – especially in the age of AI. IBM’s third insight, in my opinion, is imperative to all businesses’ future success. In last year’s report, IBM identified Salesforce multi-cloud as an important trend, but in the 2023-24 report, we need to go beyond just multi-cloud, and ensure that all data from the organization is sitting in a centralized location. Of course, this means we have to do the basics right, such as ensuring an Account Manager has oversight of the customers implementation and any post-support that is going on. But by having centralized data, it also allows us to overlay AI to generate insights. The State of Salesforce report shows that pioneers are able to… Reveal new opportunities 39% more than pensives. Apply AI to generate insights 54% more. Identify 28% more unmet customer needs. Discover new business models 37% more. It’s also important to point out that data is the bedrock foundation of which generative AI efforts are laid. If data is sparse, inaccurate, or out of date, your generative AI outputs will be too. Insight 4: Invest in a Change-Ready Culture If there’s one thing that’s inevitable in the world of technology, it’s change. In the Salesforce ecosystem over the past 10 years, we’ve had to support lightning migrations, integrations of marketing automation systems, supporting a remote-first workforce, and now, we need to roll out artificial intelligence. If there’s a second thing we’ve learned in the world of technology, it’s that the companies that embrace chance and agility are those that reap the rewards, and the data backs this up. Pioneers prioritize higher accuracy in measuring Salesforce ROI so they can adopt more quickly (117% more than pensives) and they are also 89% more likely to adapt their business model. Pioneers are also 38% more likely than pensives to crowdsource innovation from within. This is especially important for artificial intelligence. Due to the fact that there are only a handful of well-known use cases for AI, it’s time to find out from your ‘boots on the ground’ how AI might be able to help them. But embracing change and implementing Salesforce isn’t enough, your organization needs to have proper change management in place to ensure that ideas and new technologies turn into cold hard ROI. Source: IBM State of Salesforce 2023-24 report Insight 5: Overcome Enterprise Inertia With Innovation Innovation is something all companies know they need to do, but in reality it can be a challenge. However, as this insight in the report suggests, it’s a sure fire way to overcome a stagnant organization. Innovation is also the perfect word to summarize all the insights in this year’s report. Any one of these trends will support your organization in becoming ready for changes to the market. And how do you understand changes in the market, or within your business? The answer is data. Data might as well be the closest thing we have to a crystal ball. Our ability to move in any one of a multitude of directions, with the ability to shift in another quickly as circumstances change, all hinges on our ability to see into the future. The pioneers in this year’s report are generating an average of 40% more revenue per license – from $2.6M for pensives, to $3.6M for pioneers. This generates a virtuous cycle, they continue to generate strong results that help fund further technology investments, and greater future returns. Summary This year’s State of Salesforce report provides valuable insights into how the top performing companies on the planet are already implementing change in the next wave of technology. There is no doubt that the next few years are going to be extremely exciting for organizations who adopt generative AI, and of course, for those Salesforce professionals who will be implementing it. One of my favorite parts about this report is that it focuses on the vital and also secondary areas that we will all need to take into consideration when embarking on this new journey. Whilst AI is our favorite new toy at the moment, let’s not forget about data, change management, and adoption as core pillars of any Salesforce implementation.",Salesforce

Sales Marketing,"15 Best Practices in Salesforce that Your Organization Should Follow Calendar March 1, 2024 Tag Salesforce Home / Blog / Salesforce / 15 Best Practices in Salesforce that Your Organization Should Follow During Salesforce implementation, adhering to these practices is crucial for long-term success. From managing clean data to designating a product owner, each step plays a crucial role in user experience. Staying informed about Salesforce platform updates and continually adapting business processes are key aspects to maximize their impact. Additionally, being prepared to report issues and find effective solutions is essential for maintaining system integrity and performance. Whether you are new to Salesforce or a seasoned professional, here are some best practices you should be aware of. 1- Understand Internal Processes Successful Salesforce implementation requires a deep understanding of internal processes and a well-defined business logic. Before making extensive customizations, it is advisable to clearly prioritize fundamental business needs over superfluous desires, starting with standard Salesforce functions to address immediate needs. This progressive approach avoids unnecessary complexity and facilitates long-term issue resolution. Additionally, it is crucial to capture detailed requirements by mapping existing workflows and business processes before introducing new features. Technology is utilized most effectively only when processes are fully understood, allowing significant improvements in user experience. Using reason, prioritizing business logic over desires, becomes a key principle for a successful and adaptable implementation as business needs evolve. 2- Keep the Focus on the End User Salesforce’s fundamental premise is to simplify the lives of end users. To achieve this, it is essential to involve them from the beginning, even before implementation. This active participation creates a sense of ownership among users and facilitates the identification and addressing of potential weaknesses in their experiences. Otherwise, there is a risk of users abandoning the platform, either due to confusion or feelings of neglect. In this regard, it is crucial to keep users informed about changes and updates as well as seeking their input at various stages while prioritizing their needs. This approach ensures the design of a platform that not only adapts to business requirements, but also generates optimal results by actively considering user feedback. Additionally, don’t forget to optimize Salesforce for mobile devices as a key element to enhance team efficiency by utilizing Salesforce Mobile and responsive designs in platform customization. This consideration of mobile usability and adapting the interface to various screen sizes not only improves productivity, but also allows accessibility to Salesforce information from any location. 3- Appoint a Product Owner Many organizations have established effective Salesforce management through a designated product owner, also referred to as an administrator or project manager. This individual, whether an internal employee or an external administrator, serves as the point of contact for questions, issues, and update requests. The product owner becomes an invaluable resource for your team, providing direct assistance and facilitating efficient communication regarding Salesforce usage. It’s worth noting that new Salesforce users can turn to managed service teams to get started before hiring someone internally. 4- Select the Ideal Salesforce Consulting Partner Having a partner for configuration, development, implementation, and support throughout your Salesforce journey is invaluable. Certified experts can advise on the initial setup, using best practices to support ongoing success. They assist in making informed decisions on customizations, focusing on essential functions, and maintaining system usability. Additionally, your partner will be available for continuous support and training, handling improvements, user issues, errors, and new requirements as they arise. Their consistent experience and assistance are key elements to maximize the effectiveness and adaptability of your use of Salesforce. What is a Salesforce Consulting Partner and How Can It Help You? A Salesforce Consulting Partner can help you to fully implement the platform by taking care of the details so that you can focus on the development and growth of your business. LEARN MORE ➜ 5- Prioritize Data Quality Maintaining data quality is essential for Salesforce efficiency. Neglecting this aspect can lead to incorrect, duplicate, or missing data, resulting in erroneous decision-making. It is recommended to establish effective data hygiene processes, including naming conventions and data selection lists to standardize information. Training users on the importance of maintaining accurate and complete data significantly contributes to this process. Valuable tools such as duplicate record checks, data cleansing, and quality metrics can help ensure data integrity. While Salesforce may be the sole source of information for your company, without proper data, you won’t be able to fully leverage its potential. 6- Update and Customize Updating and customizing in Salesforce are essential practices to optimize system performance and assure alignment with changing business requirements. However, it’s crucial to strike a balance, avoiding excessive customization and code that could lead to technical debt for future maintenance and scalability. The recommendation is to opt for out-of-the-box solutions whenever possible, simplifying processes for users and administrators, and facilitating data search and entry. Moving from simplicity to complexity requires choosing the right resources. Staying informed about Salesforce updates and carefully planning customizations require knowledgeable and skilled resources which are essential to knowing when and what updates will be implemented. To overcome these challenges, having online resources and Salesforce partners that provide guidance when needed becomes a key strategy to maximize the value of Salesforce and ensure its smooth long-term operation. 7- Develop Integration Strategies Developing a robust integration strategy is crucial to effectively connect Salesforce with other systems in your technological environment. Use APIs and middleware tools to ensure a seamless flow of data between platforms. Interoperability between Salesforce and other business applications enhances information consistency and accessibility. A well-thought-out strategy facilitates real-time data synchronization and avoids redundancies, enabling efficient information flow between systems and thus optimizes data-driven decision-making. 8- Use Automations and AI The key to optimizing processes in Salesforce is the strategic use of automation tools such as workflows and triggers. This practice not only improves overall efficiency and reduces errors in data, but also frees up time and resources for the team by automating repetitive tasks. It’s essential to identify and plan appropriate tasks for automation to avoid negative impacts on system performance. With tools like Flow Builder, Salesforce provides a robust platform to effectively implement automation, significantly improving organizational operability. With the explosion of AI in CRM, automations have grown exponentially! 9- Establish a Robust Governance Model Implementing a strong governance model is crucial for efficient Salesforce administration. This model includes change management, usage monitoring, and compliance assurance. Establishing a version control process ensures supervised implementation of updates and changes which can reduce the risk of errors and conflicts. Additionally, maintaining detailed documentation for configurations and customizations allows a clear understanding of the system structure and facilitates future updates. Governance in Salesforce is key to maintaining stability and consistency in the working environment, promoting efficiency, and ensuring security. 10- Perform Continuous Monitoring and Audits Continuous performance monitoring in Salesforce is crucial for providing an optimal user experience and efficient system operation. Tools like Salesforce Health Check and Analytics facilitate the identification and resolution of potential bottlenecks, allowing proactive adjustments that improve speed and efficiency. This preventive approach not only ensures smooth operation, but also prevents unplanned interruptions, maintaining a Salesforce environment that adapts to evolving business needs. In addition, conducting random audits allows identifying areas for improvement, optimizing customizations, and removing unused elements which ensures that Salesforce evolves in line with long-term business requirements. Continuous optimization not only improves system performance, but also contributes to business dynamics. 11- Facilitate Collaboration and Communication Fostering collaboration among users is vital to maximize the utility of Salesforce. Utilize tools like Salesforce Chatter or Slack, among others, that are integrated with Salesforce to facilitate communication. This creates an environment where users can efficiently share ideas, updates, and best practices. Stimulating information exchange within the platform not only strengthens collaboration, but also enhances operational efficiency and data-driven decision-making. 12- Use Sandboxes Before launching any new functionality or significant changes in the production environment, thorough testing in a sandbox is necessary. This allows identifying and correcting potential issues before affecting real-time operation, thus avoiding unpleasant surprises and ensuring that adjustments proceed as expected. Regular testing of existing functionalities is also important to maintain their operability and proper use by the team. On the other hand, comprehensive user training is essential for developing their competence in using Salesforce. A well-trained team maximizes the platform’s capabilities and contributes to optimizing its performance. Investing in user training is a key decision to ensure long-term success. 13- Document Everything After implementing functionalities in Salesforce, it is crucial to maintain the logic supporting decisions and system usage. Develop comprehensive documentation for administrators and end-users, detailing methods, key elements, and specific functions. In addition to serving as a study guide for the team, updated documentation complements testing, which ensures coherence and efficiency. 14- Ensure Data Security Data security is paramount. Implement measures to establish an effective system for protecting your organization’s sensitive data. For example, use secure passwords, multi-factor authentication, regular backups, IP address filtering, etc. Other measures, such as combining profiles, permission sets, and field-level security, guarantees that each user has access only to the information necessary to fulfill their roles and responsibilities. This strengthens the integrity and confidentiality of data in Salesforce. 15- Establish a Change Management Strategy Change management in Salesforce is essential for the growth and scalability of your solution. This practice allows the introduction of new features in a prioritized and planned manner, avoiding potential negative impacts on users or overall business operations. It involves selecting a dedicated team, developing strategies for change requests, active involvement of stakeholders, consideration of the impact on users and processes, and the design of training and communication plans. Adopting this practice is crucial to ensure a smooth transition, optimized performance, all while minimizing risks associated with significant changes in Salesforce. By following these practices, your organization will maximize the advantages of Salesforce and improve productivity, data accuracy, and user satisfaction.

However, Salesforce is still moving towards a Permission Set security model, and now is a great time to get ahead of the curve and start planning your migration. “Hey, #AwesomeAdmins, I wanted to update you on the End of Life of Permission on Profiles. We are no longer going to enforce the Spring ‘26 end-of-life date. However, I still wholeheartedly recommend you operate with a permission set-led security model. All of our investments are very mission set and permission set group focused from a permissions standpoint. In the coming weeks, you will see some updated blog posts from me on the @SalesforceAdmns blog.” Cheryl Feldman, Salesforce Salesforce has introduced numerous new features over the past few releases to help you view and analyze your profiles. When moving from Profiles to Permissions Sets there are plenty of pitfalls to avoid! Check out the article below for 5 important things to avoid. READ MORE: Moving from Profiles to Permission Sets: 5 Pitfalls to Avoid | Salesforce Ben Still a bit new to Permission Sets? Not to worry. Andreea has put together lots of tips for you to get you started successfully. And while we’re at it, you should also swot up on Permission Set Groups which allow you to group Permission Sets. 2. Dashboards Engage your users and key stakeholders by upgrading your dashboards to incorporate the latest features and enhancements. You and your users can now create visually stunning and engaging dashboards with images, rich text, and dashboard widgets that are bound to impress your users and key stakeholders. Increased user adoption and engagement! To get started, click “+ Widget” and select the type of widget to add when editing a dashboard. READ MORE: Embed Image Widgets in Salesforce Dashboards You can also add up to five filters (instead of three) from the Spring ‘24. Save valuable admin time by transferring dashboard ownership. Historically, when the owner of an important dashboard left the company, you had the hassle of cloning and recreating the dashboard. From Winter ‘24, you can transfer ownership of a dashboard and the new owner has complete control of the dashboard. If a user with multiple dashboards leaves the company, you can also transfer dashboards in bulk! Don’t forget that dashboards are not just for the Dashboard tab – dashboards can be embedded in other places, such as the Home page, to give users the metrics they need as soon as they log in to Salesforce. 3. Dynamic Forms, Dynamic Actions & Dynamic Related Lists I’m starting to sound like a broken record – I’ve been advocating for Salesforce’s dynamic product suite for years now! The absence of support for standard objects and mobile may have prevented you from exploring these features but I have good news for you! As promised at Dreamforce ‘22, Salesforce has extended Dynamic Forms to support hundreds of standard objects! Specifically, support has been extended to the majority of LWC-enabled standard objects (Lighting Web Component enabled). In addition, Dynamic Forms is generally available for mobile as of the Winter ‘24 release. With Dynamic Forms now readily available on most standard objects and mobile, 2024 could be a good time to assess your existing page needs and have fun re-designing and re-building with Dynamic Forms, Actions, and Lists. Still unsure if these features are for you? Here are a couple of use cases to spark some inspiration. Dynamic Forms Remove the need for multiple page layouts by using a single Dynamic Form and making Fields or Field Components visible to specific users. For example, you could create a Dynamic Form for Cases and display different information to your Support Team and Sales Team. You can also make Fields and Field Components conditionally visible based on Record Type or a field’s value. A classic example might be to make the Closed Lost Reason field visible only when an Opportunity record is Closed Lost. Or perhaps the Contract Renewal Date field should only appear once an Opportunity is Closed Won. The possibilities are practically limitless… Dynamic Actions Do you have any actions that are only applicable to part of a process or a particular group of users? Dynamic Actions can be configured to display based on filters you determine. You could choose to only allow managers to view a “Send Contract” action or hide a “Send Follow-Up Email” action when a Case is closed. Dynamic Related Lists Use Dynamic Related Lists to create related lists that are filtered to specific records. For example, Closed Won Opportunities, Open Opportunities, and Open Cases. Name your Dynamic Related Lists to ensure it is clear to your users what records are being presented. In addition, you can configure what fields are displayed and in what order, choose the number of records to display, and also select which actions are available. Get started now with the following guides: Salesforce Dynamic Forms: Overview & Deep Dive Tutorial Salesforce Dynamic Actions – Overview & Deep Dive Tutorial Ultimate Guide to Salesforce Dynamic Related Lists 4. Einstein AI Tools Stuck on where to start? For now, let me give you some idea of the features available to you and what’s coming soon. Einstein Search: Provides users with personalized and predictive search results within the Salesforce platform. Einstein Search uses machine learning algorithms to understand user behavior, preferences, and context to deliver more relevant search results. This helps users find the information they need faster and more efficiently. Einstein Lead Scoring: Utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze and predict the likelihood of a lead converting into a sales opportunity or becoming a customer. Einstein Opportunity Scoring: Utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze and predict the likelihood of success for sales opportunities. Einstein Forecasting: Uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to bring more certainty and visibility to your forecasts. Einstein Activity Capture: Allows users to automatically capture and log emails, meetings, and other activities related to customer interactions directly within Salesforce. Einstein Case Classification: Automatically categorize and classify support cases submitted by customers. Recommended Articles in Flow: Provides personalized self-service support to customers by recommending relevant knowledge articles during their interactions with a Flow. There are plenty more AI features currently available. Check out Lucy’s article on the 50+ Einstein AI products and tools. READ MORE: A Guide to 50+ Salesforce Einstein AI Products and Tools Coming Soon Einstein for Formulas Anticipated to be released at the end of February, after the Spring ‘24 release, Einstein for Flow will act as your assistant and explain formulas in formula fields, validation rules, and default values in fields. The assistant will be available when you create a new formula or when you modify an existing one. Source: Salesforce Einstein for Flow Currently in pilot with a group of customers, Einstein for Flow is expected to go GA in Spring ‘24. As an Admin, you’ll describe the Flow you need in natural language. Einstein for Flow will then generate the Flow for you. Source: Salesforce Copilot As a personal assistant, Einstein Copilot will sit in the CRM app and respond instinctively to any user queries. Powered by Prompt Builder, you can create and manage natural language prompts that can be used to interact with Einstein Copilot in the front end. Accessing this tool means all the information being delivered is reliable and accurate, as it is technically being engineered by the admin. In addition, you can test out how your prompt works in the playground environment, allowing you a space to trial and error your responses! Prompt Builder Salesforce Prompt Builder is a new feature in Salesforce that was also announced in the Spring ‘24 release, that lets you create prompts to generate personalized content. These prompts are like short questions you ask Salesforce to make content for you, such as personalized emails, social media posts, or website pages. Instead of giving users a blank slate like ChatGPT, it uses templates for specific situations, like “Write an introduction email to this customer” or “Write a follow-up email to this case”. It’s a powerful tool for enhancing customer engagement and sales, but it’s important to use it ethically and ensure the generated content is accurate and non-discriminatory. READ MORE: Einstein Copilot & Prompt Builder to be Released in February | Salesforce Ben I expect we’ll see further AI announcements for Admin at TDX, so be sure to check out our coverage of the event to stay up to date on the latest news! 5. Intelligence View & Seller Home As businesses strive to keep up with customer expectations and stay ahead of their competitors, an engaging and efficient Salesforce interface for sales users becomes increasingly important. Several new features have been rolled out for sales teams over the past few releases, including Intelligence View and Seller Home. Both features are designed to offer users an easy way to access information and identify tasks to be done and records that need attention. Intelligence View Intelligence View for leads, contacts, and accounts is a great way for users to simply and easily identify prospects and customers that need attention. This will save them time, with less need to wade through every record and they can also take action directly from the Lead, Contact, or Account tab. Fewer clicks = happy users. Seller Home Seller Home is designed to drive success for your sales team by giving them a complete view of their business. Sales users can get a ton of useful information at a glance including: Opportunity overview Account overview Lead overview Contact overview Weekly or monthly goals Today’s Events To-do items Recent Records Contact suggestions – identified by Einstein from a user’s emails and events This new dashboard-like home page is the default Home page for the Sales, Sales Console, and Sales Engagement apps. It will appear automatically unless you have customized those pages, in this instance, you can manually enable it from Setup. Summary With every release, Salesforce gives us new features and enhancements to explore. As Admins, we should proactively keep up to date with all of these exciting changes to ensure we are following best practices and utilizing Salesforce to get the greatest return on investment.

As you’d expect from a top CRM service, both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience allow you to edit sharing settings using Salesforce’s user role hierarchy. Users higher up in the hierarchy can view, edit, and report on the data owned or shared with them by users below them in the hierarchy. Simply: In the Quick Find box, type in ‘Roles’ and select Roles If the Understanding Roles page comes up, click Set Up Roles Add a label for the Role. The Role Name field will auto-populate.

Marketing automation software can increase qualified leads by 451%, and Salesforce shines when it comes to lead management. You can view your lead metrics and update your records from Lead Intelligence View. Metrics include things like: Total leads Leads with no activity in the past 30 days Overdue leads Engaged and contacted leads Disqualified leads To view more on each individual record, just click on the side panel icon next to the record’s name or click the lead name to see more information. Here’s how you’d edit lead details: Click edit Select the fields you want to update Make and save the changes To share leads in Professional, Unlimited, Enterprise, Performance, and Developer Edition organizations with other users, roles, or groups, click on Sharing. Now, to convert qualified leads, here’s what you’d do: In a lead record, choose the lead you wish to convert Type a name for the account you’re creating If you’re using Salesforce Classic and want to update a personal account, overwrite the lead source with the value from the lead Choose a contact If you’re using Lightning Experience, choose an existing opportunity from the list. If not, enter a name for the one you wish to create Convert your lead Create a follow-up task if you wish (e.g. how you’d like to nurture the lead going forward) Using Salesforce Reports and Dashboards A recent survey highlighted how 47% of data engineers estimated that poor data quality negatively impacts a quarter or more of a company’s revenue. With Salesforce, you can help stay on top of your data with visual dashboards and custom reports. Users with any role can view and whip up new reports from their accounts. Salesforce Report Builder is a visual drag-and-drop tool that you can use to create your own reports or edit ones already in your database.

Sales Marketing,"5 Insights from the “State of Salesforce” 2023-24 Report By Ben McCarthy September 14, 2023 Branded content with IBM IBM’s “State of Salesforce” report is back, and perfectly timed to provide an extra layer of context for all the exciting Dreamforce news coming out this week. The report, which has been running since 2011, is the largest of its kind, providing valuable insights into the most successful Salesforce implementations. The State of Salesforce Since the release of the last 2022-23 IBM report, it’s been a bit of a whirlwind – and not the fun kind. Words such as downturn, inflation, layoffs, and recession have plagued our channels since the end of 2021, and Salesforce has been no exception to this. But there is a very bright light at the end of the tunnel, and that light is coming to us in the form of artificial intelligence. With the insane adoption of generative AI apps, and many industry thought leaders such as Bill Gates and Marc Benioff predicting that this new wave of technology will be unlike anything we have ever seen, could we be experiencing a new industrial revolution? Inside this year’s report, readers will find the results of the IBM research team speaking to 3,459 executives involved in Salesforce implementations. The report also contains a lot of data comparing the “pioneer” organizations, those who are embracing AI and change, versus the “pensive” who have yet to fully complete their digital transformation. Let’s dive into the current state of Salesforce for 2023-24, and some of the top trends that will affect all Salesforce professionals. Insight 1: Shape the Future of Generative AI Artificial intelligence: hype or the real thing? A natural question to ask when a new “game-changing” technology arrives on the scene. After all, some might still be reeling from the buzz around cryptocurrency and NFT’s. But artificial intelligence is different. Never in my 11 years in the Salesforce ecosystem have I seen Salesforce professionals, the wider tech ecosystem, and company executives get so excited over a technology. Let me share a few key findings from the report… 75% of CEOs believe competitive advantage will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI. 50% of CEOs are now integrating generative AI into products and services. 43% are using generative AI to inform their strategic decisions. Generative AI sales budgets are expected to triple by 2025, with marketing and service budgets expected to more than double. Most people hadn’t even heard of generative AI until less than a year ago, so I find these results pretty incredible. One big separation from the companies IBM identified as “pioneers” versus “pensives” in this space, is how they are approaching generative AI. Pioneers are already experimenting with AI, trying to find use cases that can increase profitability, and free up their employees to focus on higher value customer tasks. They are also expanding the potential remit of generative AI, that could be used across customer service, sales, and marketing. Pensive companies, alternatively, are cautiously focussed on internal use cases. Part of this cautiousness could be due to the “Trust Gap” that Salesforce has identified, which they have already set out to solve with the AI Cloud. READ MORE: IBM and Salesforce Team Up To Help Businesses Accelerate Adoption of Trustworthy AI If, after reading this insight, you feel that your company may be falling behind the curve when it comes to experimenting with AI, there are two major areas to focus on: Experiment: Whether this is upskilling yourself as a professional, or working alongside your business to get a headstart on potential projects, experimenting is the way to do it. Of course theory is important too, but with widely accessible generative AI platforms available, it’s time to get to grips with the potential. Think holistically: Don’t restrict yourself to improving the current state of operations, and think beyond simply helping your employees generate some text. We are still at the very early stages of AI, and anything is possible. Just in case any extra motivation is needed to get started, pioneers expect nearly 15% of their workforce will be augmented with generative AI tools within the next year as more employees are trained and gain hands-on experience. READ MORE: Generative AI: Meet Your Partner in Customer Service Insight 2: Gain Altitude With Industry Clouds It was around 2015 when I first heard of verticalization within Salesforce the company – that is, ensuring every touch point from sales teams, to product, and the implementation partner had an industry focus and specialization. This had a couple of main benefits. Firstly, the customer was surrounded by Salesforce experts that understood their industry, and spoke their language – acronyms and all. Secondly, it allowed the customer to get value out of their implementation faster. So it’s no real surprise to see IBM identify Industry Clouds as top trend for 2023-24. Why are they so impactful? Simple. Industry Clouds allow Salesforce customers to adopt specific, customer-centric solutions tailored for their industry. The reason this trend has been included, is due to the ROI and impact that pioneering organizations see when they implement Salesforce Industries. IBM has identified that pioneers see 150% more ROI than pensives. Pioneers are also more bullish on industry solutions in general, and are implementing customer experience with Industry Cloud capabilities 56% more than pensives. In addition, an encouraging statistic to come out of the report is that pioneering companies make up 14-24% of every industry, meaning that all organizations can take advantage of industry solutions. Source: IBM State of Salesforce 2023-24 report Insight 3: Integrate Data to Dismantle Siloes Remember when big data was the hot topic as organizations tried to work out how to deal with the immense amount of data they are generating? Well, we have come full circle. Data might not be the hot topic anymore, or be as interesting to talk about as artificial intelligence, but it is fundamental in everything we do as Salesforce professionals – especially in the age of AI. IBM’s third insight, in my opinion, is imperative to all businesses’ future success. In last year’s report, IBM identified Salesforce multi-cloud as an important trend, but in the 2023-24 report, we need to go beyond just multi-cloud, and ensure that all data from the organization is sitting in a centralized location. Of course, this means we have to do the basics right, such as ensuring an Account Manager has oversight of the customers implementation and any post-support that is going on. But by having centralized data, it also allows us to overlay AI to generate insights. The State of Salesforce report shows that pioneers are able to… Reveal new opportunities 39% more than pensives. Apply AI to generate insights 54% more. Identify 28% more unmet customer needs. Discover new business models 37% more. It’s also important to point out that data is the bedrock foundation of which generative AI efforts are laid. If data is sparse, inaccurate, or out of date, your generative AI outputs will be too. Insight 4: Invest in a Change-Ready Culture If there’s one thing that’s inevitable in the world of technology, it’s change. In the Salesforce ecosystem over the past 10 years, we’ve had to support lightning migrations, integrations of marketing automation systems, supporting a remote-first workforce, and now, we need to roll out artificial intelligence. If there’s a second thing we’ve learned in the world of technology, it’s that the companies that embrace chance and agility are those that reap the rewards, and the data backs this up. Pioneers prioritize higher accuracy in measuring Salesforce ROI so they can adopt more quickly (117% more than pensives) and they are also 89% more likely to adapt their business model. Pioneers are also 38% more likely than pensives to crowdsource innovation from within. This is especially important for artificial intelligence. Due to the fact that there are only a handful of well-known use cases for AI, it’s time to find out from your ‘boots on the ground’ how AI might be able to help them. But embracing change and implementing Salesforce isn’t enough, your organization needs to have proper change management in place to ensure that ideas and new technologies turn into cold hard ROI. Source: IBM State of Salesforce 2023-24 report Insight 5: Overcome Enterprise Inertia With Innovation Innovation is something all companies know they need to do, but in reality it can be a challenge. However, as this insight in the report suggests, it’s a sure fire way to overcome a stagnant organization. Innovation is also the perfect word to summarize all the insights in this year’s report. Any one of these trends will support your organization in becoming ready for changes to the market. And how do you understand changes in the market, or within your business? The answer is data. Data might as well be the closest thing we have to a crystal ball. Our ability to move in any one of a multitude of directions, with the ability to shift in another quickly as circumstances change, all hinges on our ability to see into the future. The pioneers in this year’s report are generating an average of 40% more revenue per license – from $2.6M for pensives, to $3.6M for pioneers. This generates a virtuous cycle, they continue to generate strong results that help fund further technology investments, and greater future returns. Summary This year’s State of Salesforce report provides valuable insights into how the top performing companies on the planet are already implementing change in the next wave of technology. There is no doubt that the next few years are going to be extremely exciting for organizations who adopt generative AI, and of course, for those Salesforce professionals who will be implementing it. One of my favorite parts about this report is that it focuses on the vital and also secondary areas that we will all need to take into consideration when embarking on this new journey. Whilst AI is our favorite new toy at the moment, let’s not forget about data, change management, and adoption as core pillars of any Salesforce implementation.",Salesforce

How Must Does It Cost to Implement Salesforce? True Insight How to Use Salesforce for Sales: Sales Cloud Best Practices Sales Cloud is a Salesforce CRM module designed to streamline lead generation for sales teams. The fundamental items of Salesforce organization are Objects. Salespeople often use four standard Objects: Leads, Contacts, Accounts, and Opportunities. And here’s how the whole Objects hierarchy works. Leads A Lead in the Sales Cloud is a prospective customer who has shown interest in buying a company’s product. Salesforce Sales Cloud assists in locating leads and works to turn them into clients. Contacts If a sales representative qualifies a Lead, they become a Contact. Contacts contain information about key businesspeople involved in a deal. Accounts Usually, a Lead isn’t the only person that has initiated the deal, and there may be other individuals associated with the company. And Accounts unify all the Contracts to keep information about these individuals and companies. Further, salespeople can customize and categorize Accounts by the “Type” field in Salesforce based on the needs of the sales: Prospect Accounts, Customer Accounts, or Partner Accounts. Accounts can also represent Opportunities. Opportunities Opportunities are deals in progress. And Opportunities remain Opportunities until they are Closed/Won or Closed/Lost. Salesforce Sales Cloud vs Service Cloud: Key Similarities and Differences How to Activate Leads, Contacts, Accounts, and Campaigns in Salesforce Sales Cloud To enable all the above, follow these steps: Step 1: Log in to your Salesforce account. Step 2: Go to products and choose Sales from the drop-down menu. You are prompted to a new window. Step 3: Choose the Campaign or Lead or Account, or Contact menu depending on what you want to perform. Step 4: Now click on the new button. A window pops up. Step 5: Fill out the details and click on the Save button to save the changes made. How to Implement Salesforce as a Pro: Steps, Methodologies, and Detailed Plan What is a Sales Process in Salesforce? The Salesforce sales process is a sequence of activities from product and market research to the sales close that a sales representative must complete using CRM tools.

With this pipeline, salespeople can manage and track the complex activities essential to closing deals. How to Enhance Salesforce Sales Cloud with Mailchimp Integration How to Create a Sales Process in Salesforce Salesforce Sales Cloud enables building a perfect sales process powered by top-notch CRM technology. But before you apply it, you need to draft and negotiate with your team. Here are the effective sales process steps sales representatives usually follow: Become an expert in the products you are selling to successfully market their functionality, spot potential pitfalls, shorten the sales cycle and manage objections effectively. Identify your buyer persona: their demographics, needs, wants, behaviors, and communication priorities. Set up prospecting and lead generation. Qualify prospects to make sure that your product is a good match for them. Analyze and understand the needs of your customers. Take time to prepare for the sales call and be ready for objections. Present your product as a solution to the prospect’s issues, not just highlight product features on a sales call. Follow up with the prospect and send a proposal, reiterate the following steps, and negotiate the deal. Nurture the relationship with your customers, cross-sell, and upsell. Once you agree upon the key elements of a sales process, you need to set up key sales stages in Salesforce for Leads and Opportunities. Lead Stages vs Opportunity Stages in Salesforce | Ascendix Lead Stages vs Opportunity Stages in Salesforce The most common Lead stages look like these: Open: The Lead has been created, but a salesperson has yet to communicate with them. Nurture: The Lead has shown interest in the product/service but is not yet ready to purchase. They require further nurturing. MQL: This means Marketing Qualified Lead, a prospect who has subscribed to mailing (usually via website) and demonstrates a high level of interest. Contacted: A sales representative has reached out to the Lead to initiate the qualification process. Qualified: A sales rep is in the process of the Lead qualification. Converted: The Lead has been turned into a Contact within an Account. After conversion, it becomes and remains an Opportunity until the deal is either Closed/Won or Closed/Lost. The Opportunity Stages look a bit different: Awareness: The Contact knows about your product or service. Interest: A sales representative has interacted with the Contact and sent them educational content like eBooks or whitepapers. Consideration: The Contact is comparing you against other product or service providers. Decision: The Contact is narrowing down their choices. Quote/Negotiation: The Account decision-makers have received a personalized proposal; discussion may occur. Closed/Won: The salesperson has succeeded in closing the sale. Closed/Lost: The Account chose not to use your company’s service or product. How to Set Lead Stages in Salesforce These are the steps that will help you create your Lead Stages in Salesforce: Click the Gear icon. Click “Edit Object.” Click “Fields and Relationships.” Click “Lead Status” in the search box. Search for the Lead Status Picklist and click “New’.

Click “Reorder.” Drag and drop your stage names and modify them accordingly. After you set up sales stages in Salesforce, you need to constantly monitor historical trends to review and improve your pipeline processes. How to Build a Guided Sales Path in Salesforce A guided sales path can support and improve your sales process. You can design your strategy based on the signs and activities most likely to indicate closed deals. Once you build a process, you can recreate it in the CRM by following these steps: Move to the required Object. Create a New Record Type within the Object for which you would like to create a Path. Navigate to Setup and Enable the Path. Type “Path” into the search box and select Path Settings. Click “Enable.” Select “Remember User’s Path Preferences” to ensure that the Path remembers its previous state. Select New Path. Create the Path and assign it a unique name. Select the Object that the Path will be used on. Select the Record Type you created and choose the Picklist from the Record Type. Click “Next.” Choose up to five critical fields for each stage. Click “Next.” Activate the Path. Such a sales path can simplify the onboarding of a new sales representative. Need Help with Salesforce?

Sales Marketing,"How Do I Get My Sales Reps To Use a CRM? Sales rep looking at several dashboards: sales reps use CRM The CRM is the beating heart of any sales organization, which is why adoption is critical [Adobe Stock] Our sales ops pros weigh in on the best tactics for boosting CRM adoption — without a lot of rep nagging. Jen Gustavson February 3, 2023 4 min read Share article Salesblazers from our online community wanted to know how to get sales reps invested in new workflows and tools. And more specifically: “How do we get them to use the customer relationship management (CRM) software?” Fields get unfilled. Data is not up to date. All of this lowers the return on investment on a tool we’re using the valuable budget for! Ashley Mattis, senior director of sales operations and strategy at Groupon, shares her take on this common problem and the broader issue of change management. Join the Salesblazer movement Together, we’re building the largest and most successful community of sales professionals. Get deals done, make customers successful, and help your company grow. Get started Why do you need buy-in from sales reps? You could have the most beautifully baked-out processes and tools in your customer relationship management platform (CRM), but if reps aren’t using them, you’ve invested in something with zero return. Building trust is crucial, especially at the beginning, because no rollout of any new tool or process is ever perfect. You’ll hit snags or unanticipated bugs. These early challenges require lots and lots of patience from your team while they get resolved. If your teams aren’t bought in on the bigger picture, they’ll have zero tolerance for when things inevitably go wrong – big or small. You’ll miss whatever goal you were originally working toward. And the sales operations team would have spent weeks and months rolling out a new process for a CRM that’s ultimately rejected. Buy-in helps you avoid all of that tension and makes sure reps adopt new processes as you introduce new tools into their workflow. You have to start at the top to be effective at the bottom, and nothing beats finding the right person to deliver a message. Ashley Mattis Sr. Director of Sales Operations and Strategy Groupon How do you get sales reps to use new tools and processes, like a CRM? Recruit a pit crew. They’re a mix of sales reps from across different levels and verticals, a representation of people with more tenure and those who are quick to adopt technology. This group should be the first to know about upcoming changes and act as your litmus test. Then recruit people outside of sales operations to lead the pit crew. Bring in product management, engineering, and sales leaders to explain the data behind the decision. This opens you up to feedback early on in the process, which is extremely helpful when choosing between vendors. At Groupon, I used this process to successfully implement everything from contact cadence software to an upgraded user interface (UI). And when you’re ready to roll out the new process or tool widely? Make sure it comes from the top. Sales ops has little credibility with sales reps because they don’t always understand the scope of your responsibilities. While sales leaders may trust you, the average rep probably won’t. They look to their sales leaders for guidance. Consider bringing in a sales leader to do the initial overview, so that it’s coming from someone to whom reps are accountable. Then, when it’s time for the nuts and bolts, swoop in with data, demos, and visualizations. You have to start at the top to be effective at the bottom. Nothing beats finding the right person to deliver the right message. When I first started in this field, there was often a feeling of sales operations versus sales – even though at the end of the day we all had the same goals. Ashley Mattis Sr. Director of Sales Operations and Strategy Groupon How do we ensure adoption is successful? Once you have buy-in, focus on developing training. I structure my sessions similar to a college course. We start off at the 100 level, a light introduction that gives them enough knowledge to complete what they need to do. Then we build up to the 200 and 300 level, sharing more detailed content and training materials to support each stage. Also, don’t underestimate the benefit of a reward system! You’d be surprised how much participation will rise when you offer something as simple as a certification process. If I give certification saying a rep has mastered a new prospecting cadence, for example, reps feel empowered to engage with the tool more and even train others. Lastly, don’t forget about the human element of change management. When I first started in this field, there was often a feeling of sales operations versus sales. The sales ops team would try to get the reps to do something, and reps would resist, even though at the end of the day we all had the same goals. To avoid this adversarial dynamic, pull the empathy lever. Spend time getting to know your reps, find out what their pain points are. I instituted a shadowing program with my sales operations team for this very purpose. Change can be daunting, and many of our businesses had to change over and over again in the past year. With communication, empathy, and data, you can keep your reps invested in adoption and your sales organization functioning as one machine. How are sales ops teams driving efficiency today?

Sales Marketing,"The Pros and Cons of Salesforce for Outside Sales Reps May 16, 2022 pros and cons of Salesforce for Outside Sales Reps A good sales leader knows how important an effective CRM system is for their sales team. Finding the right CRM tool for your outside sales team’s needs and fully taking advantage of its capabilities can significantly help improve your sales process, streamline activities, and increase revenue. With so many options in sales CRMs available today, it is important to really take a look at both the good and bad of the different tools to help pinpoint a good fit for your team. One popular tool you may be considering is the Salesforce CRM. In this article, we evaluate the strength of Salesforce for outside sales teams by breaking down the pros and cons of this CRM option. Pros of Salesforce: Top Option in Sales CRM Platforms Salesforce is the most well-known and widely-used sales CRM in the market, trusted by over 150,000 customers worldwide. salesforce for outside sales top crm Salesforce.com is the top CRM by market share. Source: Apps Run the World Easy-Access Central Location for All Customer Data Like all CRMs, one of Salesforce’s value-adds is serving as your company’s single source of truth on customer and prospect information. It houses contacts, deals, communication history, firmographic data, purchase history, and more. It offers a robust dashboard packed full of all the most important data that sales leaders and executives need and want. Plus, sales data can easily be shared with and accessed by the marketing and customer service teams as well. Great Analytics & Reporting Functions Salesforce puts all this data to use and provides great reporting, analyzing, and sales forecasting capabilities. These functions give sales leaders the ability to glean in-depth insights, spot trends and patterns, and monitor and track sales activity and deals. Extensive Customization Capabilities The Salesforce CRM platform offers a ton of sophisticated customization capabilities, including customized Salesforce lead mapping. Sales teams can customize the features of the dashboard and reporting to meet the specific needs of their business. Immense Ecosystem of Integrations Available The Salesforce AppExchange houses hundreds of apps that can seamlessly integrate with your Salesforce CRM, provided by a huge network of integration partners and service partners. These integrations can seamlessly share data with Salesforce and give your team a sales software stack that truly meets the needs of your team. Cons of Salesforce for Field Sales Teams: Does Not Streamline/Automate Sales Activities On its own, Salesforce CRM is essentially a data repository. All of that data, the robust dashboard, and the insight it offers is often very valuable for sales teams (especially sales leaders and executives). But, the CRM is not built to really help outside sales reps manage their day-to-day or automate activities like routing, logging activity, or prospecting. Can Become Too Complicated and Complex Because Salesforce’s platform is so robust and customizable, it often becomes too complex and cumbersome for sales reps to use. A lack of sales rep adoption is a key reason why deployments of CRMs like Salesforce often fail. Not As Mobile-Friendly as It Needs to Be for Outside Sales salesforce for outside sales The Salesforce mobile app is not particularly mobile-friendly. The Salesforce mobile app can be especially clunky for sales reps out in the field. Logging activity or adding customer notes from out in the field can end up being somewhat difficult. While out in the field, the CRM can end up wasting some of the time that it is supposed to be saving. Your Outside Sales Team Needs a Field-Friendly CRM Option You need a sales CRM for your team and Salesforce is one of the best. But it is important to understand that there is still a large percentage of sales CRM implementation/onboarding projects that fail. This is largely due to the software being used just as a data hub, inspection tool, and a source of versus a tool to improve the sales process. And when the CRM is for an outside sales team, this adds even another layer to the needs that the tool should be able to meet. To truly get value out of an investment in Salesforce, it is critical to make sure that your sales reps are logging their activities, notes, and customer updates in a timely and thorough manner. The data coming out of a CRM is only as good as what goes into it. But if they can’t easily do this on the go, it’s not going to happen. When a CRM creates additional administrative burdens for your outside sales reps, the quality and completeness of your data and insights can be jeopardized. Your reps may be put in a position of having to make a choice between keeping up CRM-related admin work and actually being out in the field selling. Time consuming administrative burdens reduces the opportunity for additional face-to-face time and relationship building. The best performing outside sales teams are led by executives that, when looking at their sales technology stack, focus on what value each particular tool brings to their outside reps. The simple fact is that if a tool brings value and is easy to use, full adoption quickly follows. With adoption across your entire sales team, you get complete and accurate data, and that data will produce the desired dashboards and insights that is so valuable to the management team. So, Salesforce is a great CRM in general, but by itself it may not meet the needs of today’s field sales teams. Not if they want to truly optimize their success. Outside sales reps need a CRM tool that not only manages all of the data but is easy to use in the field, helps to automate activities, makes their day-to-day easier, and helps streamline the sales process. To ensure your team’s success, it will be vital to meet these needs and ensure that all of the necessary data goes into Salesforce cleanly. The best way to do this is to use a mobile app that seamlessly integrates with Salesforce and acts as a sales-friendly front end.

Sales Marketing,"Home Sales Force: 3 Ways to Organise Your Sales Team organisation-force-vente.jpg Sales management Sales Force: 3 Ways to Organise Your Sales Team 7 min read · Listen Your product is starting to be known, customers are delighted and it seems that they are starting to use it more and more. Now is the time to promote your sales force. The first step in the process is, therefore, to know what the sales force is. Then we will see some examples that will help you sell more. But where should you start? At this point, it is normal to get stuck and not know how to do it. Imagine the salespeople acting like pirates screaming ""Prepare to board!"", setting out to sell without anything and nobody stopping them. The reality is quite different. Only a few salespeople are able to take such initiatives and achieve their goals without collateral damage. Many sales managers think that hiring the best sellers and letting them take care of everything is the cure for all their ills. After all, it's the smartest thing to do, right? However… According to a study from Exevi in Spain, only one in four companies defines itself as proactive in improving its processes, thanks to a well-documented and structured digital approach. If your idea was to hire a few salespeople to let them sell on their own (like pirates), unfortunately, this is very unlikely to work. Any approach to success will fail without an organizational structure that matches the value chain and culture of your business. What is sales force: definition and examples. Sales force is made up of all the people in the company whose function is to respond to demand with an offer. Generally, these are the members of the sales team whose mission is to achieve turnover. Sales promotion is generally a task managed by the sales team. Sales management is, among other things, responsible for: Defining the sales force strategy and objectives Creating and implementing the sales plan Recruiting, training and paying team members through incentives Sales management must also monitor and take the necessary measures to achieve the objectives set. Thanks to technological progress, the control of the sales force (its other name), is now done through commercial software, reporting, and management tools like commercial CRM solutions like efficy CRM. That being said, today we’ll be looking at three essential ways to manage your sales team. 3 ways to organize your sales team 1) Organization of an isolated, even lonely sales force This organization is based on the traditional expression ""sell or die"", so popular in the commercial world. Its poor organizational structure has only a few elements: Increase in sales skills. A range of products to promote and sell. A commission structure for each sale made. Sometimes an office. And that's all! Force de vente isolée Each salesperson is solely responsible during all phases of the sales process: it is he or she who must generate prospects, qualify them and close the sales. Do you know what's going on? Without a frame of reference, aggressiveness increases. In addition to the competition in the market with your competitors, competition is invited within the teams themselves. Take the example of a real estate agent responsible for promoting properties almost alone, he or she publishes offers on Internet, calls prospects by phone, shows them properties in the hope of closing the deal, regardless of the rest of the organization members or their goals. He or she quickly risks being lonely and wanting to crush his or her colleagues. Advantages of an isolated sales force organization: There is no need for individual supervision by team leaders. This organization is efficient in short sales cycles, sales processes, where the sale is concluded in one or two calls Disadvantages of organizing an isolated sales force: It creates an aggressive and very competitive environment. The company has less control over its brand image in the market. Indeed, it will depend entirely on the style of the salesperson. Everyone does it! And yet it is difficult to follow the measurements and the performances. 2) Organization of the sales force production chain It is a famous organization in the industrial field. It consists in organizing the production processes sequentially to obtain greater efficiency at each stage of the chain. This can also apply to salespeople to cultivate and refine the treatment of customers during the process. This organization thus divides your external or internal sales force into four different teams: Lead generation team. They attract prospects using commercial email templates in which they present the company's products and services. (See here some examples). Sales development representatives. They qualify the opportunity and adapt to customer needs, taking into account their decision-making cycle. Account managers. They are negotiators, they are the ones who conclude the contracts. Do they call qualified prospects, give demonstrations, respond to objections? One goal, to close the sale by phone or during a physical meeting. The team of success managers. The mission of this team is to monitor the level of satisfaction of the different types of customers, in order to increase their lifespan. (LTV for Life Time Value). Another objective is to do up-selling by selling a higher version of the product or even cross-selling by selling options or supplements. Force de vente par chaîne de montage This structure in the ""production chain"" allows your teams to specialize in different roles and functions. A dedicated team intervenes at each stage of the sales cycle. The suspects turn into prospects, then into qualified opportunities to finally become new customers. And at each stage, they pass into the hands of a different team. Having specialized teams, make it is easier to measure the results of each. You can already start this specialization with only two sales forces. One is dedicated to prospecting new customers, while the other is dedicated to signing sales. Based on the Pareto rule, “the 80-20 principle”, you will know when to set up new stations within the assembly line. When your salespeople spend more than 20% of their time on a secondary mission, perhaps it is time to create a new specialized sales team. Advantages of organizing the assembly line: Your business activity becomes more predictable and less random. You can isolate problems in the sales funnel to resolve them. Finally, more specialization is often synonymous with more efficiency. Disadvantages of the organization of the production chain: Dividing the funnel into different steps can increase the moments of friction when moving customers along the funnel. Since these are highly specialized teams, a disconnection between these teams and the company's general business objectives is common. Teams would tend to focus on their own results and parameters. /resource/5-ways-to-boost-your-sales/ 3) Organization of the sales force in capsules or clusters Tout comme sur la chaîne de montage, l’organisation en capsules se distingue par la constitution d’équipes étroitement unies, dans lesquelles nous retrouvons différents profils, tous ayant le même focus : le client. For example, a six-person sales capsule can be organized as follows: 3 representatives from business development, 2 account managers, And a success manager. Small groups with specific missions are created and each person is responsible for the entire journey of specific customers. Équipe de vente The roles are the same as in the organization seen above. Only here, the competition is between the capsules. Each capsule strives to win new customers, applies different sales techniques to close the deal and then dedicates itself to maintaining customer satisfaction. With the capsules, you get a more modular and flexible structure than with the traditional model. Success is measured by capsule, where each member of the sales force has a broader and holistic view of the business. Advantages of the sales force capsule organization As the capsules operate in solid groups, the members are not only involved in the stage of the process represented by their specialty (prospecting, qualification, signature, customer success) but also in the complete journey of the customer. There is often more empathy and better understanding among the members of each capsule. So there is less friction and more communication. The capsules are flexible and agile. Disadvantages of organizing a sales force capsule: There are fewer opportunities for sellers to measure themselves and be competitive. There is less specialization in each role because each member of the capsule must be able to do everything. The capsule structure of the sales force is a more refined version of the production chain. It is ideal for start-ups looking to optimize their commercial resources to attack new markets or new business sectors. When organizing your sales team, you need to achieve two basic goals: Maximize the results. Create the best culture for your organization. Always look at your competitors: how do they structure their sales teams? It is not necessary to imitate them, but if they do it in a certain way, it may be interesting to ask why. In short, to properly structure your sales team with or without hiring a sales manager, you just need to know which organization would yield the best results. For that, don't forget to ask yourself the following questions: ""What kind of team are we? What kind of culture are we trying to create? The team you create and the way you do it will give you the clues you need to know how your business is doing and where it is going. And if you want to know how to sell to your customers, apply these recommendations and try to see what types of sales would be most effective in your context.

Sales Marketing,"Why Salespeople hate Salesforce…and How We Can Help Them Love It Why Salespeople hate Salesforce…and How We Can Help Them Love It Salesforce.com Training Using Salesforce.com January 2, 2014 Salesforce.com and salespeople are in a love-hate relationship – in that Salesforce.com loves salespeople, but (many) salespeople hate Salesforce. One of the most common reasons cited by organizations for the failure of their Salesforce.com system is a lack of adoption by the sales team. Data isn’t inputted. Records aren’t kept up to date. And the value of the whole system is subsequently undermined. So why do so many salespeople take such a disliking to Salesforce.com? Sean McPheat, MD of MTD Sales Training, believes that the challenge that organizations face is the very nature of the beast itself – sales people love interacting with people, not with Salesforce.com. “Many sales people would rather make an additional ten calls per day or go out on another two prospect visits than update their records, especially as a lot of their commission is riding on the results that they achieve,” he explains. “Having said that, what the same sales people do not realize is that many of them miss out on following up with prospects, they forget crucial information and then using the data ongoing for marketing and farming purposes is a lot harder with incomplete or worse still, no records. “’I’m getting bogged down with paperwork and admin when I should be out selling’ is a common complaint I hear all the time from sales people. Whether it’s the forms they need to complete or the entries onto a computer to fulfil a new piece of business or whether it’s entering updates into Salesforce.com, the salesperson at times does not seem to see past their commission check and the activity required to bump their salary up to the levels that they need.” Helen Rutherford, director at training firm 2e2, agrees that some of it comes down to mindset. “Sales people don’t like using it because they don’t see how using the system benefits them personally,” she says. “A lot of sales people work in isolation, and get commission for their own actions. If they make a sale it does impact the wider business of course, but sales is a competitive environment and people will generally see a sale as a personal success. “With this in mind, it’s hard to justify the usefulness of entering information into a system that may enable someone else to capitalize on their hard work, and potentially lose them some commission. The best sales people are those who take pride in their work and have the competitive edge. The knock-on effect of hiring such people is that they’re unlikely to get the best out of Salesforce.com.” There are other attitudes amongst salespeople that can cause Salesforce.com to come unglued. John Cheney, CEO of Workbooks, for instance, believes that too often Salesforce.com, or any CRM system, for that matter, are viewed by salespeople as “a tool for managers to keep a close eye on their work” rather than a tool that enables them to be more successful. And Matt Garman, group commercial director at dhc, reports having often heard “I’ll get the sales and somebody else can sort that out”. “It is a laziness and unfortunately salespeople are often given more slack than other people in the firm,” he adds. The damage of a failure But while salespeople tend to get the blame, other factors also contribute to poor adoption in many cases. These include: A lack of IT/systems knowledge – “There are a lot of un-technical sales people out there, or not prepared to admit they don’t get it!” says Garman. Projects have been rolled out without consulting the users first – “Salesforce.com Implementation and Training projects fail because the company has decided to invest in a new piece of technology (decision at Board meeting – ‘wouldn’t it be great to have Salesforce.com’) without engaging with the rest of the business.” Over-complicated systems – “If they have to go too far out of their way, different logon, different software, etc. then they just won’t use it. Unfortunately, whatever the reason for poor adoption, the implications of a Salesforce.com Implementation failure can run far and wide. “The primary danger of a Salesforce.com adoption problem is that as a result of the system not being used and data not being inputted as it should, the data is of poor quality, is inaccurate and thus is not a useful tool for management and does not actively help the sales team,” says Cheney. “In cases such as these, Salesforce.com is seen an expensive burden.” Darron Walton, managing director of De Villiers Walton adds: “In a fast-paced sales environment, hours spent toiling over complex admin processes and pricing structures could mean a missed opportunity or target. Yet when sales and other Salesforce.com users bypass the system or add incorrect information, this can, in turn, contribute to an inaccurate picture of sales performance.” So how can organizations ensure that Salesforce.com is warmly embraced by its salespeople? We asked a handful of experts for their advice on how to make Salesforce.com and sales the perfect couple. Communicate clear objectives “Communicate with your sales people as to why Salesforce.com is important to the company as a whole and to them as individuals,” advises McPheat. “Many salespeople just see Salesforce.com as a way to keep to score and something that marketing use to send out mailings. With proper objectives and a clear vision for the CRM system your sales team can increase their buy in from the word go. You need to sell Salesforce.com system to the sales people! That does not include just a cascade. Telling is not selling! Instead you need to cover the business benefits and also the all-important question that each sales person will want answering ‘What’s in it for me?’ Get buy-in from the sales team “From experience, the best projects are company-wide decisions with buy in at all levels,” says Garman. “Leaders/directors need to lead and make sure they practice what they preach when it comes to implementation – all too often they make a call and then move on to the next meeting item without seeing it through.” McPheat adds: “Ask [the sales team] for their input in designing the system from the outset if you can and make it as simple for them to use as possible. The system should be molded around your sales process so at any stage your sales people know and understand where each of their prospects and clients are in the sales cycle. The people that are going to use it should be the ones to help shape what it looks like and to have an important say in what it should and could do.” Change mindsets by explaining putting Salesforce.com in context for salespeople “In order for Salesforce.com to work, employee mindsets have to change – however, businesses need to help with this,” says Rutherford. “Salespeople will understand the use of having a single repository of customer information. If such a system leads to happier customers, stronger relationships and, ultimately, more sales then sales teams should buy into it.” Demonstrate the ROI “Communicate any ‘wins’ that you have with the system,” recommends McPheat. “Any deals that were won due to its deployment, any potential problems that were avoided or any data that you are now able to analyse and hence have made some process improvements off the back of it. All of these add fuel to the fire and make using Salesforce.com a way of life and a ‘need to do’ rather than a ‘have to do’.” Listen to feedback from your sales team “Most businesses are highly dependent on their sales team for the capturing of key data needed to fulfill orders and to invoice, and hence salespeople are the key to successfully implementing Salesforce.com,” explains Cheney. “Listening to their needs and complaints then acting on their feedback is a sure way to encourage the adoption of Salesforce.com. You may find it helpful to liaise directly with a certified Salesforce.com Training provider, as they will be able to help you identify ways to make the software easier to adopt. It’s also worth ‘championing’ those salespeople who do adopt the system and offering them incentives.” Ensure the management set an example “Your sales directors and managers will play a major role in how Salesforce.com is adopted throughout your organization,” emphasizes McPheat. “Will it be seen as a ‘divide and rule’ system used for sales person bashing, checking up all the time and for nit picking? Or will the system be used as something that really adds value to the sales process and one that enables the sales managers and sales directors to mentor and coach their sales people to a greater level of performance?” Keep Salesforce.com simple “In our experience, the reason many sales users get frustrated with Salesforce.com is because it is too complex,” says Walton. “Often, they are forced to comply with data-intensive screens and complete mandatory fields that are not always specifically relevant to their everyday sales role. And when faced with adapting to a new system, users that do not have the time to learn how to use the system – or do not see the benefits of the new process in their day to day life – will reject the system, bypass the important fields or add false information.” Garman adds: “The key is make it simple – after all 40% of activities recorded in a basic system is better than nothing in a fancy one. Don’t do too much too soon and make it manageable.

Concepts, Products, and Services EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) Available in: All Editions As you get started with Salesforce, it’s helpful to learn some key concepts and terms. They come up frequently when you interact with the product, our documentation, and our service professionals. The concepts and terms here help you understand how Salesforce works. Concepts Concept Definition A Salesforce name for a loose federation of features that help you accomplish certain types activities, such as selling products or supporting your customers. Two common examples are Service Cloud and Sales Cloud. Cloud Technology that enables Internet-based services that let you sign up and log in through a browser. Salesforce delivers its service in the cloud. Other familiar cloud computing services include Google Apps and Amazon.com. Cloud Computing 3 Get Started with Salesforce Concepts, Products, and Services Concept Definition Software delivered not by traditional means (such as on disk) but in the cloud, as a service. There’s nothing to download or install, and updates are automatic. Software as a Service (SaaS) A Salesforce term for its company-wide commitment to building and delivering the most secure, fast, and reliable cloud-based service available. trust.salesforce.com is a systems status website that provides Salesforce customers and the community access to real-time and historical system performance information and updates. It also lists incident reports and maintenance schedules across all its key system components. Trust trust.salesforce.com is free to all members of the Salesforce community. Products and Services Salesforce includes these products and services. Product or Service Description Salesforce includes prebuilt applications (or “apps”) for customer relationship management (CRM) ranging from sales force automation to partner relationship management, marketing, and customer service. Salesforce Applications The Lightning platform is the first platform as a service (PaaS). Developers can create and deliver any kind of business application entirely on demand and without software. The platform also includes easy Lightning Platform to use point-and-click customization tools to help you create solutions for your unique business requirements, without any programming experience. AppExchange is a marketplace featuring hundreds of cloud applications created by Salesforce customers, developers, and partners. Many of the applications are free and all of them are pre-integrated with Salesforce, enabling you to easily and efficiently add functionality. AppExchange Salesforce provides training, support, consulting, events, best practices, and discussion boards to help you be successful. Visit Salesforce.com Community. Salesforce.com Community Terms Term Definition Short for application. A collection of components such as tabs, reports, dashboards, and Visualforce pages that address specific business needs.

All Salesforce editions share the look and feel, but they vary by feature, functionality, and pricing. Edition A definition of a specific type of information you can store in Salesforce. For example, the Case object lets you store information about customer inquiries. For each object, your organization has multiple, specific records. Salesforce comes with lots of standard objects, but you can create custom objects, as well. Object 4 Get Started with Salesforce Concepts, Products, and Services Term Definition A deployment of Salesforce that has a defined set of licensed users. Your organization includes all your data and applications. Organization A collection of fields that store information about a specific item of a specific type. A record is an object, such as a contact, an account, or an opportunity. For example, you can have a contact record to store information about Joe Smith, and a case record store information about his training inquiry. Record Salesforce releases new products and features three times per year, and we identify releases by season—Winter, Spring, and Summer—along with the calendar year. Example: Winter ’15. For every Salesforce release, the Salesforce release notes include new features and products that are generally available or in beta release. They also describe all changes to existing features and products. You can find the release notes when you search for “Release Notes” in the Salesforce Help. Release Salesforce The name of the Salesforce cloud computing CRM service and the company name. The Salesforce Admin The Salesforce administrator—or “admin” is a Salesforce user with system administration duties and other super powers. Admins are responsible for setting up Salesforce for their organizations and making sure it runs smoothly. Admins have special permissions. For example, they can add user accounts and specify what people can see and do in Salesforce. Admins can create custom Salesforce objects, workflows, validation rules, reports, and more. Admins can manage user profile information and delete Chatter feed updates, including posts and comments. Admins are planners, problem-solvers, and heroes. All Salesforce organizations have at least one administrator. Your administrator’s role can be as simple or as complex as your company’s size and structure. In smaller organizations, the admin is often someone who also uses Salesforce the way other users do: to sell products or provide customer service, for example. Salesforce offers lots of features and items that you can set up and configure yourself. For some things, though, partner with your trusty admin to help you get the best of what Salesforce has to offer. Here are a few examples of the kinds of things your admin can help you with or do for you. • Find or use an object, field, or feature you heard about during training. • Create a custom workflow that lets you find out when a case is closed. • Create a custom approval process that allows you to sign off on employee expenses. • Create a custom report for your sales region. • Give you a user permission that’s not granted as part of your user profile. • Answer questions about your own or others’ access to records. • Address those cursed error messages that ask you to contact your administrator for help or more information. How you contact your administrator, and when and why, depends on your company’s internal business policies and practices. What Happens When You Purchase Salesforce New to Salesforce, or maybe you’re not so new? In either case, to get the most out of Salesforce, it helps to know how your org is created and the types of licenses, permissions, and profiles that you receive. Understanding how these elements interact and impact what users can do saves you time. 5 Get Started with Salesforce The Salesforce Admin When your order is activated, our provisioning process creates a license request. The license request includes definitions that build out your org. These definitions consist of settings that indicate which licenses, permissions, and profiles you receive. It’s these basic elements that shape the org that you use and what users can do in it. You probably know that we offer different license types. Think of them as org-level and user-level licenses. You can also purchase permission set licenses and add-on licenses. Org-Level Licenses When you purchase Salesforce, you purchase an org-level license, or edition. An edition defines your: • Features, such as contracts or Collaborative Forecasts • Amounts, such as quantity of storage and the number of sandboxes To check how much storage or the number of sandboxes that your org has, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Storage Usage or Sandboxes. User-Level Licenses Your org receives a specific number of user licenses, such as Salesforce or Chatter Free user licenses. A user license defines: • User permissions, such as Activate Contracts or View All Forecasts • CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) access allowed on objects, such as who can create a contract or delete an account When you create users, you assign each one to a user license. A user license defines the permissions or the maximum capabilities that a user can have. To see which user licenses your org has, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Company Information, and then select User Licenses. Permission Set Licenses Permission set licenses let you offer more functionality to users in your org. An example of a permission set license is Identity Connect. When you purchase a permission set license, you receive user permissions pertaining to the license and the accompanying CRUD permissions. For example, with Identity Connect, you receive the Use Identity Connect permission, which allows assigned users to use the feature. To check which permission set licenses your org has, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Company Information, and select Permission Set Licenses. Add-On Licenses Your org receives a specific number of user licenses, such as Salesforce or Chatter Free user licenses. A user license defines: • User permissions, such as Activate Contracts or View All Forecasts • CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) access allowed on objects, such as who can create a contract or delete an account When you create users, you assign each one to a user license. A user license defines the permissions or the maximum capabilities that a user can have. To see which user licenses your org has, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Company Information, and then select User Licenses. Add-on licenses extend functionality at the org level. An example is the purchase of more API requests to extend the limit for your org. 6 Get Started with Salesforce What Happens When You Purchase Salesforce Permissions User permissions specify: • Tasks that users can perform • Features that users can access in your org configuration The base user permissions, such as Activate Contracts or View All Forecasts, that someone has depends on the user license assigned. You can use profiles and permission sets to refine which permissions a group of users has. For example, users with the View All Forecasts permission can view other users’ forecasts, but they must have the correct user license. If you assign the Chatter Free user license to users, they do not receive the View All Forecasts permission because this user license does not offer it. To find which user license a user is assigned, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Users. Click the name of the user whose information you want to view. Look for User License. Profiles You can have standard profiles and custom profiles, depending on the edition that you purchase. Profiles define: • User access to objects and data • What users can do within the org When you create users, you assign each user a profile. A profile belongs to exactly one user license type. Let’s say that your purchase comes with the Salesforce and Chatter Free license types, among others. You assign profiles to users based on these licenses. For example, based on the Salesforce user license, you can assign the System Administrator, Standard User, or one of several other profiles to a user. Based on the Chatter Free user license, you can assign only the Chatter Free User or Chatter Moderator User profiles to users. You can create custom profiles to offer different permissions or functionality to users with the same user license. However, using a permission set is typically a more efficient way to achieve the same goal. (Make sure that the permissions defined in the profile or permission set don’t exceed the permissions defined in the user license, though.) For example, you can assign a profile to a group of users. Then, you can assign users different permission sets to give certain people in that group more capabilities. 7 Get Started with Salesforce What Happens When You Purchase Salesforce To see which profile and permission sets that a user is assigned, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Users. Click the name of the user whose information you want to view. To check the assigned profile, look for Profile. Click Permission Set License Assignments or Permission Set Assignments: Activation Required for permission set information. SEE ALSO: Salesforce Editions Data and File Storage Allocations Licenses Overview Push Updated Licenses to Sandbox Orgs As your organization’s needs change, your licensing needs evolve. When you update licenses, you want your production and sandbox orgs to be in sync. Often you can refresh your sandbox to ensure that its licensing information matches your production org’s. Or, to ensure that your sandbox orgs receive updated license information, you can use the Match Production Licenses to Sandbox tool. When you use the Match Production Licenses to Sandbox tool, all provisioned changes are matched in the production org. To match licenses to a sandbox org, make sure that the status of the related production org is active. Then log in to your sandbox. From Setup, go to Company Information, and select Match Production Licenses. Warning: If the sandbox’s related production environment is in trial or demo status, do not use the matching tool. Using the tool with a trial or demo org can result in destructive changes. If you’re unsure whether the sandbox’s production org is in active status, log a case with Salesforce Customer Support. They can confirm your org’s status before you use the tool. License Updates and Your Org When you purchase Salesforce, you receive licenses, permissions, and profiles that shape your org and what users can do in it. You can also create permission sets to help with permission management. Understand the impact of license updates on permissions in your profiles and permission sets. Changes to your org impact its functionality and your users. For instance, what happens if you upgrade your Salesforce edition? Or maybe you decide to purchase an add-on license. Let’s say that your org: • Upgraded from Professional Edition to Enterprise Edition • Uses Service Cloud, and you purchased the additional functionality that the SOS add-on offers After you upgrade: • You want to use approval processes. Review the relevant user and object-level permissions for users who are approval admins. • Ensure that you enable related features for the SOS add-on. Give users who need the add-on the correct permissions. For best results, use Salesforce Help to set up your add-on. For example, you must enable Omni-Channel in your org before you set up SOS. Each org is different, and each user has different requirements. When you purchase an upgrade or add-on, we suggest reviewing help topics and videos in Salesforce Help and checking user permissions. 8 Get Started with Salesforce Push Updated Licenses to Sandbox Orgs To see which profile and permission sets that a user is assigned, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Users. Click the name of the user whose information you want to view. To check the assigned profile, look for Profile.

Sales Marketing,"What is Salesforce? The Ultimate Guide for 2024 By Simplilearn Share This Article: Last updated on Oct 10, 2023210876 What is Salesforce? The Ultimate Guide for 2024 With the growing data generation, businesses are required to leverage a platform that helps them make use of their customer data well, and Salesforce is one such CRM platform. Salesforce is used by startups to Fortune 500 companies. In this Salesforce tutorial, you will walk through what is Salesforce and how beneficial it is. Check out the following video to learn about Salesforce - Why Use Salesforce? Before moving to understand what is Salesforce, this tutorial will acquaint you with the term CRM. Back in time, employees managed manually data. They jotted down information and stored them in files. This way, they failed to make use of all the available data. Gradually, as years passed by with the advent of computers, companies made use of Excel sheets and documents for managing their data. However, this approach proved to be time-consuming and inefficient when handling large volumes of data. There was a requirement to effectively handle and analyze vast volumes of user data by every employee in the organization. By the term effective, it refers to methods that could be incorporated to improve customer satisfaction. This was when CRM, known as customer relationship management, was introduced, and it addressed the above issues. Initially, customer relationship management (CRM) solutions were hosted on a company's server. This became time-consuming and highly expensive. Such CRMs were also challenging to use. The solution was to build an affordable and cost-effective CRM software and provide it entirely online as a service. This was the core idea behind Salesforce.

Salesforce Architecture This tutorial will now briefly walk you through the Salesforce architecture. Here, you will be acquainted with the different layers of the Salesforce architecture individually. Multi-tenant: Salesforce stores data in a single database schema. There can be a single instance of a software server with multiple tenants. Speaking about a multi-tenant architecture, there is a single shared application service to several clients. This makes it cost-effective. On the contrary, in a single-tenant, the development and maintenance cost must be entirely owned by one client. Hence the multi-tenant architecture is a boon. Metadata: Salesforce uses a metadata-driven development model. This allows developers to only focus on building the application. This metadata-driven platform makes customization and scaling up easy. API: Salesforce provides a powerful source of APIs. This helps in developing and customizing the Salesforce1 Mobile App. Every feature of the Salesforce design has been planned and implemented precisely.

Better Time Management Time management is a huge benefit of Salesforce and one of the best ways to allow a business to grow and thrive. Thanks to comprehensive customer information and useful planning resources, you have everything you need in one place. No more time wasted searching through logs and files for important info. With so much pertinent customer data, you can easily prioritize work for (and with) your clients by streamlining the sales funnel so that leads are quickly transformed into customers. Salesforce also has a calendar feature that makes it easy to plan projects, meetings, phone calls, and more in one place. You’ll know what’s coming up and when. 2. Ultimate Accessibility Since Salesforce is cloud software, it’s accessible anywhere and everywhere you have access to the Internet. Whether you use your desktop, laptop, or smartphone, Salesforce can be reached thanks to its app. This is important because many business owners and team members travel frequently, be it nationally, internationally, or even between cities. Being able to reach your CRM tool through the protected cloud no matter where you are makes it easier to access important files and stay updated on clients. Sensitive information is more secure than it would be in a file cabinet or on a local server. 3. Increased Revenue Without Salesforce, running a business in today’s world can cost you money. On any given day, your team might produce a ton of data that has to be stored. Without Salesforce, you’re most likely sorting through this data manually, and this is more time spent on administrative work as opposed to building customer relationships. When your time is tied up, it means you have less time to improve business, make connections, and grow profits. Since the tool takes over these administrative duties and more, you’ll have more time to devote to the business, which means more money in the long run. 4. Greater Customer Satisfaction Similar to increased revenue, it’s safe to assume customers are more satisfied when they interact with a business that knows their needs and the state of their relationship with you (thanks to your CRM tool). Spend less time on administrative duties and you’ll have more time to spend catering to your customers through a common platform. Thanks to a highly efficient management system, you can serve your customers better by having quicker access to their information, accounts, purchase history, and preferences. This Salesforce benefit not only improves your relationship with your customers – it sets you up for new customers too. When your current customers are happy with you, they’re more likely to be an ambassador for you and tell their friends. 5. Simple Account Planning Salesforce makes it simple to create plans for accounts. With all the customer information you need readily accessible, you’ll have an easier time placing that info into the correct accounts, and then making plans for those accounts for optimal results for the customer. Customers get products or services perfectly tailored to their needs, you stay organized, and you adjust your time effectively for each client. As these accounts are created, stronger connections are made with your clients by best meeting their needs, solving their problems, and keeping track of trends. 6. Trusted Reporting With so much data pouring into your business, it’s easy to become lost. Salesforce keeps pertinent data organized and it helps you make sense of new data thanks to trustworthy reporting. Keep track of all the data your business collects from social media, website analytics, app information, business software, and more. Reporting takes this mountain of information and sorts it, analyzes it, and makes it actionable. With the accuracy of Salesforce tech, you know the numbers are right and the readings can be trusted. 7. Improved Team Collaboration Lastly, team collaboration is a major benefit of Salesforce. The software allows you to connect and communicate with team members from anywhere thanks to the “Chatter” feature. This lets you connect with individual team members or full groups and chat about everything from your clients and their information to other work-related topics such as territory and product/service details. When the team is on the same page, your business is more cohesive and operates more efficiently so that deadlines are met and sales are finalized.

Sales Marketing,"Why Use HubSpot: The Benefits of HubSpot Marketing & Sales Software Previous Next This article was reviewed and updated September 2021. It's Worth Your Time to Understand the Benefits and Features of HubSpot. We Promise. Throughout life, we have to make some pretty important decisions, such as choosing a college major, deciding on a career path, and saying yes or no to a potentially life-changing job opportunity. If you're a business owner or you work in marketing, an important decision you may have to make is ""Which marketing platform should we use?"" Which is probably why you are reading this blog article. At TANK New Media we love HubSpot, inbound marketing, growth-driven design, and coffee. In fact, we love them so much that we eat, sleep, and breathe them (probably the reason for our coffee obsession). Now it's your turn to fall in love with them, too. But it all starts with HubSpot. But why use HubSpot? Here's an overview of the benefits and features of the platform. What is HubSpot? As the inbound approach to marketing and sales has become an increasingly popular and effective method for business growth, it's no surprise that there's an abundance of tools that are available to marketers. Deciding on which tools to use, figuring out if they can work together, and implementing them can be a struggle. This is when you start to fall in love with HubSpot, because it's all your tools in one platform. If this is your first interaction with it, you may be asking ""What is HubSpot?"" Well, in short, HubSpot is an inbound marketing & sales software that helps companies attract visitors, convert leads, and close customers. The platform is designed as a one-stop-shop to help you execute inbound marketing from beginning to end, replacing all of those other various marketing tools (think Google Spreadsheets, SalesForce, HootSuite, etc.) Let's dive in and find out what makes this robust platform highly attractive. HubSpot Marketing Software — Everything You Need in One Place for an Effective Marketing Campaign The marketing software of HubSpot's platform can take most, if not all, of the various marketing tools you're already using and unite them or replace them. HubSpot's marketing platform is for creating and promoting buyer-driven content using the following features. Blogging HubSpot's fully integrated blogging platform equips you or your content creators with a powerful tool to generate traffic to your website. Engaging content is a must for inbound marketing. HubSpot makes it easy to write, format, and edit blog content with their on-page editor that allows you to start a post from scratch or use one of their pre-made blog templates. HubSpot makes your SEO optimization ""easy like Sunday morning."" While creating your blog content, you can get as-you-type keyword suggestions and SEO advice in order to outrank your competitors for your keywords that matter. Now it's time to promote, promote, promote! Get your blog in front of the right people at the right time with HubSpot's calendar tool. Plan your editorial calendar and schedule your posts to publish at the best times. Even connect your social media accounts to automatically share the new content. Your subscribers can receive your blogs automatically as they are published with customizable subscriber emails. After all that hard work you'll want to see how your blog post performed. HubSpot's built-in analytics tool will identify which posts are generating traffic, leads, and customers so you know what content drives results. Landing Pages If you could do one thing to dramatically improve your marketing ROI, it would be to use landing pages on your website. How can you do that on HubSpot? HubSpot provides a built-in-library of mobile-optimized templates, or you can build a landing page from the ground up with their user-friendly editor. Want to preview what your page will look like on mobile, an iPad and desktop before publishing? HubSpot's got you covered! The beauty of this feature is you don't need a designer or IT person to launch a professional looking landing page. You can display personalized content, calls-to-action (CTA), and forms for each and every visitor to improve the performance of your landing pages. Dynamically show different content based on a visitor’s location, source, device, buying stage, or any other contact detail stored in your CRM. Once your landing page is live, you can analyze its performance and perform A/B tests on every element in order drive the most conversions. Just like the blog feature, you can also get customized keyword suggestions while writing. The opportunities are endless! Email Again, ""Why Go HubSpot?"" you ask. Well, there's no need for designers or an IT person to create a professional email design. With HubSpot's drag-and-drop feature you can maneuver your way to reusable, branded email templates, or choose from their extensive library. You can tailor your emails to each subscriber to generate a higher open rate with name personalization. HubSpot can tap into your subscriber's lifecycle stage, list membership' and other information stored in the CRM to serve up the most relevant subject lines, links, and CTA. The best part? You can schedule your email campaign then sit back and relax knowing your emails will show up in each inbox at the most optimal time, regardless of time zones. Voilà! Marketing Automation Lead your leads (see what we did there?) through their own path to close more deals with marketing automation. With marketing automation, you can use each lead's behavior to tailor emails, content, offers, and outreach at scale. Automate your email campaigns so you can move prospects further down the funnel and generate more qualified leads. You can choose from dozens of triggers, conditions, and actions to send the right emails to the right leads at the right time. Guess what? Automation isn't just for email. You can automate a variety of tasks and trigger internal notifications to your team when a contact makes a noteworthy action so they know with whom to follow up. Now that's fancy! Lead Management How much time have you or your sales team wasted combining data from disconnected tools and databases? With HubSpot's lead management you can access every detail about a lead in a single profile. It also provides you with a chronological timeline of every touchpoint between a contact and your company — such as emails, page visits, social media interactions, and downloads — so you never miss a beat! The best part is that HubSpot's inbound marketing platform and HubSpot's free CRM work together seamlessly. Note this — If you're using Salesforce as your CRM, there's a Salesforce and HubSpot integration available. Talk about database power! Website Have we mentioned HubSpot makes things easy? Just like the landing pages, and emails, you can also build entire websites from scratch with ease with a simple drag-and-drop builder. Content can be personalized for every type of visitor, and those SEO recommendations to get your website to the top of Googles search. With HubSpot: Your site is mobile optimized from the start. Your pages will automatically adjust to any device your visitor may have. You can see what your site will look like on any device. Is their website tracking you ask? Why of course! With HubSpot's integrated analytics you can measure just about anything you need on your website! Download Brand Strategy Worksheet Analytics You want data? HubSpot supports your results-driven thirst! Measure your whole marketing funnel from acquisition to close. No one wants to waste time with leads that aren't qualified. This software can measure the quantity and quality of traffic you are getting to your website. Analyze how your pages are performing and which traffic sources bring the most visits, contacts, and customers over time. Once you know which sources are driving the highest value — feed the winners! The analytics tool provides you with detailed reports for every one of your marketing assets including websites, landing pages, emails, blog posts, social media accounts, and so on. You'll have all the data you need to take over the world! Muahaha! SEO Why was the SEO expert so frustrated on his way to work? Too much traffic...go figure! With HubSpot SEO, you won't experience frustration, but you will have plenty of traffic (the good kind!). You'll never miss a ranking opportunity. HubSpot will identify the right keywords and topics to target in your content so you can gain visibility from keywords that matter. You can even see how your competitors are ranking for the keywords you are targeting in a single dashboard. Utilize this data to modify your SEO strategy. Social Media Publishing & Monitoring In case we haven't mentioned, HubSpot keeps things easy. That's why you can publish to social networks in the same place that you build campaigns. Share content — blog posts, landing pages, and more — directly to LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ quickly and easily. Plus you can connect your social accounts to your company's blog for seamless automatic publishing. Don't want to post something right away? Schedule content to get in front of your followers at the right moment. HubSpot's social media monitoring allows you to connect with people who matter. Social interactions are linked to real people in your database which enables you to prioritize conversations with people interested in engagement. And never miss an opportunity to engage, nurture leads, or delight customers with trigger email alerts when a prospect mentions you, a specific keyword, or hashtag. Dive deeper and create custom keyword monitoring streams for team members to surface the interactions they care about. HubSpot makes the struggle of reporting social media ROI a thing of the past. All of your marketing is integrated with your CRM so you can see the number of visits, leads, and customers your social media is generating for your company. Calls-to-Action Once your readers ingest your content, what do you want them to do? Visit your website? Schedule a sales meeting? Download a content offer? That's where CTA's come in handy! HubSpot's CTA builder creates professional CTA buttons or pop-ups in a few easy steps. Insert them into web pages, landing pages, blog posts, etc. to turn every piece of content into a conversion machine. People like personalization, so attract them with personalized CTA's by using any detail in your contacts database. HubSpot can even tailor CTAs to anonymous visitors based on their location, device, referral source, or preferred language. Therefore everyone gets a customized experience! Test your CTAs with A/B testing to create data-driven decisions and say goodbye to the guesswork. Ads Sadly, ad clicks don't equal instant money in your company's bank account. HubSpot's ads add-on reaches beyond traditional ad metrics to report on actual leads and ROI generated by every single Facebook and AdWords ad. This way you can know exactly how your paid ads are performing. Your HubSpot list can be utilized to form a bond with a Facebook Ads audience. This eliminates manual uploads and enables automatic targeting of prospects. You don't have to manage your AdWords and Facebook ads on their separate platforms. All of your ad creation can be completed and managed inside HubSpot. Leads generated with those ads will instantly go into your HubSpot CRM. Salesforce Integration We all strive for harmony, especially when it comes to our marketing and sales databases. With HubSpot you can do exactly just that. HubSpot syncs with Salesforce with an easy phone-based setup process. Plus, you get a team of engineers and support staff to maintain and improve your integration. You will never have to export a list from Salesforce to kick off a campaign or personalize a marketing email. If your sales team closes a lead, Salesforce will send the data right into HubSpot. Are you done asking ""Why Go HubSpot?"" yet? We're still going strong with reasons to use HubSpot. Let's look at the sales software features. Get Started Creating Your Digital Marketing Plan HubSpot Sales Software — Time-Saving Sales Tools to Help You Sell More and Work Less HubSpot Sales Pro helps you connect with the right people at the right time with the right message. Also, HubSpot Sales Pro gives you everything you need to increase productivity, shorten deal cycles, and make the sales process more human-friendly without adding to your workload. These following features will have your sales team cranking out leads and closing deals. Sales Automation Similar to the Marketing Software's automation, HubSpot's Sales Software takes all of those manual and time-consuming tasks that your sales reps do on a daily basis and automates them. Rotate leads, create deals and tasks, and more. Pipeline Management You want to focus on the right deals, right? HubSpot's Pipeline Management features help you do just that. The CRM will swiftly create new deals when adding them from a contact or company record by populating most of the deals automatically with the most up-to-date information. So, less time on data entry and more time for prospecting! The pipeline management is also customizable to you so you can create your ideal process. Use the sales dashboard to check your progress toward sales quotas so you are always in the know. Email Scheduling You won't even have to leave your Gmail account to schedule an email. Simply click the schedule icon on your Gmail composition window and choose a time. How efficient! Emails are all about timing. Get your emails to the top of your recipient's inbox at the best time. You can choose from several pre-selected times based on data, or select your own. While emails are scheduled, you can still go in and edit them before they are sent out. No more anxiety of constantly checking your email! Email Sequences By automating your follow-up, you instantly have more time put back into your day! Send a series of timed emails to your prospect so you never lose touch. Choose from a list of messages, and enroll a contact right from your inbox. Just because your automating emails, doesn't mean you have to be impersonal. Use personalization tokens to tailor the emails in your sequence with contact and company details from HubSpot CRM or Salesforce. Then add a human touch to your email with specific details. HubSpot will supply you with data so you know what sequences are working the best for you so you can optimize your email for the best results. Email Tracking Eliminate the guesswork with email tracking! Get a notification the second a lead opens an email and clicks a link inside. These notifications will aid you in sending a perfectly timed follow up. The tracking history includes an activity stream that automatically logs each leads history inside HubSpot Sales. Email Templates In sales, you are always sending repetitive emails. With HubSpot's email templates you can turn your most effective and repetitive emails into templates that are accessed right in your email inbox when composing an email. HubSpot has a library of built-in templates, or you can make your own. Imagine the hours you will save! Real-time metrics show you which templates are performing and which ones need some TLC. Your open rates tell you which subject lines your leads and customers can’t help but click. Document Tracking HubSpot has a one-stop-shop for all of your sales documentation. You have the ability to build and share one document or an entire library of your sales content for your entire team to access. When a lead opens a document, you will be instantly notified so you can follow up in a timely and relevant way. Optimize your documents and personalize your pitch by seeing who views each document and which pages they spend time on. Calling HubSpot's calling and call tracking feature will prioritize and create a queue for your daily sales calls using engagement and property dating from the CRM so you can spend less time dialing and more time selling! A really nifty feature of this tool is the fact you don't ever have to leave your browser or pick up a phone to place a call. With one click you are connected to a prospect through Voice Over IP on your desk phone. Your calls will always come from your personal number with the option to record each call so nothing gets missed! Say goodbye to grunt work! All calls are automatically logged to HubSpot CRM or Salesforce. Live Chat With HubSpot's Sales Pro live chat tool, you can connect directly with prospects in real time when they’re actively engaging with your website — which is the perfect time as they are interested and active in the buying process. With the live chat tool, conversations can be routed to the right sales person to build better relationships and close more deals. Leads and conversations are seamlessly synced into HubSpot so sales rep, can continue to nurture those relationships as well as schedule follow-up tasks. Again, no need for an IT person to get this up and running! All you have to do is grab the code snippet and embed it on any page on your website you want live chat to appear! Just like that, everything is connected. Your live chat window's look and feel is also customizable. Meeting Scheduling The back-and-forth meeting scheduling is a thing of the past with HubSpot's meeting widgets. The power now lies in the hands of your prospects, and they like it! Meeting widgets sync with your calendar so prospects can see your real-time availability. These widgets and schedulers can be placed on your website and in emails. Send group meeting links to allow prospects to book time with more than one person in your organization.

At its heart, HubSpot is a complete software system forinbound marketing, a methodology that attracts customers by providing valuable content and customized solutions. This approach differs markedly from traditional outbound marketing, which relies on more direct and often intrusive promotion techniques. HubSpot’s story begins in 2006, when co-founders Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah, noticing a fundamental shift in consumer behavior, realized that traditional marketing methods were becoming less effective. So they developed HubSpot with the goal of helping companies adapt to this change by focusing on inbound marketing techniques. Since then, HubSpot has steadily evolved, becoming not just a marketing software, but a comprehensive platform that supports all stages of customer acquisition and management, from first interaction to retention. This evolution has allowed HubSpot to remain at the forefront of digital marketing, offering tools that meet the needs of a rapidly changing marketplace.

What can be done with HubSpot? HubSpot is a versatile platform that offers a wide range of features to support different areas of digital business. Here is a list of some of its key features, accompanied by concrete examples of how they can be applied in various business scenarios: Comprehensive CRM: At the heart of HubSpot is a powerful CRM system that enables companies to manage and analyze interactions with customers and prospects. For example, a company can use HubSpot’s CRM to track the entire customer lifecycle, from lead to loyalty, gaining a complete and detailed view of their needs and behaviors. Marketing Automation: HubSpot enables the automation of complex marketing campaigns. An e-commerce company, for example, can use automation to send personalized emails to customers based on their purchase history, incentivizing repeat transactions or suggesting related products. Content Management: With its integrated CMS, HubSpot helps companies create, manage and optimize their web content. A travel agency can leverage this feature to create engaging blogs and landing pages that attract and convert visitors into customers.

A manufacturing company can use these analytics to understand which marketing channels generate the most leads and optimize advertising spend accordingly. In summary, HubSpot offers an all-in-one solution that fits a variety of business needs, improving operations, optimizing marketing and sales strategies, and elevating the customer experience. Its features are designed to be intuitive and easily integrated, making them suitable for businesses of all sizes and industries. Hubspot Contact Management and CRM One of the key aspects of HubSpot is its robust contact management and CRM (customer relationship management) platform. Central to its effectiveness is the ability to centralize and organize all customer interactions and information in one accessible place. This allows companies to have a 360-degree view of each customer, making it easier to personalize the approach and improve relationships. Contact management in HubSpot is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to track every interaction with customers, from email messages to in-person meetings. This data collection provides a detailed picture of customer preferences and behavior, which can be leveraged for targeted marketing campaigns and more effective customer service. In addition, HubSpot’s CRM platform is designed to integrate seamlessly with other marketing, sales and service capabilities. This means that, for example, sales teams can access detailed lead information directly from the CRM, allowing them to tailor their sales techniques to the specific needs and interests of each potential customer. In addition, CRM automation features save companies valuable time by automating processes such as contact registration and interaction management. HubSpot’s approach to contact management and CRM not only simplifies day-to-day operations, but also provides a solid foundation for building and maintaining lasting relationships with customers. Through this platform, companies can not only better understand their customers, but also act on this information to create more engaging and personalized experiences. Marketing Automation with Hubspot HubSpot’s ability to automate numerous marketing processes is one of its most significant strengths. Marketing automation through HubSpot results in a series of actions and processes automatically managed by the platform, ranging from sending personalized emails to customer segmentation to managing lead nurturing campaigns. These capabilities not only optimize operational efficiency, but also offer large-scale customization that was unthinkable with traditional techniques. The platform allows the creation of customized automation paths based on customer actions. For example, if a site visitor downloads an e-book, HubSpot can automatically send a series of related emails to further guide the user through the sales funnel. This ability to react in real time to user behavior enables companies to remain relevant and engaging, increasing the likelihood of conversion. The benefits of marketing automation are many. First, it saves valuable time by automating repetitive tasks, allowing marketing teams to focus on more creative strategies and ideas. Second, it improves the consistency and accuracy of marketing campaigns, reducing human error and ensuring that the right messages reach the right audience at the right time. Finally, it provides real-time analysis and data that can be used to continuously optimize marketing strategies. In short, the marketing automation offered by HubSpot is not just about efficiency, but a fundamental change in the way companies can engage and convert their audiences. Marketing automation through HubSpot transforms the way companies interact with customers and optimize their marketing strategies. A concrete example is the personalization of email campaigns. Imagine a visitor who leaves his or her email address on your site to receive a white paper. HubSpot can automatically initiate a sequence of personalized emails based on this behavior, first sending a thank-you message, followed by a series of informational emails related to the downloaded content, gradually increasing engagement. Another example involves customer segmentation. Suppose your company offers several products or services. With HubSpot, you can create customer segments based on their interests or previous interactions with your site. This allows you to send targeted and relevant communications, such as specific promotions or relevant content, significantly increasing the likelihood of conversion. In addition, automation can be used for lead nurturing. For example, if a potential customer shows interest in a certain type of product but does not proceed to purchase, HubSpot can automatically initiate a nurturing path by providing additional information, testimonials from other customers, or special offers to gently guide the lead toward a purchase decision. Finally, think about using HubSpot to manage events or webinars. From automatic invitation sending, to registration, to post-event follow-up, every aspect can be automated and customized, enabling a smooth and engaging user experience. Through these examples, it becomes evident how marketing automation on HubSpot is not only a means of streamlining processes, but a powerful tool for creating deeper and more meaningful relationships with customers, effectively guiding their path to purchase. Inbound Marketing and Content Management HubSpot can be the centerpiece of an inbound marketing strategy and in content management, providing specific tools that enable companies to attract, engage and delight customers. Inbound marketing, as opposed to traditional strategies, is based on creating valuable content that draws customers to your brand in an organic, non-invasive way. One of the key tools offered by HubSpot in this context is its Content Management System (CMS). HubSpot’s CMS is designed specifically for the needs of inbound marketing, facilitating the creation, management and optimization of web content. With an intuitive editor and built-in SEO features, it enables companies to create search engine optimized web pages, blogs and landing pages, thereby increasing online visibility and attracting a wider audience. In addition, HubSpot offers powerful content analysis tools that allow you to monitor the performance of various pieces of content and understand which are the most effective in reaching and engaging target audiences. This data can then be used to further refine content strategies and improve conversion rates. Another key aspect of inbound marketing on HubSpot is its ability to personalize. Through audience segmentation and the use of behavioral data, HubSpot makes it possible to personalize the content shown to different user segments. This means that site visitors will see content relevant to their interests and previous interactions, increasing engagement and the likelihood of conversion. Finally, HubSpot closely integrates content management with its other capabilities, such as CRM and marketing automation, creating a cohesive ecosystem where every customer interaction is informed and enhanced by the content they have consumed. This holistic approach not only makes inbound marketing strategies more effective, but also ensures a better overall customer experience. HubSpot for Sales: Tools and Data Analysis HubSpot offers a wide range of sales toolsthat transform the way companies manage and optimize their sales processes. These tools are designed not only to automate and simplify daily tasks, but also to provide in-depth data and analysis that can have a significant impact on sales strategies.

This suite of tools includes features such as sales task automation, appointment scheduling, email tracking and the creation of customizable sales pipelines. These features save sales teams valuable time by automating repetitive processes and focusing on what matters most: building customer relationships and closing deals. A key aspect of HubSpot’s sales tools is their ability to provide detailed, real-time analytics. Through customizable dashboards, sales teams can get immediate insights into the performance of their activities, such as lead conversion rate, average length of sales cycles, and the effectiveness of different sales tactics. This data is crucial for making informed decisions and continuously optimizing sales strategies. In addition, tight integration with HubSpot’s CRM ensures that all customer data is centralized and easily accessible. This means that every interaction with a customer can be tailored to their needs and their history with your company, significantly improving the chances of success in sales negotiations. Data analysis plays a key role in optimizing sales strategies. For example, by analyzing customers’ buying patterns and collected feedback, sales teams can identify which products or services they find most interesting and adjust their strategies accordingly. In addition, predictive analytics can help identify which leads are most likely to convert into customers, allowing sales teams to focus their efforts more effectively. In conclusion, HubSpot not only provides the tools needed to manage sales efficiently, but also provides the analytics and data needed to thoroughly understand the market and customer behaviors, enabling companies to adapt and refine their sales strategies to maximize results. HubSpot for Customer Service HubSpot stands out in the customer service landscape by offering a suite of dedicated tools that transform and elevate customer service. These tools are designed to optimize customer interaction and improve the overall service experience, contributing significantly to customer loyalty and satisfaction.

This integration ensures that the support team always has access to all relevant information, such as purchase history and previous interactions, to provide personalized service and detailed information, further improving the quality of support. In addition, HubSpot provides detailed analysis of customer service performance, allowing key indicators such as response time, customer satisfaction, and frequency of service requests to be monitored. This data is essential for identifying areas for improvement, optimizing resources, and developing proactive strategies to increase customer satisfaction. In conclusion, HubSpot offers a comprehensive and integrated customer service solution, combining effective tools with detailed analytics to ensure a superior customer service experience. This not only helps solve customers’ problems efficiently, but also helps build stronger and longer-lasting relationships with them. Analytics and Reporting in HubSpot: Turning Data into Decisions.

These tools provide a detailed view of marketing, sales, and service performance, enabling evidence-based decision making. With HubSpot, you have access to customizable dashboards that provide key metrics on different aspects of your business. This includes analysis on web traffic, conversion rates, performance of email marketing campaigns, effectiveness of sales channels, and more.

Another key aspect of HubSpot’s reporting tools is the ability to track the entire customer journey. This means you can follow a customer from first contact to conversion and beyond, providing valuable insights into how to optimize touchpoints along the journey. This helps create more personalized customer experiences and increases the effectiveness of your marketing and sales strategies.

Whether you compose the email from scratch or use a pre-made sales or product messaging template, the extension enables you to reach out to your prospect at the right time with the right offer. Using your personal email address, you can send one-to-one emails to any contact to further build that sense of familiarity and trust. No one on the team can use your personal email except for you, so your prospects know they’re getting your full attention. Your reps can only send emails through their team email address which will be connected to the conversations inbox in Hubspot. That’s the email your reps will be using to connect with their respective prospects primarily. HubSpot email compose view Email and outbound from Sales CRM extension Schedule meetings With Hubspot, you create scheduling pages to share with your prospects so they can plan a meeting with you based on your calendar. It’s a great way to get potential leads to book product demos. It ensures that you’re never double-booked, so you can give your undivided attention to each prospect. To enable this feature you’ll have to connect your Google or Office 365 calendar to the meetings tool within your account settings. HubSpot schedule calendar view Easily schedule sales meetings from Sales CRM Set reminders As a seller, you may have a lot on your plate and you may lose track of time since there’s only so much you can do. With Hubspot, you can set reminders by date and time, and as the due date approaches for any task, scheduled meetings, calls, etc, the CRM will automatically send reminders. With this feature, your sales team is always on top of their performance and organized in their day-to-day tasks. Streamline your sales inquiries. Many clients and prospects come from different channels for sales inquiries.Engaging on every channel can be a challenge for your sales team. That’s why Hubspot offers a conversation inbox specifically for the sales team. When a prospect reaches out with a sales inquiry, you want the right sales rep to engage. Especially when your reps are assigned specific prospects, you want them to engage with their assigned prospect to ensure a seamless buyer experience. And to make that possible, Hubspot consolidates your inbox messages from your connected channels within its CRM. It creates a central location in Conversations for all your sales inquiries, and once you assign tickets for each conversation, your sales rep will respond to the right prospect at the right time. Your reps no longer need to hop from one channel to another when they get access to all the conversations in a single inbox. You don’t need your personal email to connect your inbox, you use your team email address to respond to all the messages, helping you streamline your sales inquiries. HubSpot channel view Centralize communication across channels Create chat flows Let’s say you’re getting a lot of traffic on your website but for some reason, you aren’t getting many leads. That’s because your traffic most probably wasn’t convinced enough to reach out to you. One often overlooked feature is a responsive chatflow between reps and prospects. Hubspot helps you add chat widgets to your website so that potential leads could be routed to your conversations inbox where your sales rep can reply. There are two options for you to pick from; live chat, and bot chatflow. Through bot chatflow, you can take your leads down a path of pre-set actions to narrow down their query and connect with an appropriate rep, all in real-time. HubSpot live chat view HubSpot live chat example HubSpot chat bot example HubSpot chatbot example Make phone calls Connect your contact details and start making phone calls to your prospects right from your Hubspot CRM. You can record these calls for future reference and enable your sales team to make calls without getting distracted on their cell phones. HubSpot dialer view HubSpot dialer Get Actionable Insights While you’re getting access to such exclusive features, HubSpot provides you with actionable insights on your sales performance. When you’re operating your entire sales efforts through Hubspot, it analyzes the impact of your sales efforts. On top of that, your Hubspot CRM tracks your website traffic in real-time to identify key visitors who may be potential customers. You get to view their professional profile such as the company they work for or their role in the company. This will allow the sales rep to establish some key talking points to better engage with the prospect. Not only are you able to better judge your sales progress, but you’re also enabling your sellers with key information to help them offer exactly what the prospect may need. HubSpot sales report view HubSpot sales pipeline reporting Hubspot Sales CRM: Turn-offs! Hubspot is great but it isn’t perfect. The reporting feature on hubspot’s CRM is not as detailed as a few of its competitors. You can view some information regarding the traffic, but due to lack of segmented traffic reports, its difficult to extract value. And as if that wasn’t a turn off enough, HubSpot fails to provide data on mobile users navigating your website. Given that much of the users are on their mobile phones, having data on such users is incredibly important. That’s why document tracking is also equally affected because Hubspot lacks in providing you with a variation of data insights that may help you better target your marketing and sales efforts. Content Camel offers better document tracking functionality, with powerful reporting that is leaps and bounds ahead of Hubspot. Find out How to Track Documents in Hubspot. Another turn-off about Hubspot is that it’s expensive. If your team is working on a tighter budget, or you just know your specific needs, Content Camel tools can help compliment your sales stack better than a full Hubspot suite of solutions. While Hubspot is offering a free version for a single user, as your business expands, you may need to upgrade your plan which will cost more for every single user you add. Not to forget that their contracts are rigid. You either sign up for a 6-month plan or an annual plan, and they charge you upfront. Hubspot Sales CRM Pricing. Another deal-breaker is that its templates are difficult to modify, and provide limited insights on all your sales efforts. Even when you have made templates, if you want to personalize them a little bit before pressing send - HubSpot may not be such a great fit for you.",HubSpot
Sales Marketing,"HubSpot - Good or Bad? 15 February 2024 HubSpot has become a SaaS behemoth since its inception in 2006, and for many, it’s the obvious choice for a CRM system. But what are the pros and cons of HubSpot? Certainly, HubSpot is not without its share of criticisms – we will take a look at what HubSpot actually does, why it is so popular, what HubSpot’s capabilities are beyond a CRM, and what the benefits and drawbacks are of using HubSpot. What is HubSpot? HubSpot is a CRM (customer relationship management) system that helps organisations manage their customers. A CRM is, at its most basic level, a database of customers and sales leads. Such a database allows businesses to communicate with their audience and potential customers effectively. Keeping all customer info and communications in one place avoids the risk of losing potential sales and leaking unsecured private data. CRMs like HubSpot collect and store detailed info on your customers, such as purchases and communications, and allow all members of a team to access customer details and history. HubSpot is a collection of six ‘hubs’ which include: Marketing Hub This is a collection of marketing tools and features which include lead generation, email marketing, automation, content creation, social media management and more. This enables businesses to develop and execute their marketing strategy. Sales Hub HubSpot’s Sales Hub offers sales tools such as contact management, email tracking and templates, document management, sales automation, reporting, and analytics. Sales Hub is helpful for businesses that prioritise building relationships with their customers and personalising their communications. Service Hub Service Hub provides customer service solutions that can be implemented by a customer service team. It provides features like ticketing, a shared inbox, live chat including AI-powered chatbots, email tracking, reporting and conversation routing, which assigns incoming chats and emails to an appropriate team member. This is suitable for a business with a large customer service team who must coordinate on offering a high standard of service. CMS Hub The CMS Hub, or Content Management System Hub gives businesses a platform through which they can create and optimise web content including landing pages, coding for added customisation, content creation e.g. blogs, email marketing and more. This hub also includes SEO, Google Search Console integration, plus other features that make it ideal for managing a business’s web presence. Operations Hub This hub allows businesses to streamline their operations and add automations to save time and resources. This includes features such as data syncing, programmable automation, customised chatbots, advanced reporting, integrations with other platforms, and more. This would be helpful for businesses who wish to align their sales and marketing efforts or access more insightful reports. Commerce Hub HubSpot’s Commerce Hub is designed for B2B businesses and offers tools for invoicing customers, providing quotes, taking payments, managing subscriptions, automated billing, reporting and more. Commerce Hub can also be integrated with accounting software such as Quickbooks and Xero. GET THE HANDBOOK The Digital Marketing Handbook is out now and includes over 250 pages of practical tips and advice on running all areas of your marketing campaigns from paid search and SEO to web design and email marketing. Buy the book on Amazon What Does HubSpot Actually Do? HubSpot is primarily a CRM system as briefly described above. HubSpot differs from some competitors by offering an ‘all-in-one’ system, as it includes many tools for marketing, sales, content management and customer service, broken down into the individual ‘hubs’, but all within one main program. Their marketing software package offers social media marketing tools as well as content management, revenue forecasting, data analytics, SEO tools, custom landing pages and more. There are plenty of other similar services that offer the same solutions, so what makes HubSpot so popular? Why Is HubSpot So Popular? The HubSpot CRM is well-known in the industry and for many, the obvious choice due to its free plan, helpful features like marketing tools and integrations with G Suite and Microsoft Office, and the HubSpot Academy which offers free courses in all aspects of CRM and digital marketing. A big draw of HubSpot is its centralisation of several products, which can streamline sales and marketing operations and help to ensure all teams are on the same page. When marketing campaigns are informed by CRM data, they can be more effective. The HubSpot marketing hub enables ads to be optimised more accurately, thus increasing click-throughs and conversions. This kind of informed marketing choice can boost ROI and help you get the most from your marketing budget. HubSpot is also big on community, with over 150 HubSpot User Groups (HUGs) around the world that enable HubSpot users to connect and share information and insights. HubSpot also hosts an annual conference in Boston, MA featuring hands-on workshops, new product announcements, demos, notable keynote speakers including Barack Obama, networking and more. HubSpot also provides several options for automation, saving valuable time, and its AI assistant can help with content generation as well as offer data-driven actionable insights for further growth. HubSpot is not shy of tooting its own horn and claims that its customers attract 114% more website traffic, acquire 129% more leads, and close 55% more deals after 1 year of using HubSpot. Such claims sound almost too good to be true – surely there must be some drawbacks to using HubSpot? Let’s take a look at some of the pros and cons of HubSpot. Helping organizations around the world My team and I help organizations all over the world to build and deliver effective marketing strategies that deliver results quickly and cost-effectively. FIND OUT MORE What Are The Pros And Cons Of HubSpot? Pro: Free Plan This is a big one. HubSpot offers one of the most comprehensive free plans for CRM solutions, and many features are included in this free package. A million contacts can be added to the HubSpot free plan which is pretty generous when compared to other similar offerings. The free version is often a stepping stone to a paid HubSpot plan, as it allows potential paid customers to try out the CRM and other features before committing to a paid plan. Con: No Customer Support on Free Plan While paid HubSpot plans offer customer service, the free version does not. Users are directed to the HubSpot community or their collection of articles and guides in place of customer service, which can be off-putting for some. Their database of articles and community forums is comprehensive, but sometimes it’s necessary to have a conversation with an expert about a specific issue. Pro: Conveniently Priced Bundles It is possible to bundle HubSpot’s services to make them more affordable. Each ‘hub’ can be purchased individually or together at a discounted rate. The CRM Suite Starter includes the Marketing Hub Starter, Sales Hub Starter, Service Hub Starter, and others, and starts at a convenient £18 per month (billed annually). HubSpot’s built-in scalability means that its packages can grow alongside the business, and users can add extra features and functionality as they require them. Con: Complicated Pricing Structure Once we advance past the free and basic HubSpot packages, it does start to get expensive and complicated pretty fast. The free version has limited functionality, but so do the paid plans too. That generous-sounding million contacts sounds good until it becomes apparent that to include those contacts in an email marketing campaign, there is an extra cost. The Starter plan only includes 1000 marketing contacts, which a lot of businesses will burn through quickly. Having 10,000 marketing contacts requires a hefty investment in the Enterprise plan which starts at £3000 per month – ouch! Businesses that begin with a Starter plan may find themselves having to upgrade not long after, and there is a significant price jump from £17 per month to an astounding £702 per month. There are other costs too – the Professional plan includes a ‘required, one-time Professional Onboarding for a fee of £2,600 which many customers would understandably baulk at. Join thousands of others Sign up to my marketing newsletter now to get the latest news, tips and advice every week Join the club Join the club Pro: Easy To Use, Intuitive Platform Many HubSpot customers sing the praises of the sleek, visually appealing interface and intuitive way of working. Less training is usually needed with HubSpot when compared to other CRMs. The drag-and-drop format of content creation tools like landing pages and emails makes life easy, and every activity is logged automatically. Being able to have multiple windows of HubSpot open at once, as well as easy filter and search functions make for a very convenient piece of kit indeed. Con: Poor Mobile App While having a mobile version of HubSpot is useful, their app leaves a lot to be desired, with many reporting frequent crashes, incoming calls automatically ending a current call, and overall limited functionality. With the need for many businesses to operate on the go and away from the desk, having a decent mobile app is essential for their needs, meaning that HubSpot may not be the best choice. Pro: Free Tools Another feature that HubSpot fans rave about is the huge amount of cool, free features and tools that it offers. Things like blog idea generation, templates for all kinds of content, browser extensions and an email tracker make using HubSpot fun and add to the overall value of the software. Con: Lots of Paid Add-Ons HubSpot’s free tools are great, but are they only providing fluff without actual functionality? Some features and functionalities are only available in the paid tiers, which many may find frustrating. Any business that wants to use HubSpot for its marketing capabilities may end up quickly spending a small fortune or turning to other platforms to fulfil its marketing needs, which may defeat the purpose of an integrated CRM platform. HubSpot is certainly popular and boasts a customer base of more than 194,000 businesses. It can be a hugely beneficial way of connecting all your marketing and sales activity together with end to end data and simple website setup. For B2B it is a strong play and more cost effective than some other leading marketing automation platforms. It isn’t as complete or sophisticated as Salesforce and it does have its weaknesses but overall it is a strong choice for B2B businesses in the SME space.

Check out these deal-breaking HubSpot CRM cons. 8 Drawbacks of the HubSpot Marketing and Sales Platform HubSpot vs EngageBay infographic While people have their priorities aligned with their business interests, most CRM-related decisions come down to a few basic aspects — pricing, functionality, ease of use, and flexibility of opting in and out. We’ve kept this blog post crisp and to the point — we’re only talking about the major pain points shared by HubSpot users here. What are the drawbacks of HubSpot? HubSpot gets expensive really quickly It has annual contracts – no early termination Not very effective when you don’t use it as an all-in-one tool HubSpot does not offer A/B testing on lower plans You have to pay for additional technical support, and the mandatory HubSpot onboarding service is expensive There are a lot of HubSpot alternatives with similar features but better pricing — ideal for small businesses 1. It gets expensive — quickly Let’s get this one out of the way since it’s so often a deal-breaker. At a glance, what HubSpot offers might look affordable. In fact, you get the CRM for free, plus a few additional tools. The HubSpot Starter plan is just $50 a month. However, if you’re a smaller business or otherwise working on a tighter budget, that’s where the good news ends. HubSpot Pricing HubSpot offers very limited features in its free version, so you’ll only be able to use it for the most basic things. Moreover, as your business grows, the prices you will need to pay will also rise, and quite steeply. For instance, their Starter plan, costing $50/month, only includes 1,000 contacts ($18/month for new customers). If you go beyond that, you’ll have to subscribe to their Professional plan, which will allow you to add another 1,000 contacts to your database, but it’ll set you back $800 per month. And, if you require more, you’ll have to get their Enterprise plan at $3,200 per month. Still, this will only offer you a maximum of 10,000 contacts. Hubspot cons: Hubspot pricing HubSpot CRM pricing As your number of contacts grows (which it certainly will, as your business expands), then you’ll also have to pay more. It would seem reasonable if not for the steep rise in the package price every time you decide to go for an upgrade. This might not be the most practical and affordable option for your business. In fact, it might not be doable at all. While it is very comprehensive and certainly impressive, HubSpot gets pricey and fast. If you go to any software reviews platforms, you’ll find many users unhappy with HubSpot pricing, like this: HubSpot-user-review HubSpot CRM review HubSpot’s 2024 pricing update explained HubSpot’s already expensive plans have undergone a major change in 2024, increasing the pricing further. While we won’t go into detail, this table shows the new changes: User requirement Previous pricing structure New pricing structure Users requiring view-only access to reports, records, and other data Included in the free plan Now offered in the free, View-Only seat Users requiring edit access to records and reports, email tracking, and other editable tasks Included in the free plan Now offered in the paid, Core seat Users requiring sales and service-specific features Dedicated Sales and Service seat Dedicated Sales and Service seat Want a more detailed explanation? Check out this blog post. Don’t have time to read so much? Watch what Megan Grant has to say about HubSpot’s many pros and cons: 2. Their contracts aren’t flexible While we’re on the topic of flexibility, here’s another one that many businesses frown on. Once you agree to a contract — like six or 12 months — you’re locked in, period. This is a major HubSpot con, especially for small businesses. There are no early cancellations or refunds. If you don’t use your maximum number of contacts or realize you don’t like a specific tool, it doesn’t matter. You will continue to be billed (even if it’s on a monthly basis) until you’ve fulfilled the entire contract cost. While this might be all right for businesses whose strategies and processes fit well with HubSpot’s features, this isn’t practical for businesses that are still in more of a testing period. If you decide to try out the platform and you realize that it’s not a good fit for your organization, you’ll still have to pay for it until your annual contract with HubSpot CRM ends. hubspot marketing terms of service It’s because nobody wants that pressure. Many (if not most) platforms are doing away with contracts completely. While we won’t argue that HubSpot is a pretty remarkable marketing automation tool, you better be 100% certain that you’re in love with it before you drop that kind of money. 3. It’s difficult to use NOT as an all-in-one tool If you want to experience HubSpot’s full benefits, running everything through its platform is the recommended course of action. This includes building your website in their own CMS. If you’ve already built your website in another CMS like, say, WordPress, and if you’re quite satisfied with it (which a lot of businesses are), you can imagine the extra work this would entail. The HubSpot CRM, inbound marketing automation, sales, and service tool is designed to be an all-in-one solution — and in terms of that specifically, it does a good job. However, and this is important, many businesses cannot run on one platform alone. If you’re only wanting to use a few select features within HubSpot, you’re likely better off going elsewhere. Plain and simple, this isn’t the best way to use HubSpot. Plus, you won’t be getting as much “bang for your buck.” There are more affordable alternatives. If your business requires customization, then HubSpot’s lack of flexibility may present a problem for you. It’s quite overwhelmingly an “all or nothing” tool. HubSpot-reviews 4. The templates are hard to modify Using HubSpot email templates can be a bit complex to modify without knowledge of CSS. This will be one more hurdle you have to jump if you don’t always have access to someone with this skill set. There are plenty of other alternatives offering a more user-friendly approach to building or editing email templates. This will save you time and money, and it puts you in the driver’s seat. That’s exactly what we need from a platform, especially when we’re spending money on it. Read also: HubSpot vs Insightly — Pricing, Functionality, Features & More 5. There’s no A/B testing on lower packages Split testing, or A/B testing, is an effective way to determine the best strategy for improving performance. It’s when you compare two different versions of something to determine which produces better results for your brand. For instance, you might split-test two Facebook ads with different images or two landing pages with different headings. Unfortunately, if you’re on HubSpot, you’ll have to purchase their Professional package, which starts at $800 per month, to take advantage of this feature. This can’t be stressed enough. You must be testing these variables if you want to (a) get the most out of the tools that you’re paying for, and (b) be successful with your digital marketing strategy and your overall online presence. 6. Reporting is limited For now, some of HubSpot’s reporting features aren’t as diverse or as detailed compared to a few of its competitors. An example is its lack of segmented traffic reports, which would have the ability to give you information about the percentage of various kinds of traffic visiting your pages. Furthermore, at present, it’s also unable to provide data on how mobile users navigate your page. This is incredibly important. Most people nowadays use their phones to browse websites. If you’re not able to study and analyze this audience, you’re missing something huge. These analytics and insights are going to be your best friend. They’re a must-have. If you’re not going to get them from using HubSpot CRM, a very large piece of the puzzle is missing. 7. You have to pay for additional technical support Implementing and using certain features within HubSpot might be straightforward. However, if your company requires continuous technical support, then you’re going to have to pay for it. HubSpot CRM charges for technical assistance whenever you need it. HubSpot negative review 8. There are plenty of HubSpot marketing and sales features with cheaper alternatives So much of this conversation is going to come down to the cost. Like we said in the very beginning, you have so many options. And here’s the bad news for the HubSpot CRM, sales, and marketing automation platforms. There are more affordable options that will essentially do the same thing. Let’s be honest: We’re all mindful of our budget. And why wouldn’t we be? Running a business isn’t cheap, and every dollar matters. Understandably, you want to know that your money is being put to good use. Here’s the thing. Some of HubSpot’s features have free or cheaper alternatives that are equal in functionality and quality. Some businesses prefer these other options over HubSpot CRM because it enables them to pick and choose what they like best from various platforms. As we mentioned earlier, because HubSpot is best utilized as an all-in-one tool, it’s much more difficult to ‘pick and choose’. It’s simply not in your best interests. Read also: 8 Surprisingly Awesome HubSpot Alternatives So, What’s the Best Choice for You? To be clear, the answer to this question is going to depend on what kind of business you’re operating. You should also consider your needs, goals, and pain points. We’d be lying if we said that there’s a one-size-fits-all solution. There isn’t. Every tool out there in the market has its share of both pros and cons. If you’re in need of a tool that will help you manage everything from start to finish, then yes — HubSpot CRM might be something to consider. However, this isn’t the case for many of us. If you realize the drawbacks of HubSpot CRM and you’re looking for a HubSpot alternative, here are just a few things that EngageBay is loved for. 1. More affordable pricing options Pay monthly.

While the platform does offer some features for free and delivers different package options for different-sized budgets, you'll need to invest more money in the system to get to its best features as your business grows. However, investing in a great platform is always better than wasting money on lower-cost resources that don't help you grow. 2. Template Customization Can Be Challenging While HubSpot offers free templates for emails and landing pages, they might not be exactly what fits your needs. Users with a lack of knowledge in skill sets, such as CSS, may find it challenging to customize the templates. However, a HubSpot Partner agency can help you build templates that fit your brand! 3. No Split Testing on Lower Packages Split testing is vital for businesses to fine-tune marketing and sales efforts. Varying two versions of marketing ads, email subject lines, landing pages, and other aspects of your inbound marketing plan to determine which one might be appropriate for your brand audience is essential. HubSpot offers these features only on higher-tiered packages, which might be limiting if your budget doesn't quite allow you to upgrade. 4. Using Advanced Features Might Require Help When getting into automated workflows and building custom websites, some businesses find that they don't have the team members in-house with the right experience to maximize those features. However, working with an expert agency like Geekly Media can help you maximize every feature in your HubSpot portal, including Service Hub and the HubSpot CMS! Red vector illustration banner recommended isolated on white background Why We Recommend HubSpot vs Salesforce We've said it before, but we'll say it again: we believe HubSpot is the ideal solution for small businesses ready to streamline sales and marketing efforts for growth. When comparing HubSpot and Salesforce, many businesses are finding that HubSpot offers distinct advantages that make it a better choice for their needs. HubSpot's user-friendly interface and straightforward implementation process make it more accessible to teams, allowing them to get started quickly. Moreover, HubSpot's pricing structure tends to be more budget-friendly, particularly for smaller businesses. The platform also offers an all-in-one solution with features like marketing automation, CRM, and sales tools integrated seamlessly. With HubSpot's emphasis on inbound marketing and content creation, businesses can build a more holistic and customer-centric approach to their marketing and sales efforts, making it a compelling choice in the CRM and marketing automation. We cannot stress enough that this platform is the best software to walk with you and grow your business. HubSpot's many features can drive your sales up with the right amount of effort! While no system is perfect, HubSpot brings together ease of use and the ideal set of features to optimize marketing strategies, operations, and sales. How Can HubSpot Help My Business? While an inbound marketing strategy is an excellent way to scale up your business, it can be demanding, especially concerning time and finding the best techniques to implement. Furthermore, having an internal team to work with sometimes is not enough. At other times you might even lack ideas on how to do digital marketing successfully. We believe HubSpot is the ultimate solution to optimize operations and marketing to help your business grow. The platform makes inbound marketing efforts easier while consolidating various functions through reliable software. The key role that HubSpot plays in boosting sales for your business is through inbound marketing. The HubSpot Ecosystem HubSpot is a habitat for digital marketing efforts, CRM, and sales management. Since excellent customer interactions are the basis of business success, HubSpot gives companies the solution to consolidate, automate, and track customer interactions through their CRM software. However, the platform does not stop there; with its five hubs (including HubSpot Operations Hub, Marketing Hub, and Sales Hub), HubSpot makes sales and marketing a breeze. As mentioned, the platform also offers insights that can help you with blogging and content marketing, social media marketing, and more.",HubSpot
Sales Marketing,"Ultimate List of HubSpot Pros and Cons Ultimate List of HubSpot Pros and Cons Life is full of difficult decisions. What should I be when I grow up? Where should I live? What marketing, sales, and service software should my business use? Ok, that last one might be a bit of a stretch, but if you’re reading this, it’s probably a dilemma you know well. As it becomes the business norm to make digital marketing, sales, and service initiatives entirely virtual, having a platform to organize and manage your activities, opportunities, and customers has never been more important. We may be a tad biased as a HubSpot partner agency, but HubSpot has long been our marketing and CRM platform of choice and how we teach our clients to track their progress with our business-growth framework, They Ask, You Answer. We’ve stuck with it for almost a decade now because of how much the platform consistently grows and improves over time. That being said, because the platform is always changing and improving, it is a lot to learn. So, we’ve done all the legwork for you! In this guide, we’ll break down not only the pros and cons of each of the major hubs of HubSpot (marketing, sales, service) and the CMS, but also the pros and cons of using all of the hubs together. Bookmark this page and use the links below to jump around as you continue to explore HubSpot. Table of Contents Chapter 1: HubSpot’s Growth Suite (and CRM) Chapter 2: Marketing Hub Chapter 3: Sales Hub Chapter 4: Service Hub Chapter 5: CMS Hub Chapter 6: Community & Support Chapter 7: Integrations But before we get started, how do you know if HubSpot is right for your business to begin with? Is HubSpot right for your business? If you asked this question in 2010, HubSpot was a simple marketing software for small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and the answer would be much more straightforward. In 2022, however, HubSpot is not only a robust digital marketing tool, but an entire platform of tools for your marketing, sales, and customer service teams. With that being said, if you’ve landed on this article, you’re likely either looking at getting started with the entire platform (what HubSpot calls the Growth Suite), or just one of the hubs. That’s exactly how we’ve broken down this guide. One very important note before we dive in: HubSpot’s subscription model is set up in tiers: Free, Starter, Professional, and Enterprise. Depending on what tier or hub you purchase, you will get access to different features and tools in the platform. In this guide, we will be looking at more general pros and cons that are less specific to individual tiers, but it’s important to note that if you’re looking at the Free and Starter tiers of any of the hubs, you’re going to have fairly limited functionality, and the pros and cons in this article may not apply. However, that doesn’t mean you should stop reading! One of the biggest pros of HubSpot is its ability to grow with you, so it’s important to familiarize yourself with all of the capabilities of the platform, even if you won’t be using them right now. Now that we’ve got that ironed out, let’s start with the pros and cons of using the entire Growth Suite (marketing, sales, and service hubs). Chapter 1: HubSpot’s Growth Suite (and CRM) The “Growth Suite” is how HubSpot refers to the ensemble of its three core hubs — Marketing, Sales, and Service — all of which are built onto the HubSpot CRM. (The CMS Hub, while still referred to as a “hub,” isn’t included here.) Each hub has its own unique pros and cons when used independently of the other hubs, but there are also a number of pros and cons of using the entire suite of hubs in tandem with one another. Because many users who start with a single hub end up growing into using the full Growth Suite (and you could certainly be one of them!), let’s start there. Pro: Keeps all of your marketing, sales, and customer service data in one place When you use the Growth Suite (marketing, sales, and service hubs all together), all of your marketing, sales, and customer service data live in one place — the CRM. The CRM (Customer Relationship Management, or to put it even more simply, the database) houses all of your data collected from any of the HubSpot tools. This may not seem like a big deal on the surface, but when you think about it… Imagine being able to pass a contact from marketing to sales to customer service without ever having to sync information with another system or duplicate work in two different places. Not only that, imagine being able to create a report that’s able to look at your customers across their entire customer journey — from the first time they landed on your website to their interactions with your support team. The end result? The ability to make decisions and improvements based on real data instead of gut feelings. Many marketing, sales, and service professionals spend hours and even days every year trying to pull, combine, and analyze data from disparate systems to report to their organization. With centralized customer data in the Growth Suite, you can do this type of reporting in minutes. And while easier reporting internally is a huge win, the real win here is how you can use all of this centralized data to improve your customer experience over time. Pro: An extensive App Marketplace to connect your other tools Every business has unique processes and needs, which means that even if you’re primarily using a single platform, you’ll likely have multiple other tools or platforms to run your marketing, sales, and customer service from start to finish. Thankfully, HubSpot has an entire ecosystem of integration partners that grows every day. The App Marketplace makes it easy to find what integrations are available, see what data and functionality are shared between systems, and quickly install the integration in your HubSpot portal. HubSpot-App-Marketplace For example, your marketing team may use Eventbrite to run online events. HubSpot isn’t an event marketing platform, but the Eventbrite integration takes just a couple of clicks to set up and will send all of your registrant and attendee information directly to your HubSpot portal. This is the next level of keeping all of your data in one place — since you’ll likely always have to use some other tools, the ability to easily connect them to HubSpot allows you to keep even more data in one place, and leverage it for all of your processes. Pro: HubSpot Academy Have you ever signed up for a new tool, only to realize you have no idea how to use it, no idea where to start, and no one to ask? With HubSpot, you’ll never have that problem. HubSpot Academy has dozens of courses and certifications that not only help you learn how to use each piece of the platform, but will also help you get better educated on marketing, sales, and customer service. They’ve got courses and lessons on things like inbound marketing, frictionless selling, customer journey mapping, and so much more, and they add and update content on a regular basis. You’ll likely never feel like you’re lost with nowhere to turn for help. Pro: Can grow with you One of my all-time favorite things about HubSpot is the ability for you to set up a free account and start playing on the platform immediately. While I hesitate to use the catchphrase “Try before you buy,” since with a free HubSpot portal you get very limited access to tools and functionality, you do have the opportunity to get into the tool and get a feel for how it works and what it will look like for you to be using it on a regular basis. This pro isn’t just about jumping into a free account to see if you like the platform, it’s about the ability for HubSpot to frictionlessly grow with you as your needs change. It’s scalable and only becomes more so with each update. Many companies will start with HubSpot Professional because it has all of the initial functionality they need to start automating their processes and doing detailed reporting on them. (The Free and Starter packages do not include workflow automation and custom reporting.) Eventually, when they run into limitations with complexity or team structure, those companies can quickly and easily upgrade any of their Hubs to Enterprise, which will simply un-gate additional tools and functionalities. This means your business can scale in many different ways without having to switch systems, which can take months to implement. If you purchase the Growth Suite (Marketing, Sales, and Service Hubs), you’ll get an automatic 25% off standalone prices, which is another pro altogether. Con: Not always the cheaper option So how much does it actually cost? Learn all about HubSpot’s pricing model here. And what about how much it costs compared to other competitors? Well, that’s where it gets tough. HubSpot has many different kinds of competitors depending on what you’re looking for. Are you looking for just marketing automation tools, or for an entire end-to-end marketing, sales, and service platform? For this reason, you’re going to have to do some due diligence on comparing pricing based on your business needs. While HubSpot’s flexible pricing structure is certainly a positive, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll be your cheapest option. If you’re using the Marketing Hub, you’ll need to pay for contacts you’re marketing to by the thousand, meaning you could end up paying additional hundreds and even thousands of dollars on top of your subscription level. For Sales and Service Hubs, you pay per user, which means if you have a large team, the cost can add up quickly. Again, this is a matter of doing your diligence to understand what HubSpot will cost you now, what it may cost you in the future, and what your other options are. For example, if you’re looking at a more enterprise-focused solution like Salesforce Pardot versus HubSpot’s Growth Suite, you’ll generally find HubSpot is cheaper or comparable cost-wise. However, if you’re comparing HubSpot’s Growth Suite pricing to using multiple more SMB-focused platforms (like Mailchimp, Hootsuite, etc), you’ll find HubSpot to be much more costly. Con: CRM not as “configurable” as other solutions One of the biggest reasons that companies will decide to go with CRMs like Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, or SugarCRM over HubSpot is the ability to custom-build their instance to perfectly document and track their current processes and match their needs. While HubSpot did release the Enterprise capability to create Custom Objects for the CRM, making it much more configurable than before, you are still limited in what functionality you can custom build into your portal (for example, you won’t be able to have a developer custom-build widgets into your portal). However, before you write this off entirely as a con for your business, consider whether or not custom building a CRM will be as effective as using one that is built to be user-friendly and easy to learn. Many companies spend months (and even years!) and thousands of dollars having custom CRMs built that perfectly capture every little piece of their process. The problem is, these systems often become so clunky, cumbersome, and outdated that no one actually uses them. The reason that HubSpot is less configurable is so that when updates and improvements are made to the platform, it doesn’t break all of your customizations, it adds to them. Also, since the release of Operations Hub in 2021, this has become even less of a con. With functionality like custom-coded workflow actions, data sync with other platforms and CRMs, and custom data sets, HubSpot now allows organizations to do more custom configuring of the HubSpot platform than ever before. Chapter 2: Marketing Hub HubSpot’s Marketing Hub has been around the longest and therefore has some of the most robust functionality of any of the platforms. From creating conversion paths with calls-to-action, landing pages, and forms, to automating your email campaigns and managing your social and ads accounts, Marketing Hub has a vast amount of tools to help you execute your digital marketing strategy. Pro: Collect data on all of your marketing efforts HubSpot’s Marketing Hub was built to collect data on just about everything you do as a marketer. You’ll be able to collect and use data on everything from who’s engaging with your emails and where your traffic is coming from to how pages on your website are performing and how many clicks your social media posts are getting. You can use all of that data to segment your contact database in a way that allows you to personalize reporting, contextualize all of your marketing campaigns, and refine your overall strategy. HubSpot-Marketing-Hub Pro: Powerful segmentation options Speaking of segmentation! You can use any data that’s being captured in your Marketing Hub portal to segment your contact database. Create things like lists of contacts who have been engaged with your site recently for your sales team to do outreach to, or use information you’re collecting on your web forms to drop contacts into different nurturing campaigns based on specific criteria they meet. Segmenting your database in this way allows you to create more personalized, contextual marketing campaigns without having to spend hours and hours pulling lists and manually creating segments. Check out this HubSpot Academy lesson on “Creating a Contact Management and Segmentation Strategy” for more on what you can do in HubSpot! Pro: Powerful automation One of the reasons HubSpot was created in the first place was to help marketers spend less time doing menial tasks and more time doing strategic things that matter. HubSpot’s Marketing Hub not only has a ton of little automation features across all of its tools (think: scheduling social media posts or getting a notification email when a form is submitted), but it also has an entire automation engine built on top of the CRM called Workflows. You can use Workflows to automate just about anything — from lead qualification and handoff to email nurturing campaigns and internal notifications. If you master the Workflows tool, you’ll be able to create an efficient marketing engine that allows you to automate the menial things so you can focus on the big stuff. I explain how to use them in detail in our free course Marketing Automation Mastery with HubSpot Workflows. Pro: Easy lead generation Most marketers looking into HubSpot’s Marketing Hub are looking to do one main thing: generate more leads. But how do you actually do this? With any marketing software or tool, you need a way to capture contact information (most critically email addresses) so you can market to those people. HubSpot makes that simple and easy with straightforward tools for capturing leads. Call-to-action buttons, drag-and-drop landing pages, and simple web forms that you can embed on any page of your website allow you to create end-to-end conversion paths. Pro: Straightforward drag-and-drop emails and landing pages Historically, one of the most frustrating parts about starting with a new marketing platform is the learning curve to be able to create new marketing assets. What if you don’t know how to code HTML emails? What if you don’t have a developer in-house? Do you have to hire someone to build those things for you? Not with Marketing Hub! HubSpot has an easy-to-use drag-and-drop builder for both creating emails and for creating landing pages. This functionality coupled with the easy-to-use form builder we just mentioned allows non-technical marketers to create entire conversion paths with automated follow-up in minutes without touching any code. HubSpot-Drag-and-Drop Con: Paying for contacts (even with the “marketing contacts” option) Earlier in this article, we mentioned pricing as one of the potential cons of HubSpot’s Growth Suite. That same con applies to the Marketing Hub individually, but there is also an additional piece of pricing that comes only with the Marketing Hub that can be a point of contention. Unlike the Sales and Service Hubs, a subscription to HubSpot’s Marketing Hub comes with a required Contacts subscription. This means you must pay per 1,000 additional contacts in your portal (each tier comes with a certain amount of “free” contacts to start). If you have a small database that you’re not looking to grow significantly, this likely won’t be an issue for you, but, if you have a high volume of contacts and you’re looking to continue generating more and more, you may find yourself paying thousands of extra dollars a year (or even a month!) just to store those contacts. HubSpot did release the “Marketing Contacts” option, which allows you to only pay for the contacts you are actively marketing to. Depending on your database setup, this could save you from paying for contacts that you aren’t actively engaging with. Con: Getting started takes time Wait, didn’t you just mention that it’s quick and easy to get started creating assets and conversion paths in HubSpot? Well, yes. It can be. If you know exactly what you want to do with Marketing Hub, it really is quick and easy to get up and running and start using the platform right away, but if you’re new to the inbound methodology and to marketing automation technology, it can be easy to get lost in all of the different functions that are available to you. Make sure you spend time taking HubSpot Academy’s Marketing Software Certification to understand what you can do in the platform and to start developing your strategy for how your business should be using it. Con: Limited “templates” to help you get started with automation When comparing HubSpot to other enterprise-level marketing tools, you may notice that most of HubSpot’s automation setup must be done completely from scratch. While there are a few templates in Workflows, they only cover fairly basic automation setups like assigning new web leads or setting a contact’s lifecycle stage. This means if you don’t have in-depth knowledge of how to use Workflows, you may find it difficult to build out automation properly. Chapter 3: Sales Hub HubSpot’s Sales Hub is a “powerful sales CRM software to help teams close more deals, deepen relationships, and manage their pipeline more effectively.” And of course, what sales team doesn’t want that? Individual sales reps can use the platform to manage their day-to-day activities with tools like deal pipelines, email templates, and detailed contact records, while sales managers can use the platform to do sales forecasting and create reports on how their teams are performing. Pro: User interface and usability This pro is by far the fan favorite of sales reps everywhere. When companies have custom-built or configured CRM platforms, there is often a lack of user-friendliness that keeps reps from going in and keeping information up-to-date. This lack of adoption inevitably leads to messy data and inaccurate reporting. The clean and simple design of HubSpot’s deal board, contact and deal records, and reporting dashboards makes it easy to work in the platform day-in and day-out, leading to higher rep adoption of the tools, and ultimately great data and even better reporting. HubSpot-Deals Once your admins have set up your deal pipelines and processes, any savvy rep can go in and get started right away, and even tech-averse reps find it easy to learn after just a little bit of training. Pro: Keep track of your entire sales process Just say no to spreadsheets! Too many sales teams (including IMPACT’s up until a few years ago) use spreadsheets to track all of their sales opportunities and do their revenue forecasting. With Sales Hub, you can set up your deal pipelines to keep track of the things that matter to you. HubSpot-Deal-Pipeline You can customize what information your sales reps have to input and when, and you can even set up automation when different activities happen around deals. With the custom report builder, you can then build dashboard reports that show how effective your sales process is, from the highest level (ie. total closed-won revenue) to the smallest detail (things like the conversion rate from stage to stage for each individual rep). This means your reps can spend less time updating spreadsheets, and more time working deals. Pro: Tools for improved individual efficiency Not only does Sales Hub have a great way to track and manage your deal pipeline, but it also has a whole bunch of tools that make sales reps’ day-to-day even easier. With tools like email templates, sales sequences, meeting schedulers, and task queues, individual reps can manage their entire workflow right within the platform. What’s more, sales managers are able to report on any sales activities happening on the rep level, meaning they can coach their reps based on real productivity data. Con: While the basic setup is easy, setting things up effectively can be much more difficult Just like with Marketing Hub, Sales Hub is easy to use, and many users can get started very quickly. However, in order to get your portal set up properly, you need to make sure you have your sales processes documented and have a clear understanding of how you want your pipelines and deal stages to be set up. There is a lot you can customize — you can create custom deal properties based on your unique sales process, you can configure each user’s permissions based on what information you want them to be able to see, and you can customize what each team or rep sees when looking at deal records. All of this opportunity for customization can also present an opportunity for chaos, so make sure you take the time to be strategic about your setup. Here’s a great place to start (even if you’re using the Free tools!). Chapter 4: Service Hub The newest of the three major hubs, the Service Hub is a set of tools for managing and tracking your entire customer service process. Ticket pipelines allow you to manage and track incoming inquiries in a single view, while the knowledge base and customer feedback surveys help you deliver an exceptional service experience. Pro: Easy-to-use ticketing pipelines for managing inquiries Just like the Sales Hub, HubSpot’s Service Hub has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for customer service reps to get up and running on the platform quickly. With customizable ticket pipelines and statuses, you can easily keep track of any customer service or support inquiries that come in, and then report out on any of that data. You’ll be able to see how many tickets each of your reps are closing for a given period of time, and do things like see which categories of tickets take the longest to resolve. Pro: Team inbox If your team uses a general support email address (i.e. support@company.com), you can connect that email to a HubSpot Inbox and manage all incoming inquiries as a team from one place. You can have those incoming inquiries automatically made into tickets and round-robined to your reps to evenly distribute the ticket load. What’s even better, if your team uses HubSpot’s live chat, those conversations will live in the same place, making it easy for your reps to manage all of their work in one place. All of this ultimately enables your team to deliver the best end-to-end customer experience they can, while using real data to continuously improve the process. Pro: Knowledge base to store support assets If you have a customer support team, they likely have a whole lot of resources they pull from when answering customer questions. Service Hub makes it quick and easy to set up a searchable Knowledge Base that your customers can reference before they submit a support ticket. This knowledge base can also be used in chatbots you set up. Knowledge-Base You’ll then be able to see what users are searching for and if they’re finding your articles helpful, helping you to prioritize which content to create and update as you go. Pro: Follow up on your support processes with surveys One way to know how effective your customer service team is this: look at speed and volume — how many tickets reps are closing and how fast that’s happening. But that’s only helpful if you know that, when a ticket is closed, the customer’s problems are actually getting solved in the best way possible and they have no further questions. A way to know how happy your customers are is that you have more and more deals closing and low churn, but that’s only helpful if you know that your customers are so happy they would refer their friends to you or stick around. Enter: feedback surveys. Service Hub allows you to send CSAT, NPS, and CES surveys to your customers to get feedback on all different parts of the customer experience. CSAT-Survey (CSAT Survey Example) No more assuming customers are happy or satisfied. Now you can not only know with real data, but also act on it! Con: Survey functionality is currently limited While You can do CES, NPS, or CSAT surveys and customize the wording, your flexibility with surveys pretty much stops there right now. In November 2020, there was a public beta for custom feedback surveys, but there are still some limitations. Con: Limited features Service Hub was released to the public in May of 2018. Because it’s the newest of the three main Hubs, that also means it’s the most basic. If you need a more sophisticated customer service platform with robust features like a completely customizable knowledge base and survey tool, you’ll either need to look at a tool like Zendesk, or wait a year or two. Service Hub has already come a long way in terms of functionality since it was released, and there are more updates on the horizon. Chapter 5: CMS (Website) Hub The CMS (content management system) Hub is what you’ll need if you want to build and host your entire website on HubSpot. There are two tiers — professional and enterprise. CMS Hub Professional gives you everything you need to build a standard website (think: nicely designed pages with text and images only). CMS Hub Enterprise gives you added functionality to be able to build things like web app experiences, host additional brand domains, and have more control over governance. Pro: Developer-friendly and marketer-friendly In 2020, HubSpot released the new-and-improved CMS Hub, and the best thing about it? It’s made HubSpot’s CMS a unique combination of both robust developer features and a simple front-end experience for marketers. When used to its fullest, developers can create sophisticated websites that blur the lines between website and web app, while at the same time making it easy for marketers to create and edit any page. This means companies can save time and money by having their in-house teams make updates to website pages rather than needing developer resources for every single update. Plus, marketers can quickly execute campaigns that include new website pages without needing any outside resources. Pro: Your website and your CRM are beautifully intertwined When you’re using HubSpot’s Marketing Hub, having your site hosted on HubSpot and managed in your HubSpot portal makes life a lot easier. You don’t need plugins or other tools to start capturing leads and engaging with them, it’s all built into the platform. With HubSpot’s tracking capabilities, you can see how leads are interacting with your site, what pages they’ve viewed, and other actions they’ve taken. You can then optimize pages and the journey overall or even create personalized website experiences by using the contact data housed in the CRM in conjunction with the CMS’ dynamic content functionality. Considering whether to put your website on HubSpot or WordPress? Check out this detailed comparison. Con: Cost With so many free website builders out there, the sticker shock for HubSpot is real. With plans starting at $240 per month, building and hosting your website on HubSpot is certainly an investment. While no robust website host will ever be free (just because WordPress is technically free doesn’t mean the cost of plugins and other tools needed won’t add up!), you should look at using CMS Hub as a marketing and sales investment (after all, your website is your best salesperson!). Websites are no longer just a virtual storefront, they’re what get your buyers 70% of the way through the buying decision before talking to one of your salespeople. When looked at in this way, making an ongoing financial investment in a great website platform just makes sense. Chapter 6: Community and Support With every major software implementation comes a unique set of challenges and decisions to make. So while it’s helpful to know the pros and cons that come with the software itself, there are also bigger-picture pros and cons that come with implementing and using tools for the long term. That’s where community and support come in. To be successful with any major software investment, you’re going to need to leverage both the support that the platform provides, as well as other members of the user community to troubleshoot issues that come up and generate ideas around how to most effectively use the tool. Pro: HubSpot Academy We’ve talked about this, but it’s worth repeating here. HubSpot Academy is just downright awesome and is a huge benefit of using the tool. It’s also worth noting that while HubSpot Academy has a large number of educational resources you can consume without being a HubSpot user, it also has an extensive Knowledge Base for users that has documentation around every tool and functionality. It’s Google for HubSpot, and it’s awesome. Pro: HubSpot Community Forum While HubSpot Academy’s resources are awesome, they are meant to be general and apply to as many people as possible. The more you use HubSpot, however, the more you’ll realize there are a million different ways you can use the platform, and everyone that uses it likely does things slightly differently. HubSpot’s Community Forum has an endless list of user questions, feature requests, and solutions from HubSpot employees and partners. If you’ve got a question about whether or not you can do something in HubSpot, the Community Forum is your place to go. Oftentimes, you’ll find that someone else has had the exact same or a similar question, and there may already be a solution ready for you. Pro: An extensive partner agency network While HubSpot’s own support resources are great, they know there’s only so much they can do for their thousands and thousands of customers. That’s why they have a network of agency partners that work with HubSpot customers to find success with the platform. (Spoiler alert: we’re one!) If you don’t have the in-house resources to execute your marketing, sales, customer service, and/or website strategies, partner agencies can help in a variety of ways, from training and education to implementation. Pro: Customer success managers and teams (for pro and higher) If you’re using a HubSpot Professional or Enterprise product, you’ll be assigned to either a Customer Success Manager or Customer Success Team at HubSpot that will stay connected with you on an ongoing basis to make sure you’re getting the most out of your investment. Having this connection inside the proverbial orange walls means you’ll be able to get support directly from the source if you run into an issue that you just can’t solve. This resource adds an additional layer of accountability to make sure you continue pushing toward your goals, rather than just trying to make sure you keep paying for the platform. Con: High support volume can increase wait times If you’re working on a high-priority task in HubSpot, and need some additional help from HubSpot Support, it can be hit or miss how quickly you’ll get help based on how much volume there is at your time of inquiry. This can be frustrating if it keeps you from doing things like launching an email campaign on time. While many times you can get an answer from Support right away, don’t assume you always will be. Chapter 7: Integrations As we’ve mentioned previously, HubSpot does a lot, but it doesn’t do everything. What’s important is not that it does every single possible business function, but that it can talk to other tools you’re using to keep your processes running smoothly. That’s where integrations come in. Pro: HubSpot has hundreds of apps in its ecosystem Over the last several years, HubSpot has opened up its API in a way that has allowed app developers to build easy-to-use integrations between HubSpot and other tools. As mentioned previously, there are hundreds of integrations in the App Marketplace that can be set up in just a few clicks. Integrating popular tools like Gmail, Outlook, Eventbrite, Slack, Zoom, Shopify, and SurveyMonkey is quick and easy, and there are more apps being added to the marketplace every day. Con: Custom integrations can come at a price The App Marketplace is great, but what if the tool I want to integrate with HubSpot isn’t in the App Marketplace? Can I still integrate them? The answer is yes, you can, but it’ll have to be a custom-built integration, and these integrations can come at a high price and be cumbersome to manage and keep up-to-date.

I ended up going into wireframes constantly to make simple layout changes."" (Source: Software Advice) User Review 2: ""The downside is, of course, the price. You need to balance the benefits of all the automation that frees up your time versus coding it all yourself. However, not everyone needs an Enterprise level subscription and the different pricing tiers should help most smaller businesses with their needs without breaking the bank."" (Source: G2) User Review 3: ""The horror is the price of the platform as it might not seem a lot but it increases a lot – Very expensive Biggest flaw of HubSpot."" (Source: Gartner) 3. Takes Time to Learn: While the user experience with HubSpot is one of its strongest benefits, the large number of features and functionality require time to learn. Some users find that it takes time for their marketing teams to fully grasp and utilize its potential. Users report HubSpot takes time to learn Review 1: ""Clearly, the least about any solution implementation in a Startup or Company is the implementation phase. Is not easy to adapt to changes and of course adapting all the organization to a new platform takes time. The best way to do this phase in an organized manner is definitely a big issue in our path to success. We have to be organized, patient, and clear to the path we will be transiting. All members of the organization must be able to add value in these phases.""(Source: Software Advice) Review 2: ""The Hubspot Marketing Hub is a great tool, but for some of our more traditional team members, adoption has been slow – and they struggle with using all of the valuable tools on this platform. Setting up some of the workflows and finding some of the reporting has been tricky even for me, so I can see how someone less tech-savvy could be struggling with some of the functionality and adoption."" (Source: G2) User Review 3: ""It can be intimidating at first due to the many personalization items and a few confusing elements like the inbox. Also launching automation requires a specific skill set that cannot be underestimated."" (Source: Gartner) How Does HubSpot Marketing Hub Compare with Other Leading Marketing Automation Platforms?

Sales Marketing,"Pros and Cons of HubSpot: Choosing the Right Tool Spencer Flaherty November 25, 2019 6 Min Read Pros and Cons of HubSpot: Choosing the Right Tool What is HubSpot? If you’re reading this blog, you’ve already heard of HubSpot. But are you familiar with everything it has to offer? HubSpot is a cloud-based, software-as-a-service company that offers a full stack of marketing, sales, and service software for your business. Based out of Boston, HubSpot has continued to grow over the last few years after going public in mid-2014. This has allowed HubSpot to expand its service offerings - keeping its customers, and their customers, as the main focus. In this blog, we're diving into some HubSpot pros and cons specific to the many tools that HubSpot offers. We hope it helps you determine if HubSpot is a good fit for your eCommerce business! HubSpot Tools HubSpot can help B2B and B2C marketing strategies with three main tools: Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, and Service Hub. Each can be used separately, but they are most powerful when used together. HubSpot also offers a CRM, which is completely free with any package. The Marketing Hub offers email marketing, marketing automation through workflows, social media monitoring and posting, analytics tracking and much more. The Sales Hub allows users to connect one-on-one with prospects through the use of sequences, meetings, playbooks and pipeline management. HubSpot’s most recent major roll-out is the Service Hub, which allows for ticketing support and shared inboxes within the tool. The Evolution of Inbound Marketing Much has changed since HubSpot was founded in 2005. The tool first featured only the Marketing Hub, which has since remained its flagship product. At this time, internet marketing was in its infancy. However, a fundamental shift began occurring in the industry. Sales teams were growing frustrated calling on cold leads. Marketing teams were growing frustrated by sending out marketing messaging into a black hole. In 2010, co-founders Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Sha published a book called Inbound Marketing, about - you guessed it - how to grow your business through the Inbound Marketing methodology. HubSpot’s new methodology for marketing strategies solved these frustrations. The inbound marketing methodology focuses on attracting the right visitors, converting them into leads, closing deals to make them customers and continuing to delight their customers. HubSpot shifted the focus from the traditional sales funnel to a new concept: the flywheel. The flywheel keeps the customer at the center of all activity, where the funnel has the customers as an afterthought. All of HubSpot’s products align to each area of the flywheel and connect all teams to work together to serve the customer - Marketing, Sales, and with the addition of the Service Hub, Customer Service. Who is a Good Fit for HubSpot? Marketing automation software is not one-size fits all. The needs of your business may be different than those of your competitor’s based on a variety of things like team size, business size and overall strategy. HubSpot works best for growing, mid-market and Enterprise businesses that are looking to increase the amount of leads they generate online. Content creation and thoughtfully-mapped automation based around your business's specific user personas are at the core of the inbound marketing methodology. If you do not have the time, resources, or team to dedicate to creating fresh content, then this tool may not be for you. While HubSpot does require maintenance and strategy, it will pay dividends if you are willing to put in the time. HubSpot Pros and Cons Like any other software or product out there, there are pros and cons of HubSpot. We're outlining them below to help you determine if HubSpot is a great fit for your eCommerce business. Marketing Tools Pro - Marketing automation is arguably HubSpot’s most powerful tool. With HubSpot’s automation, you can give a team of 3 the power of a team of 15. Creating a more efficient marketing machine with less effort is the core of HubSpot’s practice. Con - Setting up marketing automation with HubSpot is an investment. A simple newsletter sign-up auto-responder can be done in 20 minutes, but a proper marketing plan for nurturing leads takes more time and energy to set up. Website CMS Pro - In 2018, HubSpot released their CMS product, which could be purchased alone or as an add-on to any Hub tier. The CMS product is great for small sites that want to leverage the power of personalization in an easy-to-use and intuitive content management platform. If you’re already using HubSpot tools, it’s a no-brainer to consider. Con - The HubSpot CMS offers everything you need for a basic site out of the box, including a free SSL authentication. However, the CMS only supports the same languages that the HubSpot CRM supports - which can create complexities for multinational businesses. Service Hub Pro - Did you know that 60% of consumers have stopped doing business with a brand because of a poor customer service experience? The addition of the Service Hub to the HubSpot tech stack has been the biggest roll out since HubSpot’s inception. This tool has made it easier than ever for eCommerce-focused businesses to incorporate all aspects of marketing strategy into HubSpot. The Service Hub includes a Help Desk with ticketing, shared inboxes so teams can tag-team support and a chat bot to automate help and route tickets. Best of all, this activity is stored in contact records, which gives full context of your customer’s relationship with your business. Con - If you have complex needs for your Customer Service team, such as RMAs, you may need to look into custom integrations for Service Hub or consider alternate options. Sales & CRM Pro - There are many options out there to empower your sales team, including Salesforce vs HubSpot. HubSpot is the one tool that gives you the full picture of your customer’s interaction with your website, marketing materials and sales team. Contact records in HubSpot hold all information about a customer’s interaction in one spot. This allows for quick pick up from one sales person to another and then from salesperson to customer service rep. The CRM feature is also free to start, which is a huge added bonus. Con - If you’re operating with an enterprise team with complex team structures and many team members, HubSpot Sales Hub may not be the right tool for you. Although it can support businesses of any revenue size, businesses may experience difficulty after expanding to include a large number of staff on their sales teams. Integrations Pro - With over 800 integration options available in the marketplace, you can likely find something to fill almost any need when connecting HubSpot with your business. Salesforce, CallRail, Facebook Ads and Databox top the list, just to name a few. An Open API also allows for developers to build custom integrations. Con - If you require a large amount of integrations, especially paid ones, costs can add up. However, HubSpot’s baseline functionality is robust enough, so this is not a frequent issue. eCommerce Pro - Integrating with your eCommerce platform and HubSpot takes connecting with your customers to the next level. By linking HubSpot with your eCommerce platform, you can take advantage of more-flexible abandoned cart emails, capture more leads and service your customers by answering their questions all in one place. Con - eCommerce implementations with HubSpot typically require an integration. Fortunately, we’ve developed integrations for BigCommerce, HubSpot and Shopify that can help you sync order and customer data into your CRM. Support Pro - HubSpot’s support is top notch. Pro plans and above receive priority phone support in addition to the chat and email support available on the website. Response times average about 1 business day, but help is often offered immediately on chat. HubSpot also does a phenomenal job of owning and updating their knowledge base. Try searching for just about any “How to do XYZ in HubSpot”, and the top result will be a relevant, helpful article from HubSpot. Con - Honestly, we’re hard-pressed to find cons with HubSpot’s support. If your customization needs are heavy, it may take a little while to get routed to the right person that can help solve your problem. However overall, we give HubSpot support and responsiveness a 9.5/10. Cost Pro - Weighing the costs of your CRM tools might be your biggest influence when making a decision. HubSpot has several pricing structures based on the tier you choose. As always, the base Hubspot CRM is free. They also offer packages for any size business and budget. Packages start at $50 per month and go up to $2,400 per month for Enterprise level. Your incremental costs are based on the number of contacts you keep in your system. The Sales Hub pricing has an additional factor of price per seat, on top of a base price. The Pro level includes 5 seats, and you can pay incrementally for additional seats needed Con - If you have a large sales team, the incremental cost per seat of each Sales Hub user can add up. Perform a cost analysis before making a decision to see where HubSpot pricing falls in line with other products while accounting for scaling your team’s growth. Reporting Pro - If you’re wondering how your customers are interacting with your email communication, HubSpot provides crystal clear reporting on that front. Every email records sends, engagement, bounce rates, scan data and click through rates. You can attach several emails to a specific campaign, along with landing pages, blogs, CTAs, etc. to track overall engagement with your targeted marketing efforts. Con - HubSpot continues to roll out improvements to their reporting tool, there is still room to grow. To cover our bases, we always simultaneously maintain Google Analytics accounts to verify client performance. HubSpot Success Stories HubSpot isn’t just for B2B lead generation businesses. As we already mentioned, HubSpot has robust resources for eCommerce brands looking to jump into inbound marketing. Cutter & Buck is an American sportswear company based out of Seattle, WA (and a Groove Commerce client). After struggling with Pardot email marketing, they were looking for a more intuitive and powerful solution to meet their needs. Their team aligned its HubSpot Marketing Hub roll out with a new site launch, and was able to make tremendous leaps in its marketing efforts. After increasing email efforts and configuring automation, sessions from email increased 33% YoY. Furthermore, their eCommerce conversion rate increased 45%, revenue increased 25% and the number of transactions increased 22% by implementing HubSpot and BigCommerce. Conclusion If you’re looking to implement an inbound marketing strategy for your business by using an all-in-one tool, then we highly suggest taking HubSpot for a test drive. If you want to evaluate HubSpot against its competitors, such as HubSpot vs Mailchimp or HubSpot vs Marketo, we recommend conducting research on your options before investing in a platform.

Sales Marketing,"HubSpot For Your Sales And Marketing Alignment TransFunnel Consulting TransFunnel Consulting May 25, 2023 Break the ice with HubSpot sales and marketing alignment and automation What’s the worst that can happen to a business when it comes to achieving its growth objectives? The answer is – sales and marketing do not work in tandem, which can mean they are working at cross-purposes with one another or in silos. McKinsey says that most businesses do not grow and between 2010 and 2019, only 1 in eight businesses achieved 10% growth. As a business, you need to make a concerted effort to reduce all barriers that impact growth and misalignment between marketing and sales is one of them. Importance of marketing and sales team working in alignment There is a direct link between increased revenue and better marketing and sales alignment. This is because both teams do not work exclusively with each other and use each other’s strengths to ensure targeted messaging, achieve better quality leads, improve conversion rates and shorten the sales cycle. The buying behaviour of both B2B and B2C customers is not set in stone. It constantly evolves and the marketing and sales strategies should evolve accordingly. It, therefore, becomes imperative that marketing and sales walk in step, with marketing enabling sales at each stage of the sales cycle to ensure leads are targeted in a personalised manner. The focus should be on creating the right story while nurturing deals which resonate with the lead/prospect and encourage purchase action. This can only happen with marketing and sales teams working well together. Markers of marketing and sales non-alignment Before you start acting on the misalignment or non-alignment of your sales marketing teams, it is essential to identify the signs that point to both teams not being on the same page. Let’s take a closer look at what these are: MQL is King If your marketing team evaluates its performance solely on the number of Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) it can achieve in a month, then there is an apparent misalignment with sales. According to Salesforce, only 13% of MQLs convert into Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs) and 6% turn into deals. The underlying challenge is that sales must convert leads into paying customers. So, it makes sense that your MQLs are such that they have a better chance of transforming into a Sales Qualified Lead, which can then translate into an opportunity, ending in a closed sale. If this doesn’t happen, low-quality leads are passed to sales and they find it near impossible to achieve favourable outcomes on those leads. This results in a clash between two teams critical of driving business growth. Zero synergy Have you been on those sales-marketing sync calls, realising there is no sync between the two teams? The call typically ends sourly, with team members accusing each other of not doing their jobs well. This happens because sync calls are the only time the teams interact with one another and key team members have little clarity on what the other side wants to achieve and why it wants to go on a specific path instead of another. When this happens, sales messaging does not appear like a natural progression of marketing messaging. Also, both departments are on the same page regarding lead scoring, which defines lead quality. There is no discussion on how a lead must be scored and how it needs to progress through the funnel, the kind of messaging it must be targeted with, and the nurturing process taking cognisance of the revenue from the lead. It’s a competition Are you trying to go one up over the sales or marketing teams? Are you always trying to show that the quality of the leads is bad or sales don’t know their job, impacting deal close rates? The situation sometimes gets so bad that the sales team starts taking its own campaign and content decisions, which can appear to conflict with the marketing campaigns. E.g., sales might execute a campaign for cold leads that sales had interacted with previously but have been cold for quite a while. Marketing might feel that such cold leads deserve to be woken up with personalised messaging under their purview, resulting in a conflict that can best be avoided. Fixing the problem There are no quick-fix solutions to fixing the sales and marketing problem and getting the teams to work seamlessly with one another. But it all begins with communication and listening to one another. Marketers must understand that their job at its core is not just branding but about becoming a key facilitator of achieving revenue targets; this means they should be able to pass on the highest quality leads to sales and make sure their campaigns can accelerate sales pipelines. Sales enablement is a crucial aspect of marketing; therefore, continuous meaningful interaction is the way forward. Moreover, you should be able to identify clear, measurable outcomes that both departments can get behind. Typically, sales are under tremendous pressure to achieve their targets and marketers need to get an idea of these targets and work with the sales team to formulate targeted campaigns that can help achieve sales goals. Also, it is imperative that both functions work with clean data, monitor results from campaigns, keep track of campaign iterations and ensure they stay on top of each other’s activities but do not interfere. This helps maintain much-needed transparency. How does HubSpot help? HubSpot is a platform that can be an ideal unifier for your sales and marketing efforts. It has two major components, the marketing hub and the sales hub: HubSpot helps you keep track of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) through dashboards that both sales and marketing can access. Users from marketing and sales are kept updated about campaign progress and results from the campaigns, which are updated in real-time. This ensures alignment of the parameters that matter to both sales and marketing and to the organisations as a whole. With HubSpot, the marketing content calendar and campaigns can be aligned with the revenue targets (dependent on sales). This tells the sales team that the marketing messaging is aligned with the sales outreach processes and the results can be monitored through the platform. Another critical area where HubSpot helps is by aligning lifecycle stages (marketing) and deal stages (sales). By using ‘Lead Status’, a customisable property within HubSpot CRM, marketing and sales can stay on top of any lead in the buying process, whether new, open, in-progress, open deal or unqualified. In addition, the status of the lead can be customised in a manner that makes more sense for both marketing and sales, e.g., ‘hot’, ‘warm’, ‘priority’, ‘low priority’ and so on. For example, if sales mark the lead as a top priority, marketing automatically knows the contact must be moved out of a nurturing campaign. This results in closer alignment. With HubSpot sales and marketing, you have access to unified data that can act as a single source of truth to analyse the success or failure of campaigns and show the way forward. There is scope for subjective arguments as data-driven analysis helps deliver objective conclusions. The alignment will be far smoother with sales and marketing using accurate data. The idea behind using HubSpot for marketing and sales is to automate repetitive tasks, access and use accurate data to gain outcomes-focused insights and ensure that all marketing and sales activities work perfectly. Therefore, your focus must be to maximise the potential of this CRM tool to achieve the alignment you need. The benefits of HubSpot marketing and sales Hub Have you heard about smarketing? It is a process that closely aligns sales with marketing, leveraging an integrated approach to achieve business goals. With HubSpot, you are giving your marketing and sales teams the benefits of marketing and sales hubs to empower smarketing. You can access an advanced toolset that helps you collaborate better, thus reducing internal conflict and getting sales and marketing on the same page to achieve business goals using a consolidated sales and marketing strategy.

Focused automation helps you create and execute automated outreach strategies through the various lifecycle and deal stages; this improves efficiency, productivity and accelerates go-to-market. Improved team unity as they get behind a single source of truth delivered through marketing and sales hubs, which ensures they can stay on top of the needs of customers. Real-time monitoring or marketing strategies to measure the ROI of all sales and marketing activities; getting a ringside view of success and failures helps iterate strategy on the go.

Sales Marketing,"Our thoughts on Hubspot Hubspot are an extremely popular, yet massively over-priced, marketing automation tool aimed at small businesses. In our recent analysis of the marketing automation industry, we found that Hubspot own a 41.6% share of the small business automation software market, positioning them ahead of Keap as the market leaders. Despite having an exceptionally well-designed product that has proven its value to over 30,000 small businesses, we generally would not recommend Hubspot. Why? Because there are even better alternatives (e.g. ActiveCampaign ) that cost 20x less. While Hubspot’s starting price of $200/month may not seem like much, they’re notorious for price creep and lock-in contracts. While you may start by paying $200/mo, this can quickly end up in the thousands as you require additional contacts and features. For comparison, where Hubspot charge $2,400/mo for 10k contacts (plus $5,000 for onboarding), Ontraport charge only $297/mo for 25k contacts (with no onboarding fee), and Hubspot charge just $70/mo for 10k contacts. Ultimately, whether or not Hubspot is going to be right for you business depends on the size of your list today, and where you expect it to be in 1, 3, and 5 years time. Hubspot is one of the best designed and best marketed marketing automation tools, which explains why they have the highest number of customers among all marketing automation tools. Hubspot Review Summary Hubspot is a well known and well regarded marketing automation tool in the market Prices scale fast as you add on more features to the starting set You may find it worth it to utilise their huge feature set and mature integration HubSpot is best for: HubSpot is ideal for medium-sized B2B businesses and agencies that need a centralized CRM & marketing platform with in-depth reporting. Hubspot’s Screenshots Hubspot’s Pricing With a lot of features and market renown, Hubspot offers a lot of flexibility and you can have confidence in your marketing automations. However this comes at a hefty price tag, with prices starting at $200/mo. Free from $0 /mo Unlimited free trial Starter from $45 /mo Free start Professional from $800 /mo Free start Enterprise from $3200 /mo Free start And as to find out which plan is right for you, check out our full Hubspot pricing breakdown. Hubspot’s Pros and Cons Hubspot is easy to use, and well regarded in the market - but beware if you have a limited budget. Pros The platform is easy to use: Hubspot have a beautifully designed product. Given the complexity of marketing automation software, they have done a great job of making it intuitive for small business owners with little or no coding ability. 7-day free trial: Most marketing automation tools do a pretty bad job of mitigating the customer’s up-front risk (high setup fees, no free trials, and long contracts). While Hubspot do require high setup fees and a contract, they are one of the only tools to offer a free trial. Educating their users: Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Hubspot is the extent to which they invest in educating their customers. Their blog provides an exceptional place for business owners to learn about online marketing. A place for all your tools: Hubspot is convenient in that it has everything in one place. While you could get 99% of Hubspot’s functionality for free (or cheap) elsewhere, it’s handy having it all in one place. Cons Requires a 12-month contract: Hubspot contracts are billed annually by default. Ultimately, marketing automation is something that you’re likely to use for many years, so this is not too big an issue. However, it would be preferable to have a rolling month-on-month contract. No A/B testing in their basic or PRO package: If you want to run split tests, you’re going to have to upgrade to their $2,400/month package. Given that A/B testing is one of their quickest and most effective ways to improve the performance of online campaigns, it seems odd that they wouldn’t offer this at lower levels to help small businesses generate better results (and additional revenue). Very steep price creep: While Hubspot do have a $200/month package, marketing automation and CRM integration are only offered at their $800/month package, which includes only 1,000 contacts. As your requirements and contacts grow, so does this cost (quite rapidly). Most tools offered by Hubspot are free elsewhere: Hubspot offers a well-designed set of tools, but there aren’t any silver bullets in there that couldn’t be found elsewhere for free or cheap. Technical support is paid: Implementing Hubspot is fairly straight-forward, but if you do require ongoing technical support, you’ll have to pay for it. Hubspot’s Features Overview Whilst not the biggest list on the market, Hubspot does offer a comprehensive list of feaures. Hubspot visual marketing automation: The visual editor works in real time to cover the most simple to the most complex of your customer journeys. Salesforce Integration: Strong two-way sync means you can keep all your data uptodate.

With the new pricing, there\'s no cost for contacts as well. That\'s probably why it owns 40+% of the SME market. The martech tools are spot on. One of the issues is that it\'s too easy to edit, needs good practices to setup to stop it from becoming a frankensystem. Most critical review R Randall Tinfow Managing Director Hubspot disappointment 2.5 of 5 20/02/2019 We are in Hubspot's startup program, with a discounted rate of about $650/month. The surprise is that the pages constructed using their templates are not acceptable. There are CSS errors and presentation problems that require us to pull engineers out of their normal workflow (billed at $150-225/hour) and get them to work on the spaghetti code offered by Hubspot. We can't use any of their templates without intervention by either their tech support or our very busy engineers. Here's an example from yesterday. A blog article template has social media sharing buttons above the main body of text. The buttons are out of alignment. How are we supposed to be taken seriously by very demanding clientele if we can't get the basics right? In order to serve our customers, we need to demonstrate ""best practices"" in everything we do. Hubspot is a patchwork of less than excellent mechanisms cobbled together to satisfy small business marketing needs. Not a good match for us. What Hubspot does extremely well is create content for their own marketing. They have high domain authority for marketing automation. They've got the wonderful high touch customer service during the trial period. But the actual day-to-day implementation is far less than expected. To their credit, they also have managed to build partnerships and half competent integrations with other vendors in the marketing ecosystem. For example, when we talk to data suppliers like ZoomInfo or identity resolution vendors, integration with Hubspot is usually straightforward. I'll add that navigation of their dashboard is far less than intuitive. One of our interns has spent 50+ hours learning Hubspot basics so she could show the rest of us how to us it. Don't let anyone tell you that the UX is seamless or friction free! Unless things radically change we will bail out. In sum, Hubspot is a clear case of overpromise and underdeliver. It's adequate but far from excellent. Our verdict on Hubspot Hubspot are the most popular marketing automation tool for small businesses. While their product is excellent, you do need to be aware of price creep, as Hubspot’s pricing gets expensive as you require additional contacts.",HubSpot
Sales Marketing,"What is HubSpot? Matthew Deal As a product, HubSpot can seem a little confusing. While HubSpot is both a company and product (in the same way you refer to Q-tips as Q-tips versus “cotton swabs""). HubSpot is made up of six different products, each of which is referred to as HubSpot “Hubs”: HubSpot Marketing Hub HubSpot Sales Hub HubSpot Service Hub HubSpot Content Hub HubSpot Operations Hub HubSpot Commerce Hub All of these are helpful for streamlining your business's procedures into one integrated space. That's why using HubSpot and HubSpot CRM is vital to your company’s success. But what is the difference between HubSpot and HubSpot CRM? What is HubSpot? HubSpot, at its core, is a powerful Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. It's this CRM foundation that allows HubSpot to integrate and streamline a business's digital marketing and sales activities into a single, unified space. Much like the original description of HubSpot being an 'all-inclusive' software program, this CRM foundation serves a similar purpose. It's the bedrock upon which businesses can build and customize their use of HubSpot's various 'Hubs', each catering to unique aspects of their needs. The CRM isn't just a part of HubSpot—it's the heart of it. All of HubSpot's tools and services, from marketing to sales to service, are built on this foundation. This ensures that no matter which 'Hubs' a business chooses to utilize, they'll work together in perfect harmony, driven by the centralized customer data and insights provided by the CRM. This integrated approach, rooted in the power of the CRM, is what makes HubSpot such a dynamic and versatile tool for managing and growing your business. Generally speaking, many companies combine multiple HubSpot based on their business needs (which subsequently can impact pricing options). Each HubSpot “hub” has a specific focus area: sales, marketing, customer service, or operations. Who Uses HubSpot? If you’re running a business and have a marketing or sales team, you should be using HubSpot. HubSpot can help you do anything and everything – that’s the appeal. Examples of common HubSpot users include: Marketing analysts who want to optimize their automation campaigns. Customer service specialists who are looking to answer customer questions and complaints. Account executives who want to chase down hot and warm leads. A Note On Contacts Contacts are a key part of any CRM, including contacts in HubSpot. They are the main focus because they represent the people who interact with your business, such as potential customers or existing clients. We highlight contacts because they're a simple way to understand how data is managed in CRMs. In HubSpot, contacts are the center of all customer interactions, helping you keep track of everyone who engages with your business in any way. For more information and to dig into this, check out our blog post on what a contact is in HubSpot. Marketing Hub Marketing Hub is the perfect platform for growing traffic and leads and includes powerful features like marketing automation and email marketing. Hubspot's Marketing Hub lets you monitor marketing campaigns. You can examine how your Google, Facebook, and other paid ads perform. You and your team can also view, analyze, and filter your campaign data to see how well it's functioning. You can follow your social media activity within the platform by linking all your accounts. This lets you analyze your data and track your customers' engagement. What's more, you can engage with customers directly from HubSpot, and there is a HubSpot mobile app. Writing an email is easy and quick with HubSpot's templates. You and your team can track emails and organize them in one place. Send an email now or schedule it for another time. You will keep your customer service at its best. Every company needs a website, and HubSpot helps you keep yours organized. Marketing Hub assists you with building your landing pages, as they remain central to inbound marketing.

It will improve your business' response times and processes. The Live Chat service allows you and your customers to connect quickly. Additionally, conversational chatbots offer support, so your customers can get answers even when you're sleeping. These features can help you keep customers happy, and happy customers are the most loyal customers! Creating shared inboxes helps bring every employee on the same page. Scheduling emails gives you peace of mind knowing the task is complete. Furthermore, creating ""Snippets"" means that your frequently-used answers convert to ready-to-use text. It saves time because no one has to reinvent the wheel. The meeting planner sets up your meetings and sends contacts a link to your page, which contains a calendar that shows your availability. Additionally, you can track your best-performing emails and turn them into a template for your whole team to utilize. Service Hub’s ticket system helps you manage customer support requests. You enhance customer service with more sales tools, and your team member's communication methods stay ""on brand."" Another powerful feature is Service Hub's Knowledge Base, which allows you to build an all-inclusive information resource centered around your products or services. Acting as a self-help hub for your customers, the Knowledge Base ensures they find answers to their questions without delay. It's a win-win situation - your customer service team sees fewer routine queries, and your customers enjoy swift, self-serve solutions. Furthermore, the Knowledge Base is completely adjustable to your liking. This means you can mold its content and layout to align perfectly with your brand and customer requirements. This flexibility allows you to create a resource that not only meets your customers' needs but also represents your brand identity effectively.""

Furthermore, it is easy to use and enables your website to operate quickly and securely while simultaneously expanding your business.

If not, use one of the many themes and templates available through Content Hub. This product is unique when it comes to integrating data and analytics. It allows you access to more detailed and accurate information about your marketing and sales performance. Combine that with its speed and security, and you have a website that your customers will adore. Sales Hub Using the Sales Hub enterprise is the wisest way to guarantee your company grows.

Missing a lead or letting a valuable customer slip through the cracks is impossible. Your team will have everything they need to concentrate on the data-driven tasks that will support your company's growth. They can stay relevant in your business industry while finding leads and closing deals. What is a CRM and Why it is Important CRM stands for customer relationship management. For digital marketers, CRM often is a significant pain point. However, having outstanding CRM software at your disposal is like having a superhuman genius working alongside you. USA News and World Report writer Brandi Johnson explains it best. ""At its core, a CRM is simply a database that helps a company keep track of all of the details about prospects and customers."" CRM systems offer easy-to-use interfaces and workflows. Since customers stand as one of the most vital business assets, including a CRM in your company strategy is an essential move. You and your team can update and customize all of the information about your clients with a few clicks. Each piece of customer information lives under one platform. Therefore, keeping track of your clients' needs is easier than ever before. ""Having solid relationships with your clients is important if you want to build a stable and successful business,"" according to Finances Online. Building better customer relationships will never go out of style. Going back to basics with customer relations is the way to grow your business. Customers remain loyal to the businesses with the best customer service. And, Business News Daily reports, ""CRM is one of the world's fastest-growing industries, expected to grow at a rate of 14% between 2021 and 2027?"" Customer satisfaction means that the traffic you want to see on your site will flourish, and your business will prosper as well. What Does HubSpot CRM Do and Why You Should Use It HubSpot CRM integrates with many other systems, and its accessibility and ease of use remain the best. Melissa Randall from Lean Labs explains this. Instead of including a bunch of features that most people don't use or understand, [HubSpot CRM stays] focused on the essential components that make up a good quality software for managing customer relationships. To break it down: HubSpot is now known as HubSpot CRM. The company began with the name HubSpot, offering customer relationship management, and currently, it consists of the many platforms described above. Today, HubSpot CRM is a leading customer relationship management company. HubSpot's free CRM tool pairs with all of HubSpot's platforms and is one of the easiest CRMs to use. Every customer-facing team can use it, from marketing to sales and customer service. Upon signing up with HubSpot CRM, your account will come with a set of specific CRM objects, such as contacts, companies, and deals. However, you can create custom objects to represent and organize your CRM data according to your company's needs. Using HubSpot's free customer management tool gives your team a running start in growing your business. And upgrading to the professional and enterprise bundles (depending on your company's size and needs) makes company growth a reality. The process of honing customer relationships can be pretty complex. Using HubSpot CRM will assist you in handling your client relationships more effectively and efficiently. When you use HubSpot CRM, you remain relevant and successful. What Type of Software is HubSpot CRM HubSpot CRM is a cloud-based software program. Not only does using a cloud-based application save you money, but it also saves you time. It can make your customers' experience more personable. Hubspot let's you track all your contact (and their activity) in a single place. Essentially, you house all of your contacts in one place. Check your email, write an email using a template, and track the emails written. While writing an email, you can see the customer's information in the sidebar of your screen, which allows you to connect relevantly to the buyer. It doesn't create duplicate contacts once a contact's information is in the system either. Moreover, you can filter your contacts in many ways and customize your view. You can use the ""@"" sign if you want to mention a coworker. Use this function to work collaboratively as well. Why is HubSpot CRM so Important? Filter companies by pages, and when making a deal with a company or client, give the page a name and save it. This way, you can see where your sales are going. HubSpot CRM keeps you at the top of the game and, frankly, HubSpot works. It manages a plethora of your data so that you can focus on what is most important: the customer experience. Every business values customer service, but now it's more important than ever. The most efficient way to manage your customers is with a customer relationship management system. Having a single integrated system for your business's procedures is essential to your organization's success. Your business needs HubSpot CRM and its platforms to facilitate growth and support your team. Your willingness to produce change and give your team the best platforms available, helping them be as successful as possible, will determine how well your business thrives. How Much Does HubSpot Cost Good news: HubSpot CRM includes 23 free features so you can get your feet wet and decide if this is the tool for you. You can test out tools like ad management, deal pipeline, app marketplace integrations, ticketing, email marketing, and more. These free features are limited though. You’ll only be able to access basic analytics. If you’re ready to commit, HubSpot paid plans are priced according to what hub you decide to use. This plan offers monthly or upfront pricing models. Prices vary depending on how many Hubs/suites (like the CMS Hub, Sales Hub, etc.) you need, the type of Hub, and if you’re using the tool at either the Starter, Professional, or Enterprise scale. Starter: Includes 1 seat and 1,000 contacts. Professional: Number of seats included depends on your Hub. Includes 2,000 marketing contacts. You can add additional seats for $50/month. Enterprise: Number of seats included depends on your chosen Hub. Includes 10,000 marketing contacts. You can add additional seats for $75/month. Here’s a breakdown of what the prices would look like for each Hub per month: Hub Starter Professional Enterprise Marketing $15/Month Per Seat $800/Month Includes 3 seats $3,600/Month Includes 5 seats Sales $20/Month Per Seat $100/Month Per Seat $150/Month Per Seat Service $20/Month Per Seat $100/Month Per Seat $130/Month Per Seat Content $15/Month Per Seat $450/Month Includes 3 seats $1,500/Month Includes 5 seats Operations $20/Month Per Seat $800/Month Per Seat $2,000/Month Per Seat Commerce Free Pay as you go model The Commerce Hub operates on a pay as you go mode, where you're only charged for any fees or transactions made via the Commerce Hub features. You can always add more users or contacts for additional costs. A Note On HubSpot Pricing Many people are surprised to find out that you can actually negotiate on your HubSpot contact. At Vaulted, because we're an official HubSpot Partner, we have some sway on pricing and may be able to save you a significant amount on your HubSpot purchase. Is HubSpot Worth It? We’re a little biased, but in our opinion as long-term HubSpot users, yes, HubSpot is 100% worth it. HubSpot has all of the tools you need to make a sale in one place. It makes it easy for your marketing and sales team to stay informed. You can do anything from attract leads by building content, engage leads with regular emails, or make the sale. And since you can do that all in one tool, it’s easy to track and attribute credit to the correct channels. It also helps that HubSpot differs from its competitor because of its free offerings. You can test out its Hubs (to a limited capacity) to triple check that this is the best choice for your team. HubSpot can be on the pricier side for SMB, but if you’re looking to invest in your team and marketing and sales funnel, you can’t go wrong.",HubSpot

Sales Marketing,"What is SEMrush semrush Definition: SemRush is one of the most widely used SEO tools by digital marketers. It allows you to perform SEO and SEM audits of a web page and those of its competition through different tools. It is mainly used to monitor organic positioning, although it also has functions to optimize PPC campaigns, content and management of social networks, as well as the link building strategy. For its utilities and the type of clients it targets, large companies and marketing agencies especially, it competes with other SEO audit platforms such as Sistrix or Ahrefs. 1 How SEMrush came about 2 The main functions of SEMrush 3 What SEMrush allows you to do for free 4 Tutorial de SEMrush How SEMrush came about SEMrush was created in 2008 by SEO and information technology experts Oleg Shchegolev and Dmitry Melnikov as a project to “make online competition fair and transparent,” as it explains on its own website. Its origin is in SEOquake,a free extension for Google Chrome that allows basic SEO analysis and that still exists today, although its founders explain that with a very different objective than its SEMrush. The latter currently has more than three million users worldwide and analyzes searches made in more than 150 countries, including Spain. The main functions of SEMrush SEMrush is a platform in constant update, so its tools are renewed periodically. Its menu is structured in the following blocks of tools: SEO, advertising, social networks, content and analysis of the competition. Within the SEO section, through the main search bar it is possible to analyze: A domain (www.arimetrics.com) A keyword (‘digital marketing agency’) A specific URL (https://www.arimetrics.com/servicios/agencia-seo-posicionamiento-web-buscadores). In SEO there are a number of subsections: competitor research (analyzes a web page individually and with respect to its competition), keyword research, backlink generation, ranking tracking and ON Page SEO (more technical). One of the main advantages of SEMrush is that it allows you to store projects (according to the contracted plan), very useful in case you work on many web pages at the same time. Through the dashboard or panel of each project it is very easy to observe the evolution of the keywords and the possibilities of improving SEO On Page. You can connect with other tools like Google Analytics and major social networks to get all the metrics on the same platform. What SEMrush allows you to do for free Using the free version allows you to discover your possibilities by working as a trial before deciding whether to hire one of the paid plans. As usual in this type of platform, the functionalities without cost are very limited. For example, you can only do 10 searches a day and see the first results. There are three payment plans, whose prices range from $ 99 to $ 399 per month (Pro, Guru and Business). If the payment is made on an annual basis, all plans have a small discount. There is also a customized version according to the needs of the user called Enterprise. SEMrush does not require permanence and allows you to change the contracted plan at any time. Tutorial de SEMrush On the Internet you can find a multitude of SEMrush tutorials to get the most out of it, use strategies, discover tricks, etc. Many of them are videos published by the best known experts in digital marketing and, specifically, in SEO.

After extensively using Semrush, I thought of writing down my experience of using this tool and highlight the Pros and cons of Semrush to someone who wants to use it but hasn’t bought a subscription yet. In this unbiased Semrush review, I have tried to highlight some of the key features of Semrush and it’s pros and cons, so you can make a correct decision of whether it makes sense to invest in a premium keyword research tool or go with free ones (Google Adword keyword planner, Keyword Tool.io, etc) What is Semrush? Key Features of Semrush Let us now dive into some of the most prominent features of Semrush. Feature Description Easy and Complete Organic Research Using free tools keyword research tools may not work too well, considering the fact that there are billions of websites out there doing exactly the same thing. This is where Semrush comes in and helps you score one up and stay ahead in the race by helping you figure out keywords that drive traffic to your competitor’s website. Monitor Changes A successful Content Strategy has to be dynamic and must keep up with the fast-changing preferences of the internet. You must monitor the changes in your website’s ranking and also that of your competitors on a regular basis. Semrush not only helps you monitor these changes but also helps you to find out new competitors so that you don’t lose out on your rankings. Get Relevant Backlinks Backlinks are still a strong signal to search engines, they use backlinks to figure out the authority of a website. You can see Semrush backlink audit tool to quickly build a list of spam backlinks and use the link building tool to find opportunities of getting relevant backlinks to your site.

With the CPC Map, you can delve deeper into the regional CPC rates and more, and dig up useful data for A/B testing, just in case you wish to try pulling some paid traffic to your website on a dry day. Semrush Pricing – Is it Worth Your Money? Is Semrush worth the money? The answer is Yes as well as No. Semrush is worth the money if You are serious about your online business and want to grow it Most of your website traffic comes organically from search engines and you cannot compromise losing on high-quality organic traffic that converts to sales or revenue. Your websites already generate some revenue and you want to grow the revenue through strategic measures. You are facing steep competition and want to be ahead of the curve. You need new ideas to open new channels for your business and acquire customers in different categories, segments, geographies and want to understand their intent better. Semrush is not worth the money if You have just started out and tinkered with a new business idea or a blog. You have little to no experience in any online business, especially the one which heavily depends on content for customer acquisition or lead generation. You have no content in your website or blog, you are learning the ropes. By no content, I mean very less content (e.g less than 50 posts). You are satisfied with Free keyword research tools and don’t want advanced analysis or cutting edge details about your competition. You don’t know what SEO is and you are planning to outsource the work to an agency. Semrush offers 4 plans, which can be billed either on a monthly or on an annual basis. To get the best deal, we recommend you always choose to pay on an annual basis. Yes, it costs more one time but you will be saving money at the end of the year, compared to the monthly plan. Let us now take a dig at each of these 4 plans and figure out its suitability for various set-ups. Semrush Pricing - Pro Plan Semrush Pro Plan The most basic plan by Semrush is the pro plan which is suitable for Freelancers and solo business owners. The number of projects under this plan is limited to 5 only, and that it isn’t quite feasible for seasoned freelancers who work with tens, if not hundreds of clients. However, this is the ideal plan for an individual business owner who wants to use Semrush to optimize his own website, and not work for clients on SEO projects. Blog owners who wish to do their own SEO analysis and have just ventured into the website business can experiment with it. The Pro Plan costs $99 a month (billed monthly) and $996 (billed yearly) You should take the Pro plan if Your website makes some revenue and you can afford to invest $99 a month to get access to invaluable data, which in turn can increase the revenue of your online business. You do not work for clients on SEO projects and will never have to monitor hundreds of competing websites for a specific brand or business You are okay to be limited to 5 projects. You are okay not to have access to historical data. You will not need to track more than 500 keywords on a daily basis You won’t need branded or white-label PDF reports to share with clients. You will not need to crawl more than 1,00,000 URL’s of your sites by Semrush You will be the only user and won’t need to add additional users to your account. Semrush Guru Plan If you have more than 5 websites under your belt, you may consider investing in the Guru plan by Semrush, which lets you manage and execute 50 projects, and also segregate the source of traffic based on the devices used by the users. This lets you plan the right content strategy because you can then focus on the length and structure of your content. We consider this plan to be far more beneficial than the pro plan for freelancers involved in digital marketing. Semrush Guru Plan costs $199 a month (billed monthly) and $1992 (billed yearly) You should take the Guru plan if You own a digital marketing agency and have parallel projects running all day long, you cannot be restricted with only 5 projects. You need historical data, so you can analyze the trends of keywords, niches and see what worked in the past but is not working now. You want branded PDF reports to share with your clients and companies you do consulting with and do not want to use Semrush’s default branding. Business and Enterprise Plans The Business and Enterprise plans are suitable for larger digital marketing agencies, eCommerce sites with huge revenues and turnovers, large corporations and enterprises. If budget isn’t a constraint then we strongly recommend the Business plan for all digital marketing firms with 10 or more clients. Enterprises and larger companies can talk with Semrush team to decide a custom pricing for Semrush, according to their needs. Semrush Business Plan costs $399 a month (billed monthly) and $3996 (billed yearly). You should take the business or enterprise plan of Semrush if Budget is not a constraint for you and you want no limits and restrictions on your projects or data API access and integration with your application software Google Data studio reports, scheduling PDF reports, and white labeling Pros and Cons of Using Semrush Every tool will have some positives and some negatives. Semrush is no exception, it is indeed a very useful tool with lots of features but it has its limitations as well which I must mention to you. Given below I have listed some of the benefits and limitations of Semrush but I do feel the benefits strongly outweighs the cons Pros Cons Intensive keyword research Gives thorough and comprehensive keyword analysis and lets you pick the right ones according to your niche. Not a friendly User Interface The user interface is not very user-friendly and requires a certain degree of understanding and experience. In other words, the user interface is a little too technical for beginners but this can be easily fixed with a quick course in SEO and digital marketing. Reasonably priced Except for the Pro plan by Semrush, all the plans are reasonably priced for small and midsize businesses. A disadvantage in case of subsequent logging A single Semrush login can be used by one user only, but just in case you share it with someone else and that person subsequently logs in with the same account then the user who logged in earlier loses access. It would help if Semrush fixes this glitch and ensures that the subsequent user is warned of unauthorized access or something similar. Provides detailed information about Visitors Semrush lets you take a peep into the demographics of your users, such as age, gender, the location which helps you to offer the right products or services to them. Fear Factor Some Semrush users complain that Semrush sends out too many warnings in a bid to keep the subscribers hooked on to their services, which sometimes does just the opposite. Help identify Toxic Elements Spammy backlinks can do more harm to your search engine rankings than you can ever imagine. Semrush backlink audit tool helps you identify and get rid of them and several other toxic elements. Too big to handle With the many tools to help you manage your SEO and digital marketing strategies, Semrush isn’t quite easy to get your head around. If you are a complete beginner, it will take you some time to get used to the tool which is actually quite complicated to a first-timer. One-stop Solution Semrush is a one-stop solution for all your SEO, digital marketing, and business intelligence requirements. Inaccurate Ad Spend Data Several users have complained about inaccurate data regarding the ad spend, export and other things. Again, this could be speculation or a one time glitch, and this happens with every other product Our Verdict and Suggestion For a website’s long-term success, it’s crucial that you get a steady stream of organic traffic. To get organic traffic, you have to do keyword research, target the right keywords that are profitable, know what your competitors are doing and be 10 steps ahead of them.If you can afford to spend $99 a month and you are serious about growing your website’s business, I would strongly recommend you give it a try for 2-3 months. You won’t regret this decision. Consider this. After implementing suggestions from the keyword optimization tool, I was able to increase one of my website’s revenue by 23%, this recovers the $99 monthly investment for me. Sure I am still paying for the subscription but at the same time, my revenues and sales are also increasing, which is absolutely vital for the success of my business. However, if you are just starting out and don’t know the basics, don’t have enough content on the website and have not hustled a bit, I would suggest you stay limited to free keyword research tools. You don’t need an advanced tool yet, you can do it later. You should focus on creating good content and learn the basics of website development, monetization, promotion, SEO and so forth. What do you think are the major pros and cons of Semrush? Let us know in the comments below.",SemRush

Semrush key features Domain Analysis Keyword research Rank tracking Backlink analysis Site audit Semrush pricing and value for money Semrush pros and cons Semrush pros Semrush cons Final verdict on Semrush What is Semrush? The Semrush SEO tool is a big piece of software that helps improve your website and SEO. You can use it to get different types of data about your website, or those of competitors. Using this data, you find opportunities that help you get an edge. For example, Semrush can help you analyze: What people are searching online What topics you can create content for to get more traffic Which websites you can target for link-building outreach What technical aspects you can improve on your website And this is just the tip of the iceberg. The Semrush tool comes with hundreds of small and large features to help improve your online presence. We will go through some of these features in this Semrush review. Case in point: Edelweiss Bakery. When faced with a shortage of orders, it used the Semrush SEO tool to identify what to optimize in three key areas: main SEO, content marketing, and ecommerce. And Semrush helped them improve both organic traffic and search rankings for multiple keywords. Using Semrush, the company was able to boost its mobile organic traffic by 460%. Estimated traffic trend of Edelweiss Bakery Image Source: Semrush Who is Semrush for? Semrush has been designed with a general business audience in mind. That said, an SEO background will definitely help you get more from the software. It’s best suited for experienced bloggers, digital marketing professionals, and agencies for whom SEO is serious business. Because that’s when they’d be willing to invest $100 or more per month on such a tool. Semrush key features Now that you know what Semrush is, let’s continue this Semrush review with some of the core SEO tools you get with your subscription. Domain Analysis A typical SEO project starts with domain analysis, in which you get an overview of the strength of your domain from an SEO perspective. Based on this data, you determine the right approach to improve your website’s SEO. Alternatively, you can analyze a competitor’s domain and compare the results with yours. So you get an accurate sense of the time, budget, and efforts you’ll need to outrank the rival. Domain analysis also helps you shortlist websites that you might approach to build backlinks. That’s because a backlink from a high authority domain holds more value than a low-value domain. To conduct a domain analysis in the Semrush SEO tool, just enter the domain URL in the ‘domain overview’ section. And you’ll get a detailed report on where the domain stands. The metric that’ll give you the quickest assessment of your website is the ‘authority score.’ There’s one thing you need to keep in mind when you review the different metrics in your report. While most of the numbers you’re seeing are based on hard data, the traffic numbers are not. They are estimates. So they may not always be 100% correct. Also, a great feature worth mentioning here is the competitive positioning map. It’s a visual that shows you where your site stands against similar players in your niche. Another noteworthy report is the breakdown of the search intent behind the keywords a domain ranks for. This gives you a sense of why people click on certain links when they search for a keyword. For example, do they need information on a topic, or do they want to make a purchase? This is crucial data as search intent is one of the key SEO trends that marketers are focusing on these days. According to Gartner, over 70% of marketers will utilize third-party intent data for sales and marketing by the end of 2022. However, one key data point we found missing in the Semrush tool is the cost estimate. For example, when you conduct domain analysis in Ahrefs, it shows you the cost of advertising for the same amount of traffic that you’re getting organically from search. So you get to know how much money you have saved by investing in SEO as compared to advertising. It’s not that the Semrush SEO tool doesn’t give you this data, but it’s not part of the domain overview report. To get this data in Semrush, you’ll have to navigate to a separate report, known as Organic Research. Overall, the domain analysis feature of Semrush is solid, and it gives you a ton of valuable insights into the SEO performance of a domain. Keyword research The Keyword Overview tool in Semrush gives you essential data on your target keyword. This includes: Number of searches per month Difficulty score (how hard would it be to rank for the keyword) Websites that are ranking for the keyword Related keywords you can target And you can do this analysis for a specific country. To get even more keyword suggestions in detail, you can use the Keyword Magic tool. It gives you a more extensive list of keywords, along with the same metrics as discussed above. You can also sort or filter this data based on a specific metric. When it comes to keyword research, one of Semrush’s unique features is the inclusion of keyword intent. It tells you whether the search intent is I, N, C, or T (informational, navigational, commercial, or transactional). If the intent is informational, that means the user wants to find information on a specific topic. And if it’s commercial, the user is considering a product or service. Navigational intent implies that the user wants to locate a website, and a transactional intent signals the desire to complete an action. These insights provide you with more context about the keywords than search volume alone. And they help you make better decisions. The bottom line? Semrush’s keyword research tool is a comprehensive solution to analyze and find the right keywords for your business. Rank tracking Rank tracking lets you monitor the position of your website in search engine result pages for the keywords you select. To set this up in the Semrush tool, head over to the position tracker section and enter a domain name. Next, just add the keywords for which you want to track search rankings. That’s it. You will now get a report showing how your website is performing in the SERPs (search engine result pages), and how the ranking is changing over time. You can also set up email notifications for important events, such as when your website hits one of the top 10 spots, or when its ranking drops for a keyword. Overall, it’s a robust feature that works well in general. Backlink analysis A website’s SEO performance depends heavily on the number of backlinks pointing to it from other sites. In fact, according to a study by Backlinko, the #1 result in Google has an average of 3.8x more backlinks than positions #2-#10. So backlinks analysis is one of the most critical features of any SEO tool. And Semrush doesn’t disappoint here too. Enter a domain name it will show you a vast index of backlinks it has. There’s plenty of valuable data here, along with trends showing when a website has gained or lost backlinks. You can also see how valuable each of the links is from an SEO perspective. Site audit An SEO audit analyzes your website for on-page SEO factors and lets you identify areas of improvement. According to Geoff Kennedy, Head of Marketing at Sitebulb: “The goal of an SEO audit is to improve a website’s presence and performance in Google and other search engines.” That’s why another valuable feature worth mentioning in this Semrush review is the site auditing functionality. It can help you identify issues like: Slow-loading pages Duplicate content SSL errors Crawling problems Google’s core web vitals (to assess website speed and stability) Missing headers and other metadata Keyword stuffing A great addition to this feature is the ability to export tasks. For the issues you want to address, you can turn them into tasks and assign them to your team members in any of the popular project management apps. There is direct integration with Trello. And if you use another project management tool, you can connect it with Semrush using Zapier. Semrush pricing and value for money Getting access to a large amount of data and competitor intelligence is expensive. For this reason, tools like Semrush don’t come for cheap. If you’re looking for more affordable SEO software, Mangools would be a better fit for you. The Semrush SEO tool has three main pricing plans: Pro: $119.95 per month Guru: $229.95 per month Business: $449.95 per month But you can get a 17% discount if you agree to pay for the whole year in advance. The three plans differ in not just the number of reports or keywords you get to view, but also the features you get access to. With the Guru and Business plans, for example, you get access to content marketing tools not available in the Pro plan. Also, you can try it at no cost for seven days to see if it meets your needs. But you’ll have to give your credit card details to claim the free trial. Semrush pros and cons Now, let’s look at the key factors we liked and didn’t like about Semrush. Semrush pros The Semrush tool shines bright in the following areas: Breadth and depth of features: Semrush tries to provide as many SEO, content marketing, and social media features as possible under a single roof. A vast and largely accurate database: The accuracy of an SEO tool’s analysis depends heavily on the quality and quantity of its link index. And Semrush fairs well in this aspect. It boasts of 43 trillion URLs in its link database, which is comparable to competitors Moz (43 trillion), Ahrefs (29 trillion), and Majestic (10 trillion). Generous reporting limits: As compared to similar products, the Semrush tool lets you pull a good number of reports per day. PPC data: As seen in this Semrush review, the tool doesn’t just provide intelligence for SEO, but also lets you improve other types of campaigns, including PPC. It goes ahead of other tools by presenting you with detailed CPC competition and distribution reports, ad previews, and panning tools. Semrush cons Here are some of the annoying aspects of Semrush: Pricing: The worst part of using the Semrush SEO tool is that you get only one user account with any plan. So you can’t add any team members. And adding each new user would cost you $45 to $100 extra. Compare this with Semrush’s leading competitors, who are more generous in this area. Unlike Semrush, you get to add more users in other tools’ high-tier plans. Another factor that makes Semrush expensive is that some features can only be accessed with an addon. And you pay $200 per month for the addon. User interface and ease of use: The Semrush interface is similar to other leading SEO software in the market. You get lots of data packaged in the form of lists, tables, and graphs. And everything is easy to understand if you have some background in SEO. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be simplified. Mangools, for example, has a much better UI that suits even beginners. And it doesn’t even cost as much as Semrush. Final verdict on Semrush To sum up this Semrush review, it is a solid SEO tool that gives an abundance of data you need for SEO success. There are some downsides with regard to pricing and other factors we mentioned above. But overall, the Semrush SEO tool is a strong contender for marketers in highly competitive niches. Because in a competitive market, you need all the data you can get to improve your search rankings. Start your free 7-day trial. Did we miss anything in this Semrush review?

My Experience Using Semrush as a Professional Digital Marketer As the former editor of the Elegant Themes blog, I have personally used Semrush for years. I’ve found it to be an indispensable tool. While the platform has expanded over the years, it began as an SEO platform. As a result, its SEO-related tools are industry-leading. It makes it easy to identify keywords and topics you want to rank for, especially in highly competitive niches like WordPress. It also makes it possible to expand into related topics successfully. The learning curve was steep but not steeper than I expected. If you want to do something challenging and complex, you should expect your tools to be sophisticated and require training. Our team learned to use Semrush through their free resources, blog posts by others, and exploration of the tool itself. The results have been well worth it.

Semrush Pros and Cons In this article, we’ve discussed many details, even though we’ve summarized a lot. To further simplify things, I’ve compiled a list of pros and cons below. Pros Robust SEO Capabilities: Semrush has created industry-leading SEO tools for every essential task. Tools for keyword research, backlink analysis, site auditing, position tracking, on-page SEO, and more. Effective Advertising Tools: Semrush helps users improve online ad campaigns, analyze competition, and research keywords across various platforms.

Educational Resources: Semrush helps users improve their digital marketing skills by providing a wealth of free educational resources. Extra Tools: Semrush offers additional SaaS solutions that complement its core product—tools like Content Marketplace, E-commerce Booster, Prowly, Kompyte, and SplitSignal. Cons Limited Number of Projects: With basic plans, the number of projects you can manage simultaneously is limited. This may restrict users from managing multiple websites or client portfolios. Complex User Interface: The vast array of tools and features can make the user interface feel overwhelming. This is particularly true for beginners who are new to digital marketing. Learning Curve: Understanding and using all the platform’s features takes time and effort because it is comprehensive. Expensive Pricing Plans: Semrush’s most advanced features are only available in the higher-priced plans. Slow Report Generation: Users have reported slow report generation times during peak usage hours, which can impact productivity. Limited Social Media Platforms: The social media toolkit currently supports Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Google My Business. The absence of others like Snapchat and TikTok might be a drawback for some users. Restricted API Access: Semrush restricts API access to its higher-tier plans. This limits the ability of lower-tier users to integrate Semrush with other tools and systems their business uses. Semrush Alternatives While it’s true that Semrush is a best-in-class tool, the alternatives below are also highly recommended. Some folks may find that their needs are more limited than the number of tools they’d be paying for with Semrush. Or, they may want a tool that focuses only on a specific aspect of digital marketing. In any event, these are some Semrush alternatives worth considering. SE Ranking screenshot of se rankings website SE Ranking shines in terms of affordability and simplicity—an ideal choice for small businesses or those new to SEO. However, while its feature set is broad, it does not offer the same depth of functionality found in Semrush. BrightLocal screenshot of BrightLocal website BrightLocal and Semrush are powerful SEO tools that serve slightly different needs. Specializing in local SEO, BrightLocal is an ideal choice for businesses wanting to enhance their local online visibility. Features like its local search audit, citation builder, local search grid, and reputation manager help companies bring a laser focus to establishing their local presence. On the other hand, Semrush offers a broader range of SEO tools, including keyword research, site audits, and competitor analysis, making it ideal for comprehensive digital marketing campaigns. SEObility screenshot of SEObility website SEObility and Semrush are comprehensive SEO tools with their own strengths. Praised for its website optimization features, SEObility primarily intends to check your site thoroughly for improvement opportunities. It also has a slightly higher rating on the popular software review and comparison site G2, with 4.6/5 stars from 233 reviews. On the other hand, Semrush is highly rated for its broad range of features, like keyword research and competitor analysis. It has a rating of 4.5/5 stars from 1,876 reviews on G2. The choice between the two often depends on specific user needs and preferences–including, perhaps especially, price point. Ahrefs screenshot of ahrefs website One of the primary alternatives to Semrush is Ahrefs, which is renowned for its backlink analysis capabilities. Users might choose Ahrefs over Semrush if they prioritize link building and require extensive backlink data. Ahrefs also has a more straightforward interface that is often easier for beginners to navigate. Moz Pro screenshot of moz pro website Semrush and Moz Pro provide various digital marketing tools to boost online visibility. People know Semrush for its all-inclusive features, while Moz Pro excels in local SEO. This makes Moz Pro a solid choice for businesses focusing on improving local market presence. SpyFu screenshot of spyfu website In the world of SEO tools, Spyfu is a formidable contender. While Semrush is more comprehensive, SpyFu focuses on competition spying and keyword insights. For marketers with a narrower focus, it may be the better tool. Serpstat screenshot of serpstat website Serpstat is great at keyword research and SEO analysis. However, when comparing the user interface, educational resources, and overall suite of tools and features, Semrush often comes out on top. While both platforms have robust SERP features, choosing between Semrush and Serpstat typically comes to budget. SEO Powersuite screenshot of so powersuite website SEO PowerSuite is a desktop application offering an all-in-one SEO toolkit. It includes keyword research, backlink analysis, rank tracking, and on-page SEO auditing capabilities. The choice between Semrush and SEO PowerSuite often comes down to the specific needs and preferences of the user, such as the preference for a web vs desktop tool, the need for ongoing learning resources, or budget constraints. Semrush Review: The Verdict Semrush stands out as an incredibly comprehensive and versatile digital marketing platform. It excels because of its extensive range of tools, user-friendly interface, and robust educational resources. It’s an excellent fit for anyone doing a wide variety of marketing tasks–especially teams. The most commonly cited critique of Semrush is its complexity and steep learning curve. However, given the complex nature of the work itself and the high-quality educational materials provided, that may be a moot point to serious marketing professionals. Another common critique (or at least downside) often associated with Semrush is its price point. Again, anyone taking full advantage of this platform to service multiple clients should have no problem affording it. On the other hand, website owners who may be just as serious but have less marketing experience may want to be more careful, ensuring that the value they’re getting is worth the price. Ultimately, those who need and can afford it would be hard-pressed to find a better digital marketing solution than Semrush.

Sales Marketing,"Semrush in 2024: Exploring the Pros and Cons Last Updated : 15 Mar, 2024 The internet is a vast marketplace, and just like any marketplace, competition is fierce. If you’re a business owner or marketer looking to stand out online, you need the right tools in your arsenal. Enter SEMrush, an all-in-one digital marketing platform designed to help you conquer the online world. But before you dive in, let’s explore what SEMrush offers and how it can benefit your business. SEMrush can seem intimidating at first glance, but fear not! It’s essentially a powerful toolbox filled with features to boost your website’s traffic, attract more customers, and ultimately increase your sales. Imagine SEMrush as your digital marketing assistant, guiding you through every step of the process. Table of Content What SEMrush can do for you? Pros of SEMrush Cons of SEMrush Customer Support and Resources Conclusion What SEMrush can do for you? Uncover hidden keywords: Like finding buried treasure, SEMrush helps you discover the keywords people are searching for online that are relevant to your business. Spy on your competitors (ethically, of course!): SEMrush lets you analyze what your competitors are doing online, so you can learn from their successes and avoid their mistakes. Fine-tune your website: Think of SEMrush as a website doctor. It identifies areas for improvement to ensure your website is running smoothly and attracting visitors. Craft captivating content: SEMrush gives you insights into what kind of content resonates with your audience, so you can create content that keeps them coming back for more. Run targeted ads: SEMrush helps you launch effective online advertising campaigns to reach the right people at the right time. Track your progress: Just like with any journey, it’s important to see how far you’ve come. SEMrush provides valuable data and reports to track your progress and measure the success of your online marketing efforts. Pros of SEMrush Now that you have a general idea of what SEMrush can do, let’s delve deeper into some of its key advantages: Comprehensive Keyword Research Finding the right keywords is like having a treasure map for your online marketing journey. SEMrush offers a powerful keyword research tool that helps you discover: Search Volume: This tells you how many people are searching for a particular keyword each month. The higher the search volume, the more potential customers you can reach. Competition Level: This indicates how difficult it is to rank for a specific keyword. Lower competition is ideal, as it means you have a better chance of appearing at the top of search results. Related Keywords: SEMrush suggests additional keywords related to your main topic, helping you expand your reach and attract a wider audience. Imagine you run a bakery. Using SEMrush’s keyword research tool, you might discover that “best cupcakes near me” has a high search volume but also high competition. However, you might find “easy chocolate chip cookie recipe” has a good search volume with lower competition. This allows you to target both high-intent searchers looking for a bakery and potential customers searching for baking recipes, potentially leading them to discover your bakery and try your delicious treats! Competitor Analysis Knowledge is power, and when it comes to online marketing, knowing what your competitors are doing can give you a significant edge. SEMrush’s competitor analysis tools allow you to: See their top keywords: Uncover the keywords your competitors are ranking for and identify potential gaps in your own keyword strategy. Analyze their website traffic: Gain insights into how much traffic your competitors are attracting and where it’s coming from. Compare your advertising strategies: See what kind of ads your competitors are running and identify opportunities to create more effective campaigns for your own business. Feature What You Can Learn Example Top Keywords Identify keywords your competitor ranks for but you don’t. You discover a local bakery competitor ranks highly for “gluten-free cake pops.” Website Traffic See where your competitor’s website traffic comes from (organic search, social media, etc.). You learn your competitor receives a lot of traffic from recipe blogs featuring their desserts. Advertising Strategies Analyze the type of ads your competitor runs (search ads, social media ads). You see your competitor runs targeted ads on Facebook featuring their new line of seasonal cupcakes. On-Page SEO Optimization Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is all about making your website search engine friendly, so it appears higher in search results when people search for keywords related to your business. SEMrush equips you with tools to: Identify technical SEO issues: Think of these as roadblocks on your website that might prevent search engines from finding and indexing your content. SEMrush helps you identify and fix these issues to ensure your website is running smoothly. Optimize your website content: SEMrush analyzes your website content and suggests improvements to target relevant keywords and make it more appealing to search engines. Track your SEO progress: Monitor your website’s ranking for important keywords over time and see how your SEO efforts are paying off. Imagine you have a blog post on your bakery website about the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe. SEMrush might suggest optimizing the title to include relevant keywords like “easy chocolate chip cookie recipe” and adding internal links to other baking recipe blog posts on your website. This improves the overall SEO health of your website and increases the chances of your recipe appearing higher in search results when people search for cookie recipes. Backlink Analysis Backlinks are like votes of confidence for your website in the online world. When other websites link to your content, it tells search engines that your website is valuable and trustworthy. SEMrush helps you: Identify your backlinks: See where your backlinks are coming from and understand the quality of these links. High-quality backlinks from reputable websites can significantly boost your SEO ranking. Find backlink opportunities: Discover potential websites where you can earn valuable backlinks and expand your online reach. Let’s say your bakery partners with a local food blogger who features your delicious cupcakes on their website with a link back to your bakery website. SEMrush would identify this as a valuable backlink, helping to improve your website’s authority and search engine ranking. Content Marketing Creating high-quality content is essential for attracting and engaging your audience. SEMrush offers features to: Discover trending topics: See what kind of content is currently popular and relevant to your audience. Analyze your content performance: Track how well your existing content is performing and identify areas for improvement. Create content calendars: Organize your content creation process and ensure you’re consistently publishing fresh and engaging content. Using SEMrush’s content marketing tools, you discover that blog posts featuring “vegan baking tips” are trending. This might inspire you to create a blog post on your bakery website showcasing delicious vegan cookie recipe options, attracting a new audience segment interested in vegan treats. Paid Advertising (PPC) Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising allows you to display targeted ads to potential customers searching for keywords related to your business. SEMrush helps you: Manage your PPC campaigns: Create, monitor, and optimize your PPC campaigns to ensure you’re getting the most out of your advertising budget. Target the right audience: Reach potential customers who are most likely to be interested in your products or services.

User-Friendly Interface Even the most powerful tools can be useless if they’re too complex to use.

Most Powerful Semrush Features for Improving Your Search Rankings Semrush Metrics: How to Track & Visualize Your Semrush Data in Databox Free Semrush Dashboard Templates Easily Monitor and Report Your SEO Data with Databox ga_seo_dashboard_template_databox What Is Semrush and How Does It Work? Semrush is a popular SEO tool for conducting keyword research, competitor analysis, and Google Ad optimization. It is an all-in-one marketing reporting software designed to help digital marketers optimize their websites for better organic search traffic. You can also see how you stack up against your competitors and make better data-driven decisions around what keywords to target for both organic search efforts and Google ad campaigns. Many of the leading brands use Semrush, including Booking.com, Quora, HP, and eBay. By using this advanced SEO tool, you can quickly recognize patterns and trends in your specific niche. This will allow you to review your on-page SEO and identify which areas need to be optimized for more efficient lead generation. Additionally, Semrush is one of the best tools for keyword research. You will gain an insight into which keywords your competitors are applying and see how they are ranked. With the wealthy amount of data you receive, it will be much easier to stay on top of your competition and follow the latest trends. Although Semrush is used by some of the biggest internet marketers in the world due to its variety of advanced features, it is also very suitable for beginners. You can easily navigate through the platform and even with limited experience, Semrush makes understanding SEO much easier. To summarize, Semrush works by providing users with an abundance of information that can be used for: Improving the overall performance of your website Tracking the most popular keywords on Google Creating content that has a high chance of drawing visitors Finding new opportunities for link-building Adjusting the technical elements on your website that will result in better search engine positioning Is Semrush a Free Tool? Semrush does have a free version, but it comes with limited services and functionality. Some of the things you can do with a free account are: Create and operate one Semrush project 10 daily inquiries regarding keyword/competitor research Keyword tracking (limited to 10 keywords) Examine 100 pages of your website While these features can be useful for beginners in digital marketing, the free version doesn’t offer nearly as much versatility and benefits as the paid version. If you aren’t sure whether you should subscribe to Semrush, there is a 14-day free trial to test out their software. Paid plans range from $119.95 to $449.95 per month or $99.95 to $374.95 per month if you pay for an annual subscription. They also offer an enterprise plan for big brands that require additional flexibility and customization. What Is the Difference Between Semrush and Google Analytics? Semrush and Google Analytics are currently the two most popular analytic tools among internet marketers. While they have some similar features, these two offer two completely different types of services. The main difference between them is that Google Analytics is used by marketers to analyze the internal data on their website, while Semrush shifts the focus to external data and analyzes your competitor’s website. Acquiring the internal data of your competitor’s website is not possible, so the information you get from Semrush is practically the next best thing. PRO TIP: How to Monitor and Evaluate Your SEO Performance If you want to understand how your visitors are behaving on your landing pages, there are several on-page events and metrics you can track from Google Analytics 4 and Google Search Console that will help: Organic clicks by queries. Which search queries generate the most clicks to your website? Organic clicks by page. Which pages receive the most clicks from search results pages? Organic sessions. How many organic search sessions does your website receive? Organic engaged sessions. How many website visitors were engaged with your content? An engaged session lasts longer than 10 seconds, has a conversion event, or has at least 2 pageviews or screenviews. Views per channel. Which channels generate the most views to your website? And more… Now you can benefit from the experience of our SEO and website conversion experts, who have put together a plug-and-play Databox template showing the most important metrics for monitoring your landing page performance. It’s simple to implement and start using as a standalone dashboard or in marketing reports, and best of all, it’s free! GA4 SEO dashboard template You can easily set it up in just a few clicks – no coding required. To set up the dashboard, follow these 3 simple steps: Step 1: Get the template Step 2: Connect your Google Analytics 4 and Google Search Console accounts with Databox. Step 3: Watch your dashboard populate in seconds. What Is the Difference Between Semrush and Ahrefs? Contrary to Google Analytics, Ahrefs is much more similar to Semrush since it is also an SEO research tool that focuses on external elements of competitors’ websites. Nowadays, both of these tools offer pretty much the same variety of features and services, but this hasn’t always been the case. Only a few years ago, Ahrefs was known strictly as a backlink analysis tool. However, the company decided to add an abundance of new features in the meantime, making Ahrefs a worthy competitor in the SEO research industry. The main difference between Semrush and Ahrefs is the metrics they focus on. For example, if your primary focus will be analyzing the technical side of SEO (website health e.g.) and doing keyword research, then Semrush is your ideal option. On the other hand, Ahrefs is more suitable for digital marketers that spend more time on link building and searching for backlink opportunities. If you want more in-depth comparisons between the features of these two tools, you can check out Semrush vs Ahrefs comparison post. Most Powerful Semrush Features for Improving Your Search Rankings Now that you know what exactly Semrush is and how it works, we can move on to the specific features that you can use to improve your overall search rankings. Semrush provides users with dozens of features, but picking out the best ones might be a bit complicated if you are new to the software. After talking to some of the leading digital marketers in the industry and conducting our original research, we came up with a list of those that stand out as the most useful for search ranking improvement. Position Tracking On-Page SEO Checker SEO Content Template Organic Traffic Insights Site Audit Keyword Magic Tool Keyword Gap Analysis Keyword Overview Keyword Alert Keyword Tagging Domain Overview Traffic Analytics Link Building Project Dashboard Position Tracking Position tracking is widely known as Semrush’s most powerful feature. You can use it to check out the daily rankings of a website based on a custom group of target keywords. With all the different reports (tagging, sorting, filtering, exporting, etc.), you will acquire the data needed to analyze SEO and PPC performances. Some of the key things that position tracking provides are: Keyword and domain tracking Geographic location comparisons Project device types Discovery of local competitors and their SEO tracking Featured Snippet reports (great for finding featured snippet opportunities) “One of the most powerful Semrush features to improve your search rankings is Position Tracking,” says Sophie Burke of Bead the Change. “This will help you: track your positions for any keyword, discover local competitors, and group your keywords with tags.” Related: The 23 Best Keyword Tracking Tools (According to 107 SEOs) On-Page SEO Checker The On-Page SEO Checker feature provides users with a list of things they can do to enhance their website’s pages search rankings. This list includes keyword recommendations, ideas for optimizing on-page SEO, backlink probability, target content length, and much more. All of these recommendations are based on the target keyword analysis of the biggest real-time competitors in your specific niche. Jakub Rudnik of Shortlister said, “For improving rankings, no tool is more important than the On-Page SEO Checker tool. Creating the best content and the best-optimized content is the most effective way to improve rankings. Getting an analysis of your pages versus their competitors with actionable steps to improve your content is crucial.” Related: Blog SEO: 47 Expert Tips for Optimizing Blog Posts for SEO SEO Content Template This feature is great for content writers who need a little help creating SEO content.

If you can use this information when creating your content it goes a long way towards crafting content that will rank well.” Related: How to Write a Blog Post Outline: Write Better Blogs with These 21 Tactics Organic Traffic Insights “The Organic Traffic Insights tool is fantastic for finding quick-win opportunities,” says Sam Thomas of Embryo Digital. “Outside of your core keyword focus areas, you can find low-hanging fruit which is already driving small amounts of traffic, but with a little focus, could drastically increase the overall search rankings of a website with less resource than the typical high competition keywords. Both are important, but it’s a nice win for the client.” The Organic Traffic Insights feature provides users with a comprehensive dashboard that includes data from your Google Search Console, Google Analytics, and Semrush account. This dashboard includes a handful of important information such as sessions, click-through rate, organic keyword volume, rankings from Semrush, rankings from Google Search Console, and much more. You can use this information to figure out which keywords GA didn’t provide and cross-reference the different data sources. Once you are finished, you will see the big picture behind the organic search performance of your website. Site Audit One of the best ways to get an estimate of your website’s health is by using Semrush’s Site Audit feature. This feature provides you with a categorized list of problems that explains in which areas your website is underperforming. Once you fix the issues in the list, you will enhance your website’s SEO efficiency. The technical analysis covers everything from duplicate content and broken links to crawlability and HTTPS implementation. To explain the importance of the Site Audit feature, here is one of the quotes we acquired when talking to the leading digital marketers. Will C of ProLightingRental – Event Light Rental eCommerce Store said, “One of the most important features that my team relies on at ProLightingRental.com is the site auditing tool. This tool is fantastic for websites with a ton of custom coding and bespoke infrastructure. As a codebase becomes more complex, there can be a host of issues that can arise when you apply a new feature or even patch an existing bug. Many of these issues can be to the detriment of the SEO of your site. Therefore, after every deployment – I run the site auditing functionality feature to ensure there is no damage to any SEO-related infrastructure like (but not limited to) content, layout, canonicals, metadata. On more than one occasion, I have been able to catch issues and therefore minimize any SEO ramifications due to deployments that were not QA’ed efficiently enough.” Related: How to Conduct a DIY Technical SEO Audit: Start with These 17 Questions Keyword Magic Tool The Keyword Magic Tool is probably the most popular tool on Semrush for conducting keyword research. You can use it to analyze specific niche topics, track semantically related keywords, and find which keywords could improve your website’s overall SEO. With more than 20 billion keywords in Semrush’s database, this feature provides you with a comprehensive table that includes specific subgroups categorized by similar search terms. “I am a huge fan of Semrush’s Keyword Magic tool,” says Blake Taylor of Synergy Business Brokers. “This tool is one of the most comprehensive keyword research tools on the market and makes identifying keyword opportunities easy. They also include a competition score, so you can get a good sense of what keyword opportunities to pursue that don’t have a ton of competition.” Keyword Gap Analysis You can use Keyword Gap Analysis to acquire a detailed comparison of keyword profiles of your top five competitors. By entering the domain and keyword ranking type, you will see the best opportunities for each individual website, how many keywords overlap, which keywords can be found on all of the five websites, and more. This type of data can be helpful when making SEO strategies and campaigns since you will have an insight into which niche keywords are trending in real-time. Once you know what your competitors are doing, you will know which SEO efforts to prioritize. Also, this analysis will provide you with keywords that are unique for your specific domain, thereby uncovering keyword gaps in your competitor’s campaigns. “Semrush’s Keyword Gap feature is incredibly useful for identifying keywords that websites similar to yours rank for – especially because you can filter it to only keywords containing a certain phrase, or only those above a certain search volume,” says Dan Rawley of Twinkl Educational Publishing. “This allows you to easily build a list of the most valuable terms to target.” Keyword Overview Keyword Overview feature is used for acquiring information regarding the search volume of a specific keyword, result number, intent, CPC, level of competition, estimated value, and more. This tool is especially helpful for beginner digital marketers that want to start their keyword research journey and find which terms they should target to attract more traffic. Jonathan Aufray of Growth Hackers Agency said, “The most powerful Semrush feature to track and improve your search rankings is finding keywords where your website ranks on the 2nd page of Google. Once you find these pages and keywords, go to your page, add the keywords in H2, H3 tags as well as in the copy of your post. You can also link to that page from other pages of your website through internal linking with the right anchor text. Your pages will move up to the 1st page of Google searches shortly. Don’t forget to always write for readers and for your audience, not for search engines. Therefore, when you add keywords to your content, make sure it’s relevant and makes sense. You don’t want to do keyword stuffing because this will hurt your user experience and readability of your posts.” Keyword Alert For the longest time, digital marketers had to manually check which keywords had gone up or down in rankings in the past few weeks, which is extremely time-consuming. The Keyword Alert tool solved this issue by providing users with an advanced alert system that informs them on all the latest changes regarding their rankings. Whenever there is a change in a keyword ranking in your report, Semrush alerts you via email. “The Alerts feature is helpful for quickly spotting when keywords drop a certain number of positions or fall outside the top 10,” says Robbie Richards. “With this insight, you can quickly identify the cause, and get to work recovering the rankings you worked so hard to achieve.” Keyword Tagging The Keyword Tagging tool is used for tracking the growth metrics of your specific tag groups. This includes visibility percentage, traffic estimates, average position, and share of voice. This feature is great for analyzing how well your tagged keywords are doing in terms of visibility. Side note: you can only use this feature if you apply for the Guru or Business Semrush subscription. “The ability to tag keywords is a powerful feature that allows us to quickly see performance changes for groups of keywords,” says Bruce Hogan of SoftwarePundit. “We add multiple tags for all our keywords when they are uploaded. Then, each team member enters their tags into Semrush to get a view of recent search performance.” Domain Overview This feature allows you to quickly acquire information about your website’s online presence through a wide range of overview metrics. Some of the things you will see include paid search traffic, organic search traffic, backlinks, and more. After receiving the overview, you can further analyze the data by opening up the module-specific reports. The Domain Overview tool is great for figuring out the strengths and weaknesses of your top competitors and quickly assessing which areas you should optimize on your website. Here is a quote from one of the digital marketers that we talked to that explains just how important the Domain Overview feature is. “Domain Overview,” says Seb Atkinson of Know Your Money. “This tool is a great way to keep tabs on competitor activity, uncovering their top pages and top organic keywords. Domain Overview is a perfect starting point for competitor analysis. Starting with keyword ranking data, the tool also brings in link data to identify how various pieces of content are being promoted. Furthermore, data can be exported and used alongside other Semrush modules such as Site Audit, to reverse-engineer a competitor’s strategy and learn how their technical set-up, content, and promotional activity combine to produce their search visibility. By monitoring a range of competitors, you can get a feel for the top trends in your industry, helping to ensure your brand also has a presence for topics that rivals are being found for online. On the flip side, you can keep tabs on any competitor initiatives that may not be yielding the best results, helping you to learn from others’ mistakes and improve the chances of succeeding where others have failed.” Traffic Analytics Traffic Analytics feature is essentially an advanced market research tool that estimates the desktop and mobile traffic of your website. You can use this tool to analyze the potential of a new market and create an efficient media buying plan. The main benefit of this feature is that you will see where exactly your traffic is coming from, how your visitors engage with the website, and which devices they most commonly use. Traffic Analytics is extremely helpful for professional marketing managers, researchers, and sales teams. One of the most popular metrics in this feature is the traffic percentage metric and here is what one of the marketers had to say about it. “For us, traffic % is a metric we use daily,” says Julien Raby of Thermo Gears. “It basically computes the estimated volume for a keyword and our current ranking to give us an estimated traffic volume for each keyword. While the exact numbers are usually off, we like to look at trends to see if we’re gaining volume or not in certain keywords categories.” Link Building The Link Building feature is great for users who are searching for new link-building opportunities within their niche. Also, you will acquire an advanced interface that you can use to create an outreach campaign to attract backlinks. There are four different tools within the feature, these include: Backlink Analytics Backlink Audit Link Building Tool Bulk Analysis Ashley Sterling of The Loop Marketing adds, “Our team focuses on the link building/backlink tools provided by Semrush. This tool allows for daily reports on changes, alerts to potential toxic links, and the ability to perform outreach to link prospects.” Project Dashboard The Project Dashboard provides you with a summarized view of all the most important data and information you generated through Semrush. You can connect your current projects and the dashboard will generate the widgets of data from the other features, allowing you to acquire the big picture of your project’s performance. Jordan McCreery of Ingrained Media says, “The MOST powerful Semrush feature that I rely on daily for tracking and improving client search rankings is the Project Dashboard. Semrush is FULL of amazing tools, the Project Dashboard helps you to visualize all of the data in a summarized area. Your Site Health is shown through Site Audit, Position Tracking monitors your keyword changes, while the Organic Traffic Insights give a big picture of the total traffic in the period.” Semrush Metrics: How to Track & Visualize Your Semrush Data in Databox We have added over 50 new Semrush metrics to our metrics library.

Free Semrush Dashboard Templates When it comes to the variety of SEO features, there aren’t many tools out there that can compare to Semrush. Semrush offers 50+ research and analytics tools to its users and while you will be able to acquire an abundance of data related to your SEO efforts, you will have to spend a lot of time tracking the changes. For example, you will have to log in to your Semrush account each week to check out which keywords are dragging the traffic up/down or see which backlinks got broken. This is why many users choose dashboards as an extra form of help. Dashboards allow you to connect specific metrics in one place and track organic traffic in real-time, all in a single report. Here are some free dashboard templates that you can integrate with your Semrush account. Semrush Keyword Milestones Dashboard Semrush Site Audit Dashboard Semrush Keywords and Audits Dashboard Semrush Keyword Mission Control Dashboard Blog Traffic Distribution Dashboard Semrush Keyword Milestones Dashboard The problem it solves: There is a steep drop-off in click rates for content that does not rank in the top 10 results for valuable search terms. According to a study from Advanced Web Ranking, 71% of all searches lead to a click on a page one result on Google. Even more dramatically, 55% of searches result in a click on one of the first three results! So, marketers can see a big bump in traffic if they can get a high-traffic keyword from position 11 to position 10. And, they should see exponentially better results as their content gets closer to position 1. Semrush uses a relative metric called “Visibility %” to summarize all your rankings. Since lower keywords are less visible on search engine result pages (SERPs), Semrush give you an estimate relative to your specific keywords. The higher your keyword rankings go, the higher the visibility percentage. How to use the Semrush Keyword Milestones Dashboard: The left column tracks all top 3 and top 10 keywords related to your domain. This allows you to track your general SEO success since these determine visibility. The middle column looks at the specific terms where you rank highly. If you rank in the top 3 (or number 1) for a well-trafficked term, you should go into Semrush to see which page is responsible for that high ranking. The last column aligns visibility with organic traffic from Google Analytics. This is the ‘results’ column. When your visibility percentage goes up, you should see a rise in organic traffic as searchers actually click your links. Questions it can answer: Which keywords are important for organic traffic? How does organic traffic change when a keyword crosses a milestone? Are your page titles attracting clicks? Metrics tracked: Number of Top 3 Keywords, Daily Number of Top 10 Keywords, Daily Keywords Ordered by Ranking Movement Visibility % on SERP Organic Traffic by Sessions semrush-keyword-dashboard Semrush Site Audit Dashboard The problem it solves: Semrush created a Site Audit Score to summarize all the different warnings and errors it finds. Although it ranges from 0-100%, there is no specific score that every site should aim for. The more pages you have, the more errors and warnings you will have. If you need a benchmark, use the tool on your competitors and see how you compare! Pages Crawled gives you a baseline for all the pages that the crawler bot can find. Unless you recently took down pages on purpose, you do not want this number to trend downwards! That means errors are piling up. How to use the Semrush audit dashboard: Use this dashboard to communicate your domain’s crawlability as well as any errors you accumulate. Errors are the most severe red flag, followed by warnings and then notices. You can use the crawl depth stats to make sure that most pages are three or less clicks away from the root. Those are the easiest to crawl. Questions it can answer: Are you successfully eliminating toxic backlinks? Is your site map easy to crawl? Are you keeping warnings, errors, and notices in control as you grow? Metrics tracked: Site Audit Score (%) Pages with Issues, Warnings, Errors, Notices Pages Crawled 1 Click, 2 Clicks, 3 Clicks, 4+ Clicks semrush-site-audit Semrush Keywords and Audits Dashboard The problem it solves: This dashboard examines all the key domain statistics provided by Semrush. It factors in both positive stats like keyword ranking, and negative stats, like errors that affect your domain authority and crawlability. Estimated traffic is Semrush’s internal metric that multiplies the volume of searches for each term by the click-through rate of that particular position. How to use the Semrush Keywords and Audits dashboard: Make sure that any hard work on content marketing is supported by a clean, crawlable site. You do not want to put hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars into content marketing simply to be handcuffed by an uncrawlable site. Questions it can answer: How visible is your domain? What are your top keywords? Are you cleaning up errors, warnings and notices? Does your SEO work increase traffic? Metrics tracked: Visibility Trend Estimated Traffic Top Keywords by Position Links with Errors Site Audit Results semrush-keywords-audits Semrush Keyword Mission Control Dashboard The problem it solves: This dashboard gives an overview of all stats related to keywords. It measures the percentage of your site’s traffic that comes from organic sources in the first place. Then, it covers all your organic traffic initiatives, from keywords to visibility to estimated traffic. How to use the Semrush Keyword Mission Control dashboard: This gives a general overview of your success in generating organic traffic. You can use it to align keyword metrics alongside traffic metrics. If you are successfully ranking highly for more keywords, organic traffic should go up. If it does not, you may want to check your Site Audit. Questions it can answer: How does high-ranking content translate to organic traffic? How well are you competing for specific terms? Metrics tracked: Keywords by Position, Volume, and % Change Ranking Distribution Visibility Trend Top Channels by Sessions semrush-keyword-mission-control Blog Traffic Distribution Dashboard The problem it solves: According to our study, 3% of blog posts drive 80% of total blog traffic. And just 0.5% of posts drive 50% of traffic. So, even as your organic traffic builds over many months, you will continue to rely on your top 0.5% of posts. You can use these posts to decide where to focus your content production. Or, you can update/optimize these top posts with better CTAs to drive more leads or product sign-ups. How to use the Blog Traffic Distribution dashboard: The left column ranks your blog posts based on organic traffic, and shows which posts are rising or falling in search rankings based on changes in traffic. The middle column clearly shows which posts make up a majority of traffic for the entire blog. In the case above, 3 posts make up 60% of traffic! The right column tracks all organic search traffic and the keywords that drive it. Questions it can answer: Which posts should undergo historical optimization? Which keywords drive the most traffic? Does your blogging strategy focus on high-performing topics? Metrics tracked: Top Keywords by Position Top Blog Posts by Sessions, Monthly Organic Search Traffic, Daily organic-blog-traffic-dashboard Easily Monitor and Report Your SEO Data with Databox With Google constantly making changes to its algorithm and updating its technology, staying on top of your SEO strategy can be a daunting task – even for the most experienced digital marketers.

Take a look at what your competitors are doing to see where you can improve. SEMrush presents easy-to-read data and graphs on organic search traffic, paid search traffic, backlinks, and display ads for the domain you enter. 2. Position Tracker Position tracking is one of our favorite tools from SEMrush! Compose a list of your most important keywords, which are the products or services you offer, so that you can increase your ranking on the first page of Google. It is important to select desktop or mobile, as well as your service area – this could be a country, state, city, or even a zip code.

With this tool, we can see which keywords need optimization and how any SEO changes affect the website. 3. Analysis of traffic flows Furthermore, it is important to evaluate how your website performs for each keyword as well as what page of Google shows up for each. Where are your visitors coming from and how are they finding your website? SEMrush’s traffic analytics tool allows you to see how many visitors you had to your site over a specified period of time. Furthermore, you will be able to see average statistics for how many pages a user viewed each time and how long they stayed on the site. In addition to displaying trends by device, you can also view them based on traffic sources. 4.

START YOUR SEMRUSH FREE TRIAL NOW ➜ Does SEMrush offer a free version? Despite having a free version, SEMrush comes with limited features and services. A free account allows you to: Set up and manage one SEMrush project There are 10 daily inquiries about keyword/competitor research Tracking keywords (10 keywords maximum) Take a look at 100 pages of your website Nevertheless, the free version does not provide beginners in digital marketing with nearly as many flexibility and benefits as the paid version.

Big brands who need more flexibility and customization can also choose enterprise plans SEMrush vs. Google Analytics: How Do They Different? In the world of internet marketing, SEMrush and Google Analytics are currently the most popular tools. While both offer similar services, they operate in different ways.Since it’s not possible for you to get the internal data of your competitor’s website, the data you get from SEMrush is almost as good as what you get from them. SEMrush vs Ahrefs: what’s the difference? As an SEO tool that analyzes competitors’ sites externally, Ahrefs compares more to SEMrush than Google Analytics. Currently, both of these tools are pretty similar in their features and services, but this wasn’t always the case. Ahrefs was initially only known for its backlink analysis capabilities. The company has nevertheless added a number of new features since then, making it a rival worth considering in the SEO research market. The metrics that SEMrush and Ahrefs focus on are significantly different. If you’re mostly interested in doing keyword research and analyzing the technical side of SEO (e.g., website health), then SEMrush is the right tool for you. In contrast, Ahrefs is perfect for digital marketers who spend more time researching backlinks and building links. SEMrush’s Powerful Features Will Help You Rank Higher You can use specific features to improve your search ranking after you understand what SEMrush is and how it works. There are a number of features in SEMrush, but if you are unfamiliar with the software, it can be difficult to decide which ones to use.

From here you can: segment keywords further for analysis export them to a spreadsheet send them to other tools like the position tracking tool. semrush keyword analyzer tool-min Position Tracking tool Once you've figured out the keywords you really want to track (whether you already have pages targeting them or you're planning on creating some), you'll want to add them to the position tracking tool. Here you get weekly updates on how you and your competitors are ranking for those keywords. Another really cool feature is it will show you all the various SERP Features the keyword is triggering and who has those SERP Features. You can review the specific pages you are ranking for those keywords to see if they need improvement. You can stalk your competitors' landing pages to see what they're doing to help you get new ideas for your pages. And one of my favorite features of the Position Tracking tool, especially if you're a local business, is you can Geo target those keywords to see how you're doing at a local search level rather than rely on your national rankings. semrush position tracking tool-min Domain Overview tool With SEMrush, you don’t have to stop at researching new keywords. You can also learn a ton of information about your own website including keywords you already rank for. Oftentimes, you may not even realize some of the keywords that are bringing traffic to your site, or the volume of traffic those keywords are bringing you. To gather information about your own domain, simply enter your root domain into the Domain Overview tool. semrush domain overview tool-min ­ Before moving on, one thing that should be noted is that in SEMrush’s domain overview of a site, where it shows your monthly traffic, those numbers do not accurately reflect your site’s total monthly traffic. Rather, it’s giving organic and paid search traffic from keywords that SEMrush has in its database of 120 million keywords. They use an algorithm to estimate your monthly traffic based on number of keywords, position of keywords, and average CTR of those keywords. Your website traffic may be much higher when you calculate in direct traffic, social media traffic, and traffic from email campaigns. With that said, let’s take a look at some of the amazing metrics SEMrush can offer in their domain search when you type in your website address: An overview of the amount of traffic that keywords known to SEMrush are bringing to your site through organic traffic. The amount of traffic you might be bringing in with paid search. Number of backlinks from referring domains Visual representations of sources for organic and paid keywords. A graph showing traffic by organic and paid sources over time (can choose 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or all time). The top 5 organic keywords that are bringing traffic to your site. You can click into this section for a ton more analytics (more on these metrics below). A graph showcasing organic position distribution, e.g., how many of your keywords rank in the top 3, how many rank in positions 4-10, 11-20, etc. up to the top 100 results. Who, based on traffic and overlapping keywords, are your top organic competitors. Many of the competitors listed may not even be ones you knew about. More on the organic competitors later. A graph showcasing a competitive position map based on number of keywords and organic search traffic A chart showing the top paid keywords bringing traffic to the site (can be expanded to view a full report for more metrics A graph showing paid position distribution of the keyword ads you target. A chart showing your main paid competitors (top 5 are displayed. More info can be gathered by clicking into the chart). A graph showing your competitive positioning map relative to how many paid keywords you, and your competitors are targeting as well as traffic brought in from PPC keywords. A sampling of some of your PPC ads Some of the backlinks that refer to your site, what those sites are and the anchor text and URL that those backlinks link to. The top anchor texts used in backlinks bringing referring traffic to your site. Referring domains that are driving traffic to your site sorted by those with the most backlinks pointing to your webpages. You most popular indexed pages that are back-linked by other domains. And remember, all of this information is just an overview of the metrics. To learn more about each set of data, you simply click on whatever metrics interest you to view full reports. While we’re not going to get into every possible metric point (we don’t want to spoil your future exploration with SEMrush), we will discuss some of those that we use most frequently. Organic Research tool In the Organic Research tool you can learn a lot about the keywords you, or your competitors, currently rank for. In the Overview tab, you get a nice graph showing your keyword growth over time. You can change this graph to show all top 10 page results, top 5 page results, top two page results, first page results, and even top three results. organic research overview In the Positions tab, you get a complete table of ALL the keywords you currently rank for in the top 100 results. organic research positions-min Here we can see a full set of keywords that SEMrush has information on that is bringing traffic to a website. By default, SEMrush lists the keywords in order of those bringing the highest volume of monthly traffic. However, other data points can be used to sort the keywords such as: Position the keyword has for organic search results with an arrow showing the previous position. The difference in position gains or losses compared to the last crawl. The estimated number of monthly searches for that keyword. The Cost Per Click to advertise for the keyword. The URL page the keyword is associated with. The CPC average. The competitive density of the keyword for those wishing to advertise for it. The total number of indexed URL’s that contain the keyword Trends over time by popularity of searches The SERP, or snapshot of the first page of results in a search engine. And when the keyword’s data was last updated. Note: It can take SEMrush several weeks to recrawl a keyword in this tool. If you're looking for more up-to-date information, move the keyword to the Position Tracking tool. Checking out this feature is a great way to see exactly the keywords that are bringing you traffic, and how much of your total traffic they’re bringing. Oftentimes you may even find keywords that are performing very strongly for your site that you were not previously aware of, allowing you to retarget those keywords for better efficiency. Keyword Gap tool Another awesome tool found within Domain Overview is the Keyword Gap tool. ­ The Keyword Gap tool really helps you see how your website stacks up against others in your space that are targeting some of the same keywords as you. semrush keyword gap tool-min You can enter up to five websites at a time, but I recommend it's best to start with head-to-heads of your website vs a top competitor. What you'll get with the Keyword Gap tool is (by default) a list of keywords both you and your competitor(s) have in common. You'll get to see your ranking for the keyword vs their ranking. You'll also get information like volume, difficulty to rank for, CPC, and Adwords competition. Another way to use the tool is to change the Venn Diagram between the websites so you can look at keywords your competitor has that you don't rank for at all. Use the Keyword Gap tool to find keywords you rank for below your competitor and make changes to those pages to improve your rankings. Or look for keywords they have that you don't and scrape for new content ideas. Website review tools If you're wanting to know how well your website and website copy is performing, SEMrush has a whole suite of tools for these kinds of metrics. Site Audit tool As if being able to check out all of your keywords, your competitors' keywords, and the amount of traffic you’re bringing in isn’t enough, you can also run a site audit in SEMrush to see if there’s any problems occurring with your site that may hinder it’s performance. semrush site audit-min In the image above we can see a client of ours' website is scoring a pretty decent 79%. But that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement. We've got at least 6 errors, 388 warnings, and 1,245 notices we can review to improve performance. Backlinks Analytics tool Backlinks are still one of the most important signals to search engines to help them determine the quality of pages. While the copy itself is still the most important metric, search engines look to see how other people and websites feel about the quality of the content. Think about it, you wouldn't link to a page that held zero value for your audience to follow. Why would you send them somewhere that didn't help them further. Instead, you'd link to high-quality content that would be valuable for them to read. In the Backlink Analytics tool, you can review the total backlinks to your (or a competitors website), which pages are being linked to, where those links are coming from, and how your total backlinks are growing over time. semrush backlink analytics-min Remember, you can also use this tool to check out where your competitors are getting links from and use these as opportunities for outreach. Backlink Audit tool So now that you know how many backlinks you have and which domains are linking to your pages, how well can you trust those links? Are they from reputable sources? Do you have a bunch of links from toxic sources pointing to your website? Even though you may have not created the incoming link yourself, too many toxic backlinks that haven't been disavowed makes Google think you don't practice good housekeeping. Toxic backlinks can hurt the reputation of your own site, so you'll want to review your backlinks and disavow highly toxic links. Use the Backlink Audit tool to comb through your list of toxic backlinks. semrush backlink audit tool-min Rating for SEMrush All in all, SEMrush is an amazing tool that can provide an overabundance of information for anyone looking to optimize their website, find the most profitable keywords to target, and/or uncover loads of information about their competitors. From what we’ve studied (and hopefully you can now see for yourself) SEMrush is easily the best SEO keywords tool available on the market right based on the immense amount of information and metrics available for view. However, SEMrush may not be best for the casual user as it can take quite a bit of time getting comfortable with finding all of the useful data one can compile to improve their site and keyword strategy. Fortunately, SEMrush offers tons of resources in the forms of whitepapers, a comprehensive FAQ page, video tutorials, and regular webinars for users of all skill levels. And their support team offers detailed, helpful answers in a timely manner. For us here at IMPACT, we easily give this amazing tool 5 out of 5 stars and will be using it for ourselves, recommending it to our clients, and recommending it to anybody who asks us about it. It really is that awesome. With all of that said, there is still one question to address... How much does SEMrush cost? With SEMrush there are different plans to consider depending on the size and scope of your SEO keyword strategy you wish to implement. semrush pricing plans SEMrush Pro: $99.95/month Includes: 10,000 results per report 3,000 reports per day 5 projects 500 keywords to track 100,000 pages to crawl 5 scheduled PDF reports SEMrush Guru: $199.95/month Includes: 30,000 results per report 5,000 reports per day 50 projects 1,500 keywords to track 300,000 pages to crawl 20 scheduled PDF reports Branded PDF reports Access to historical data SEMrush Business: $399.95/month Includes: 50,000 results per report (for each of 4 users) 10,000 reports per day (for each of 4 users) 200 Projects 5,000 keywords to track (1,500 per user) 1,000,000 pages to crawl (300,000 per user) 50 scheduled PDF reports (for each of 4 users) Branded PDF reports Access to historical data Product listing ads Multi-user management",SemRush

Here are different ways to use SEMrush to get SEO data Find all of a website’s rankings Enter the root domain into SEMrush’s search bar. Do not include “http://” or “www.” else SEMrush will default to rankings for that specific page (more on this in a bit). Click on the Organic Research sidebar, which defaults to the ‘Positions’ submenu. Scroll down to “Organic Search Positions” where you’ll see a comprehensive list of keywords, their search volumes, which of your pages rank and in what position (plus other relevant details). Find all of a subdomain’s rankings Start with the same process as above. Under “Organic Search Positions” create a filter. To find out what pages on rcs.seerinteractive.com, a sub-domain of our main website, are ranking, we’ll select Include > URL > Containing > rcs.seerinteractive.com You could also create the filter Include > URL > Begins with > rcs. This would be less specific, but helpful if you wanted to find rankings for multiple subdomains that began with the same string of text. If your blog is located by itself on a subdomain, this is how you can find where your blog pages rank. CLICK HERE to try it for 7 days so that you can see the results for yourself. Find all of a specific page’s rankings In the search bar, enter the full page URL, including the HTTP prefix. SEMrush will recognize that you’ve entered a page URL and only show keywords/rankings for that URL. Find rankings for all URLs with a specific word/phrase in them Let’s say you want to find all URLs with a specific word in them, such as “seo.” Create the filter: Include > URL > Containing > seo If you have multiple subfolders across different URL structures, you can use this method to find their rankings. Say you have seerinteractive.com/philly/seo/ and seerinteractive.com/san-diego/seo/ and you want to find rankings for pages in those seo subfolders, but you don’t want to include pages outside those folders that might have seo in the URL (such as seerinteractive.com/blog/seo-tips/). Create the filter: Include > URL > Containing > /seo/ Find all this information in another country What’s VERY cool about SEMrush is that for international SEO, you can find any of this information for different Google databases. Up top, select one of 28 different countries to see different results. CLICK HERE to try it for 7 days so that you can see the results for yourself. Find a site’s estimated organic traffic history SEMrush will show you a site ’s estimated organic traffic based on rankings, but I take this metric with a grain of salt. It is, at best, an approximation given the available data and should be treated as such. You can use this to evaluate a competitor’s potential traffic, but it’s more useful in terms of traffic trends – a big drop could indicate that a site was affected by an algorithm change. Gains could suggest that a site has put greater emphasis on their SEO efforts or launched new campaigns to rank higher or rank for more keywords. Find rankings for a specific keyword Type your desired keyword into the search bar up top and SEMrush will present detailed information about that keyword, including results 1-100. Find keyword suggestions for keyword research Type your starting keyword into the search bar, scroll down to the “Phrase Match Keywords” section and click “View full report.” This will show you other keywords containing the keyword you entered. This is by no means highly conclusive but can give you a good starting point. CLICK HERE to try it for 7 days so that you can see the results for yourself. Find keywords with a specific number of search results This is probably one of SEMrush’s least used features, but it’s easy to find keywords with a certain number of total search results. Create the filter: Include > Results > (Greater than|Less than|Equal) > 6,000,000 (or whatever number you want). Find keywords with/without a specific word in them Similar to URL, you can filter by keyword contents. You might want to find where a site ranks for queries containing the keyword “seo.” Create the filter: Include > Keyword > Word matching > seo. This ensures the results will only include strings where “seo” is present as its own word, and not as part of another word. If you want to be less specific, you can create the filter: Include > Keyword > Containing > seo. Other options include “Begins with” and “Ends with” CLICK HERE to try it for 7 days so that you can see the results for yourself. Find out who your competitors are By selecting the “Competitors” tab under “Organic Research” you can find all kinds of information about search competitors. If you’ve done your due diligence, you probably already know who a site’s competitors are. A college for example, might say “our competitors are University X, University Y and University Z.” That’s great, and you could compare just those four sites, but looking at competitor data from SEMrush might also reveal that non-university websites such as U.S. News & World Report rank highly for education-related keywords. SEMrush will provide such data as: What other websites share common keywords. The percentage (and raw number) of keywords these other sites have in common. The total number of keywords other competitors rank for (including non-mutual keywords). Clicking on any of these results will take you to SEMrush’s Domain vs. Domain analysis tool. Compare rankings for 5 domains at once If you want to compare a website’s rankings to that of its competitors, Domain vs. Domain makes it very easy. This varies from the “Competitors” tab in that it allows you to select specific domains to compare. CLICK HERE to try it for 7 days so that you can see the results for yourself. First make sure you’ve selected “Advanced Mode” otherwise you’re limited to 3 domains. Next, enter the different domains into each box and click “Go.” SEMrush will essentially perform a very basic gap analysis, identifying keywords where all of the domains rank, and reporting on what position each domain ranks in. It does not, however, tell you what URL is ranking for each domain, which makes it difficult to manually compare pages. In order to get a more in-depth look, you can still use SEMrush but will need to export rankings for each of the domains and use spreadsheets and VLOOKUP to compare URLs. Find all backlinks to an entire site (root domain, including all subdomains) Enter a site’s root domain into the search box and make sure the Root Domain box is selected below the search box. SEMrush will default to a snapshot overview page but by selecting the Backlinks submenu on the Backlinks sidebar you can see a full list of backlinks. This list operates similar to the Positions database and will find all of the backlinks to the root domain that SEMrush has in its index. Find all backlinks to a domain (excluding all subdomains) By selecting the Domain box below the search bar, you can instruct SEMrush to exclude all subdomain backlinks. A word of caution: this will exclude backlinks to www. pages (since www. is a technically a subdomain). CLICK HERE to try it for 7 days so that you can see the results for yourself. Find all backlinks to a specific subdomain If you want to look at to a specific n subdomain, select the Domain box and enter that subdomain into the search bar. Do not include the HTTP header or SEMrush will default to backlinks for that specific page. Find all backlinks to a specific URL Enter a specific page URL into the search bar. Including the HTTP header will instruct SEMrush to look at page-specific metrics. CLICK HERE to try it for 7 days so that you can see the results for yourself. Find how many other internal/external links (to any site/page) are on a source URL Within its list of backlinks, an interesting metric SEMrush provides is the number of internal and external links present on the source URL. A high volume of external links could be an indicator that the site is low-quality or directory-focused. Find the estimated age of a backlink A common obstacle with backlink indexes is that they’re sometimes out of date. The First Seen and Last Seen columns can be useful to determine the estimated age of a backlink, although it’s still wise to use Screaming Frog’s custom search feature to crawl a list of backlink source pages and see if they’re still present. Grab your 2 weeks Free trial of SEMRUSH CLICK HERE to try it for 7 days so that you can see the results for yourself. In line with reviews and guide, we give SEMrush a thumbsup. Its capabilities as a keyword tool are intense, but it goes above and beyond. Social listening, backlink auditing, and best of all, competitor insights make it easy to increase our clients’ web presence and put them a step ahead of their competitors.",SemRush
Sales Marketing,"What Is a Marketing Strategy? A marketing strategy is an overarching guide to how your business positions and promotes itself to prospects and customers to reach your company goals. Consider it the roadmap that outlines your business’s fundamental approach to engaging with your audience, communicating your values (and value proposition), and driving sales. And your marketing strategy should be: Clear Concise Specific Long-term Pro tip ​​​​​ Document your marketing strategy in writing and share a copy with your team for easy reference. Marketing Strategy vs. Marketing Plan: What’s the Difference? The terms “marketing strategy” and “marketing plan” often get mixed up. Here’s why: They’re closely related concepts that both inform your marketing activities. Marketing strategy definition: The big-picture vision for how you’ll achieve your business’s goals. It sets the stage for how you’ll position your brand, who you’ll target, and the brand values you’ll uphold. Marketing plan definition: The step-by-step details outlining how you’ll bring your marketing strategy to life. It focuses on specific processes, tools, and tactics needed to reach your business goals. An infographic comparing marketing strategy and marketing plan definitions For example: A new energy drink company does extensive research and identifies pickleball players as its ideal customers. And a market segment that’s projected to grow. Then, the company formulates a marketing strategy focused on appealing to those players by promoting the idea of playfulness, having fun, and not taking life too seriously. From there, they develop a marketing plan that details how they’ll execute their strategy. Step by step. Through research and analysis, the team identifies four channels to focus their marketing efforts on that fit within their budget: Social media via Instagram Website via blog posts that use SEO best practices Email via an existing list of subscribers Paid search ads via Google Ads The plan then details the specific actions that will drive their strategy goals. Such as: Hire video creators to produce funny videos of people playing other sports with pickles as substitutes for traditional balls. Then, post the content on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok to connect with audiences and influencers on those platforms. Employ freelance writers to create blog articles optimized for keywords that pickleball players would likely search for. And write email marketing campaigns that include links to these new articles. Contract with a pay-per-click (PPC) ads expert to develop a paid search campaign for keywords related to enhancing pickleball player performance Get the idea? Both the strategy and the plan are crucial for success. Why Is a Marketing Strategy Important? Having an established (and documented) marketing strategy provides direction that ensures all your activities are unified and working toward the same goal. Without one, you’ll deal with wasted resources, misaligned efforts, and missed opportunities. The power of an effective marketing strategy lies in its ability to: Drive purposeful action: It connects your marketing endeavors with overarching business objectives to ensure each initiative contributes to long-term goals Foster team alignment: A marketing strategy allows all teams to rally behind a shared vision to accelerate growth, enhance sales, and improve customer retention Help measure results: A clear strategy provides a framework for reviewing performance, seeing whether your tactics align, and knowing if they’re driving toward your end goal Tip With the AI Marketing Strategy app, you can access frameworks for goal setting and marketing strategy for every step of the marketing funnel. Plus, you get access to an AI tool that creates copy, graphics, and more, all in one. qyLe7Kn7VuC7Q6gJR91yihXTD_CBSI4lU87LuRJSKPzVAVJ_Cbt_aOHjOpQREMJqEHVzgjZUtto7MNSZksy8qp3sfMFflVMjlD8olUryZPDrymnehbY2UZ6zqJ_BfborSXuPPi0Sp230ncVPQHmIZFM 7 Steps for Creating a Comprehensive Marketing Strategy Whether you’re crafting a marketing strategy and plan for the first time or you want a refresher, it’s helpful to follow these steps. 1. Set Measurable Goals Defining clear marketing goals that contribute to the larger company goals allows you to measure your efforts. And determine whether you’re on track. The SMART framework offers a simple approach to goal setting. It states that goals should be: Specific: Keep goals clear, concise, and detailed. Define exactly what you’re setting out to achieve. Measurable: Set criteria for measuring your goals’ progress and success. Establish the metrics you’ll use to track and evaluate performance. Like number of site visitors, engagement rate, and conversions. Actionable: Ensure clear steps can be taken and determine the workflows and investments necessary to complete your goals. Consider time, budget, and tools. Relevant: Align goals with broader organizational objectives. Such as raising revenue, boosting brand awareness, and increasing customer loyalty. Time-bound: Instill a sense of urgency and stay focused by establishing time frames with clear deadlines. Decide when actions must be taken. And when performance must be measured. An infographic by Semrush listing what SMART marketing goals stand for For example: By applying the SMART framework, you could set a goal of getting 35% more leads through your website pop-ups by the end of Q3. 2. Conduct Market Research and Identify Your Target Audience Doing market research gives you insight into the overall market landscape and who the audience is. Which impacts your marketing strategy. So, where should you begin? Semrush’s Market Explorer allows you to benchmark yourself against your competitors and learn details about target audiences. Open the tool, make sure the “Create List” tab is selected, and enter at least three competitors’ domains. And click “Create and analyze.” ""cuisinart.com,"" ""breville.com"" and ""kitchenaid.com"" entered into Market Explorer search Note ​​​​​​ The location is set to “Worldwide” by default, but you can set it to any country you’d like to refine your market research. You’ll then be taken to the “Overview” report for a high-level look at the market. Including the level of consolidation, the market size, and the total amount of website traffic the market receives. Market Explorer overview report Scroll down to “Domain vs Market Dynamics” to take a closer look at how each competitor stacks up against the larger market. “Domain vs Market Dynamics” section in Market Explorer Now, head to the “Audience” tab.

Determine Your Overall Approach Deciding your overall marketing approach forms the basis of your strategy. Which enables your company to stand out among the competition and connect effectively with your target audience. Once you’ve set goals and completed your groundwork research, gather the stakeholders who will have a say in determining your marketing strategy. Meaning marketing leadership and leaders from sales, finance, and any other teams involved. With your goals set and data gathered from the previous steps, collaborate to decide on a marketing strategy approach that makes sense for your company. Consider evaluating your company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats using a SWOT analysis to help you plan. An infographic on how to do a SWOT analysis Every business will have a different approach to marketing strategy. So, your approach represents a conscious choice and commitment to how you’ll achieve your goals. For example: A small, luxury beauty company knows it won’t be able to compete against big players by outspending them. So, they devise a strategy to emphasize what sets them apart by highlighting their dermatologist founder, clean ingredients, and clinical trial results. To appeal to prospects who are willing to invest in better makeup. With that direction in place, the brand will stay within their marketing budget and can now focus on its messaging, channels, and tactics. 4. Craft Key Brand Messaging A strong brand message shows what your company stands for, why you’re different, and why people should care. And attracts the right people. Start with your tone of voice. Our guide on how to define your brand’s tone of voice walks you through the steps. But here’s a quick overview: Define your core values by creating a mission statement and communication goals (i.e., adjectives that describe your business) Determine your tone of voice by establishing characteristics that define how you want to sound to your target audience (e.g., funny vs. serious, formal vs. casual, respectful vs. irreverent, enthusiastic vs. matter of fact Observe your audience (like on social media) to find out how they interact with your content and how they communicate with each other. This will allow you to tweak your voice based on their preferences. Set clear brand guidelines (like the example from Adobe below) for correct use across channels ""Voice"" section of Adobe's brand guidelines Next, use your brand’s tone of voice and buyer personas to shape your messaging. Which conveys how you’ll communicate with your audience to compel them to become customers. It highlights your company’s value proposition. Which is a concise statement that explains what makes your product or service unique and beneficial compared to competitors. It may also showcase company values, like eco-friendliness, inclusivity, and future-mindedness. An infographic showing what your product/services’s value proposition is Your messaging should touch on vocabulary. Including which words to use frequently and which terms to avoid. It also includes slogans and taglines that help prospects and customers identify your business and what it’s about. Remember—the best brand messaging is: Clear and easy to read and understand Consistent across different marketing channels (to a degree) Captivating to hold people’s attention Connected to people’s values and emotions Convincing enough to compel people to buy Once you’ve sharpened your brand messaging, it’s time to identify which marketing channels and tactics you can use to achieve your strategy. 5. Select Marketing Channels and Tactics Choosing the right marketing channels and tactics is pivotal. Because even well-planned campaigns can miss their goals if they’re broadcast in spaces that don’t align with your audience. Content distribution occurs across three broad channel categories: Owned channels: The channels your brand controls. Like your website, social media profiles, email newsletters, and apps. Earned or shared channels: Third-party channels that share your content or content about your brand. Think guest posts, reviews, and media mentions. Paid channels: Channels that involve paying to promote your brand. Including paid search ads, social ads, sponsored content, or influencer/brand partnerships. An infographic on key types of content distribution channels When crafting a digital marketing strategy, the channels you’ll use depends on your individual business. To see which channels have worked for you well in the past (if your company has been around for a while), head to Google Analytics to gather data. Open the “Traffic acquisition” report to discover which channels are driving traffic to your website. “Traffic acquisition” report in GA4 Some traffic acquisition channels you might see are: Organic search from sources like Google, Bing, and Baidu Organic social from sources like Tiktok, Instagram, and Facebook Direct traffic from people who type your URL directly into their browser Referral traffic from other websites Paid search from pay-per-click search campaigns Email from links in email messages sent to your subscriber list To uncover which channels your competitors are using, head to Market Explorer. Like before, open the tool, select the “Create List” tab. Then, enter at least three competitors’ domains and click “Create and analyze.” In the “Overview” report, scroll down to the “Domain vs Market Dynamics” module toward the bottom. There, you’ll find the “Traffic Generation Strategy” data for all competitors you enter. “Traffic Generation Strategy” section of the report in Market Explorer Then, scroll to the top and click “Audience” and scroll down to glean which social media platforms your competitors’ audiences prefer. ""Social Media"" charts from the ""Audience"" report in Market Explorer Let’s say you discover that YouTube is a priority channel because it’s driving massive amounts of traffic to your competitors.

Establish Your Budget and Timelines Creating a marketing budget that’s aligned with your resources, channels, and tactics is key for putting your plan into action. Start crafting your budget by distributing it across your highest-priority channels and tactics. For example: Say you run a restaurant with a marketing budget of $50,000. Your priority channels are Tiktok, Instagram, and your website. And your main tactics are creating eye-catching photo and video content of your cuisine and chefs, posting that content on your site and social media, and running paid social ads to attract new customers. Break your budget down according to your needs, starting with a photographer and videographer to shoot images and clips. This content is key to achieving your goals, so you allocate $8,000 for these efforts. You also need to hire a web designer to spruce up your website, so you budget up to $5,000 for that. The remaining funds will be divided to meet your writing needs, the cost of campaigns, etc. It’s also a good idea to keep a contingency fund to cover unexpected expenses. Of course, this is just one way to go. Once you’ve determined the numbers, ensure you stay on track and within budget by mapping out timelines. Using the same restaurant example, it would be important to set deadlines for creating photo and video content, completing your website revamp, and finishing your social media calendar. And having clear time constraints in place will keep everyone on track to achieve your goals. 7. Track and Monitor Progress Monitoring your results lets you see what’s performing well and helps you work toward your goals. And determine whether there are optimizations you can make to improve. The tools you’ll use to measure your performance will depend on which channels and tactics you’re leveraging. For example: Google Analytics measures website/blog performance Google Search Console tracks organic search performance Google Ads and other platform-specific analytics monitors ads Another useful measurement method is tracking your site’s organic search rankings with Semrush’s Position Tracking tool. Open the tool, enter your domain, and click “Set up tracking.” Position Tracking tool On the next screen, choose a search engine, device type, language, and your target location. Then, click “Continue To Keywords.” ""Targeting"" window in Position Tracking settings Now, enter a list of keywords you’d like to target. You can enter them manually or import them from a file or other resource. Then, click “Start Tracking.” ""Keywords"" window in Position Tracking settings The tool will then gather data for your target keywords. And you can head to the “Overview” tab to see a dashboard showing where your site currently ranks for them. ""Rankings Overview"" report in Position Tracking tool You can now monitor how your site ranks for each keyword you’re tracking and observe improvements and setbacks as they arise. To track your efforts on social media, try Social Analytics. Which lets you monitor metrics across your Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram accounts. Open the tool and click “+ Add profile” to connect your accounts. Social Analytics tool Follow the prompts in the configuration wizard for each profile. And then head to the “Overview” tab to get a high-level look at your follower growth, engagement, and more across your social accounts. ""Overview"" tab in Social Analytics tool You can also look into the specifics for each profile by clicking on the corresponding tabs. All of these tools simplify tracking so you can take a data-driven approach to the final piece of the marketing strategy puzzle: iteration and optimization. Marketing Strategy for Small Businesses Shaping a marketing strategy for a small business is especially important due to limited resources and the need to rapidly grow. Here’s what small business owners should consider doing on top of the general marketing strategy steps outlined above: Offer personalized customer engagement. Cultivate deeper, personal relationships with your customers. Doing so generates positive word-of-mouth recommendations and online testimonials. Invest in local SEO. Emphasize local search engine optimization (SEO) to ensure that your business stands out in your immediate vicinity. Small businesses thrive on local support, and ensuring you’re visible in local search results and directories is key. Foster community engagement. Get involved in local events, sponsorships, and collaborations. Not only does this bolster local presence, but it also instills a sense of community trust and loyalty.

Sales Marketing,"Content marketing strategy Guide with SEMrush Semrush Semrush · Follow 6 min read · Nov 27, 2017 Until extremely recently in marketing history, when content primarily existed in paper and ink, the process of creating content was simple: all you had to do was write a semi-interesting article and get it printed in the newspaper. There was a downside, though; the lifespan of these articles was short-lived, ending when the newspaper was tossed. There was also no way to know who actually read your article or the impact that it had. It goes without saying that the world of content has been completely revolutionized thanks to the internet, where it can now live on forever. This helps you keep a store of great content on your site, which is a huge plus, but it means that everyone else is keeping their content too; your competition for user attention is higher than ever before. It’s not just enough to have an interesting idea and write about it; you need to consider your specific audience and make it possible for them to find your content and share it. This is called content strategy. What is a Content Marketing Strategy? To fully understand the concept of a concept marketing strategy, we’ll first need to define “content marketing.” Content marketing is a branch of marketing that works by sharing valuable materials online to attract and build relationships with a brand’s target audience. The emphasis in content marketing should never be to just promote your products like a sales pitch, but instead to offer valuable, actionable content that your audience will respond to. Content marketing can help foster relationships with new potential customers, but it can also help capture drive leads and sales, establish you and your brand as an industry authority, improve your credibility, and even help your search engine rankings. Types of content that you can use include: blog posts, videos, images, infographics, ebooks, whitepapers, case studies, guides. An effective content marketing strategy should identify what exact goals you want to reach and how you plan to accomplish them. Do you want more high-value leads? More sales on your e-commerce site, or purchases of a subscription package? A content marketing strategy should identify what exact goals you want to reach and how you plan to accomplish them. Instead of just blindly creating content off interesting ideas, a content marketing strategy will allow you to incorporate long-term strategies that are designed to drive the specific, measurable results you’re looking for. 7 steps to create content marketing strategy A content marketing strategy must be thorough, and while your content should be original and new, creating the actual strategy can — and should — be much more formulaic. To create an incredible content marketing strategy that can reach your audience and get you the results you want, keep reading. Our 7 step approach to developing a content strategy will help you create stronger content that converts more leads, help you accomplish your goals, and make it easier to find your audiences. Step 1. Analyze your niche The first thing you should do is realize where you stand in the niche. It means taking into consideration your strengths and weaknesses, and the value you bring to a specific market. In other words, you should conduct a SWOT analysis. The SWOT method relies heavily on data, so use your analytics tools and data at full force. Look at factors like bounce rates, new visitors vs. returning visitors, acquisition, and site behavior to detect where there’s potential for improvement. It will help you look realistically at where you are now and where you want to be, helping you bridge the two. By turning weaknesses into strengths, seizing opportunities, and minimizing threats, you can create more valuable content and get it in front of your target audience. Analyzing your competitor’s’ content is essential. On the one hand, their social media profiles can provide useful information about your audience, helping you define which social channels are most popular and discover the most engaging content in your niche. On the other hand, they help you gain a valuable insight into your competitor’s content strategy. This includes things like how often and what type of content they post, and which social channels they prefer. The SEMrush Social Media Tracker helps you analyze your own content performance as well as your competitors’. It’s good practice to always compare yourself with your competitors to know where you stand. Data from SEMrush Social Media Tracker Step 2. Define your goals Your content marketing strategy should be centered around the specific results you want to accomplish. To get those results, you need to set and define very clear goals. Do you want to drive sales for specific products, increase brand awareness, and/or get more leads? Once you know what your goals are, you must define your KPI or key performance indicators. If you want to generate more leads, for example, you can measure how many new leads signed up for your newsletter each month. When defining your goals and KPI, always utilize the SMART method. The SMART method requires that your goals be Specific, Measurable, Agreed-Upon, Realistic, and Time-Based. Ultimately, your goals can’t account for much if they can’t be measured; saying “I want my readers to all really love this content” is not a specific goal because there is no end result and you can’t measure it. Instead, you could say “I want to increase brand awareness by increasing our social shares by 250% within the next six months.” This is a specific goal (brand awareness) with set measurable metrics (social shares), can be agreed-upon, is realistic (250% in six months could work), and time-based (six months). You can have multiple goals that you want to incorporate into your content marketing strategy, but you should have a clear plan for how you’ll accomplish each one. Step 3. Determine your target audience To reach your goals with content marketing you need to create content for each of your targeted audiences. No matter which business you are in, there will be different audiences you need to reach and each audience will be influenced differently. Creating customer personas is a great way to help break down the type of content each audience will need. Focus on demographics, needs, interests and locations. Always look to your sales team for ideas on customer personas. They answer the questions people have and they understand the needs of the customers. Use their thoughts for ideation. Also examine your competition’s social media interactions, content development, and community to determine if there is an audience you may have forgotten. Once you’ve decided who you want to reach, you will also want to take a close look at who you are connected with already. When you do, you can get an idea of who your content resonates with — and who you are missing. If you are missing a major segment of your ideal target audience, you can ask yourself why. You can use Google analytics for that.

Plan: Enterprise Benefits of LinkedIn Sales Navigator Biggest available B2B Network: With one of the largest professional networks on earth, over 740 million prospects, LinkedIn has a serious advantage – being the social network of choice for business professionals to do business. Because of this, LinkedIn Sales Navigator makes it possible to find almost anyone in B2B. Advanced Updates: LinkedIn Sales Navigator makes it not only easy to create prospect lists according to your Ideal Customer Persona, but receive updates on important LinkedIn activity. This could be anything like a change of jobs, a news mention of their company, and even more granular changes like when they LinkedIn post. This gives you a great reason to reach out and reconnect with prospects who have gone cold, or engage with new ones. Excellent Search Features, List Creation, Saved Searches, and View Similar These are some of the features that make the platform stand out. The sheer number of search filters makes it easy to find customers in your ICP with ease. Additionally, the ability to save searches, have LinkedIn update you when new prospects are found for that saved list, and the ability to view “similar” prospects to those that you have just found, give you endless possibilities to find those potential prospects. The Biggest Pitfalls of the Platform The Biggest Pitfalls of the LinkedIn Sales Navigator platform, is that the number of InMails is incredibly limited, ranging between 20-50 per month, when the average SDR needs to average 60 calls a day to make numbers. Additionally, with only an 18% response rate, there’s simply not enough value in sending InMails to new prospects which may or may not accept your InMail request – leaving you (and your sales results) hanging. LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Lusha Extension for LinkedIn In order to maximize the value of LinkedIn Sales navigator, and to use it effectively, we recommend pairing it with Lusha Extension for LinkedIn. Lusha Extension for LinkedIn is a Google Chrome Extension that allows you to solve the problem of “not enough LinkedIn Inmails” by allowing you to make a direct connection with your prospect.

Next, click the Lusha extension and, in one click, Lusha will show you all available contact data it has in its database, including direct dials and email addresses.

It’s fast, free to sign up for, with 5 free contact leads every single month.

Sales navigator professional vs. team vs. enterprise With LinkedIn Sales Navigator, there are three plans you can choose from, professional, team, and Enterprise. Sales Navigator Professional, Team, and Enterprise are all outlined above, including all of their features and an in-depth explanation of every feature, as of December 2021. At a glance, here are the key differences between the three plans: LinkedIn Sales Navigator Professional gives you all of the basic features, including the ability to perform advanced prospect searches based on advanced filters, create custom lists, and save searches. You also get 20 InMails a month. LinkedIn Sales Navigator Team plans provide you with all of the features found in Pro, plus the ability to share content and track its engagement, as well as create “warm introductions” from teammates, which gets you one step closer to Mrs. Hard to Reach Prospect. Combined with 30 InMails a month. LinkedIn Sales Navigator Enterprise provides you with all of the features found in Pro and Team plans, plus the added value of CRM updates, data validation, SSO, and advanced enterprise integrations. Add 50 InMails a month, with pricing that’s customized depending on the number of licenses and years you wish to purchase, and you’re sitting pretty with your prospecting. Does LinkedIn Sales Navigator include LinkedIn Premium? Yes, as of September 2021, LinkedIn made a decision to provide LinkedIn Sales Navigator users with Premium Career subscription at no additional cost. According to LinkedIn, LinkedIn Career allows you to get hired 2x as fast with its service, and claims that InMailing a recruiter using its Premium Career service is 2.6x as effective as email alone. It’s definitely a nice add on, and is great that it’s included in the price tag. Please note, that if you cancel your LinkedIn Sales Navigator subscription, you will also lose access to LinkedIn Premium Career. Bottom Line – is Sales Navigator worth it? Bottom Line: LinkedIn Sales Navigator is a powerful prospecting tool, which leverages LinkedIn’s network of almost 750 million business contacts. With advanced search filters, saved searches, the ability to create lists, save thousands of prospects at once, receive updates based on prospect and account activity of your choosing, this is a prospecting tool that’s an excellent resource. While it’s an excellent start to your prospecting, its main pitfalls lie in the fact that connection must be made through the LinkedIn platform, via InMail. With InMails in short supply, ranging between 20-50 per month per license, you’re going to need more than that to hit your numbers. Additionally, you’re restricted to the LinkedIn platform, which means a prospect can keep you at arm’s length, or just decide never to accept your InMail, leaving you out in the cold. When you combine LinkedIn Sales Navigator with Lusha Extension for LinkedIn, you allow yourself to leverage the strength of the LinkedIn network, and supplement your prospecting efforts with Lusha’s accurate B2B contact data. Whether you want to call your prospect by direct dial or you choose to email them, as long as the information is in the Lusha database, it’s easy to prospect your way. Lusha is also free to sign up for, with no credit card needed, and provides 5 free leads a month, making it an attractive option to prospect in tandem with LinkedIn Sales Navigator.",Linkedin Sales Navigator

In practice, LinkedIn Sales Navigator offers improved search capabilities, increased visibility into extended contact networks, and personalized algorithms that make it possible for sales and marketing teams to reach the right decision-maker at target companies. While the tool shares some features with Premium Business, Sales Navigator is purpose-built to help teams make the most of LinkedIn connections, find new contacts, and increase overall sales. Specific benefits of Sales Navigator include: Searches for your target audience using advanced filters Recommended sales leads and update tracking Advanced filtering not available in any other LinkedIn version Job change alerts Specific keyword mentions Unlimited profile searches Consider this last benefit — unlimited searches. While LinkedIn is a free social platform, the company does cap the number of profile searches you can do each month. Reach that limit and you’ll have to wait until searches roll over the next month. Sales Navigator removes this limitation and allows you to search as many profiles as necessary to achieve your sales goals. Tier Overview: What You Get With Each As noted above, Sales Navigator has three tiers: Professional, Team, and Enterprise. LinkedIn Sales Navigator cost increases by tier — Professional is $79.99 per month with an annual subscription, and Team is $108.33 per month. For Enterprise pricing, you’ll need to contact LinkedIn directly. Here’s a quick look at what you get with each tier. Professional Professional is the lowest-cost Sales Navigator option. It includes features such as advanced lead and company search, alerts on your sales leads and accounts, and the ability to create custom lists. Professional also integrates with popular sales tools such as SNAP, Outlook, and the Sales Navigator mobile app. Team Sales Navigator Team comes with all the features of Professional, along with the ability to share content and track engagement. You also get robust administrative tools and CRM platform syncing. Enterprise Enterprise takes your sales a step further with advanced CRM integrations. You get access to data validation and content creation tools, along with enterprise-level features such as single sign-on (SSO) for security and employee data integration for maximum sales impact.

LinkedIn offers a 1-month free trial for members that aren’t on paid subscription plans and haven’t used any free trials in the last 365 days. Thinking about making the switch but not sure how to use LinkedIn Sales Navigator? Read on for version-specific tips to help you make the most of this powerful sales framework. Tips for Sales Navigator Professional Sales Navigator Professional Cost $79.99/month with annual subscription or $99.99 per month Leads Save up to 1,500 and keep track of company updates for each one. Visibility Get a larger profile InMail Get 20 InMail messages each month for those hand-raisers who show interest in your products. Integrations Get the Outlook Web integration to quickly schedule meetings. 1. Message prospects without using your InMail quota. Professional, Team, and Enterprise Sales Navigator users can send up to 20, 30, and 50 InMail messages per month, respectively. If you want to send more than that, target users with “Open Profiles,” who won’t count toward your InMail quota. linkedin sales navigator professional: inmail Image Source As a bonus, “Open Profile” users are generally pretty receptive to being contacted. 2. Download the mobile app. Salespeople who spend lots of time away from their desk will appreciate the Sales Navigator app (available for iOS and Android.) The app delivers real-time updates about saved accounts and leads, so reps can quickly reach out after a prospect has written a new post, showed up in the press, or shared company news. Users can also see their daily account and lead recommendations and browse buyer profiles. The ability to save leads and accounts is also handy. With this feature, field sales reps can instantly save the connections they’ve made after a meeting or call rather than waiting till they’re in front of a computer. Lastly, the Sales Navigator app lets reps send InMail and messages on the go. Contacting a prospect quickly after a compelling event can mean the difference between winning and losing a deal, so this is a powerful feature. 3. Upgrade your profile. It’s easier to stand out with a Sales Navigator Team or Enterprise account, since these come with a larger profile picture and background photo. In addition, these users are displayed more prominently in search results. If a prospect searches for someone matching a rep’s description, that rep has a greater chance of catching her eye. 4. View similar prospects. Sales Navigator search functions include the ability to suggest similar leads to ones you’re currently pursuing. Simply click the drop-down button on a lead you’re looking at and then click “View similar” — this will bring up a list of leads with similar job titles or roles. This is a great way to focus your sales efforts on decision-makers and reduce the amount of time spent trying to find the right person in a company. 50+ for Social Selling on LinkedIn and Beyond Use this guide to improve your social selling efforts and close more deals from platforms like...

InMail Get 30 InMail messages each month for potential leads who show interest in your products. Integrations Get integrations with all the top CRM platforms, including HubSpot’s. 1. Integrate sales navigator with your HubSpot CRM. LinkedIn has partnered with several CRM providers — HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce, Zoho, and Infor — to bring profile details and shared connections from Sales Navigator experience into your CRM. That means as you’re doing your day-to-day in the CRM, you won't have to open a new tab (or three) to track down the lead or account in Sales Navigator. With a team account you can: Send InMail directly from a contact record View shared connections Ask mutual connections for introductions Add leads at the same company and add them to your Sales Navigator leads list Connect with people at an organization who have shared connections or interests Find out who you're already connected to in the organization Here’s a sample of what that integration might look like, in the context of HubSpot CRM: hubspot crm integration with linkedin sales navigator Already using one of the CRMs that integrates with Sales Navigator? Set up the sync now. Using another CRM, or not using one at all? Fear not: LinkedIn will be expanding the universe of CRM integrations so stay tuned. Note: To use HubSpot's integration with LinkedIn Sales Navigator, you must have a LinkedIn Sales Navigator Team or Enterprise account. 2. Apply the TeamLink filter. According to LinkedIn, you’re more likely to leave a favorable impression with buyers if you were introduced to them by a mutual connection. With the TeamLink Connections filter, you can easily find the prospects who meet your search criteria and share an acquaintance with you, whether it’s a first or second-degree connection. linkedin sales navigator team: teamlink filter Image Source This filter taps the networks of the other members of your sales team and your first-degree connections. Note: You must have a Team or Enterprise accounts to use TeamLink. 3. Save a TeamLink search. Just because you don’t have a mutual connection with a prospect now doesn’t mean you never will. Your contacts form new connections every week. But it’s inefficient to manually run the same searches again and again in the hopes something has changed. Fortunately, the “save search” feature lets you automate this step. Once you’ve defined your search parameters and applied the TeamLink filter, check the “Save Search” box. linkedin sales navigator team: teamlink search Image Source Now, if one of your coworkers connects with one of your leads, you’ll be instantly notified. Note: You must have a Team or Enterprise account to use TeamLink. 4. Check out the TeamLink section. You can also check out the TeamLink section of an accounts page, which helps you build strategic relationships at an organization you’re targeting. Let’s say you want to work with Blue Leaf. When you check out the TeamLink section of the Blue Leaf account page, TeamLink will display the current employees who are connected to members of your network. You can now ask those mutual connections for introductions. linkedin sales navigator team: teamlink section Note: You must have a Team or Enterprise accounts to use TeamLink. 5. Access the network of every person at your company. TeamLink lets you tap into the connections of every Sales Navigator seatholder at your company. But that mostly limits you to salespeople, recruiters, and maybe your executives — after all, the average marketer, customer support rep, or finance associate isn't going to need an account. With TeamLink Extend, these people can now opt-in to the Sales Navigator network. That means your pool of available contacts becomes much bigger. The first 1,000 seats of TeamLink Extend come bundled free with every Enterprise Edition contract. 6. Create custom lists of your prospects to keep track of their status. According to new research from Weidert Group, up to six different people are now involved in every B2B purchasing decision. To effectively work an account, you need to keep track of who’s involved in the buying process, form connections with them, and identify their unique objectives and priorities. It’s no small feat. Sales Navigator helps streamline this information by allowing you to create lists and filter leads based on the criteria you set. Once you’ve identified a relevant contact, you use keywords to show you only contacts who fit those criteria. You can then easily export this LinkedIn Sales Navigator list and import it to your CRM or outreach tool for further action. linkedin sales navigator team: custom lists Image Source 7. Use the “Interested In” filter to find ways of providing value. Finding ways to add value to your prospects’ lives isn’t always easy. Thanks to the “Interested In” filter, you can instantly figure out which buyers need your help — which will give you a major advantage when reaching out. For example, you can run a search for “mid-level marketing managers” and further narrow down the pool with the “Interested In: Industry experts” filter. Every prospect the search returns has self-indicated they’d like to meet industry experts. You can volunteer your own expertise, offer to connect them with a specialist inside your company, or introduce them to an external contact. 50+ for Social Selling on LinkedIn and Beyond Use this guide to improve your social selling efforts and close more deals from platforms like...

Thanks to Sales Navigator’s advanced filters, salespeople can hone in on specific prospect types. These include: Exclude saved, viewed, or contacted leads Company type: Public, private, or nonprofit (Also available in LinkedIn Premium) Groups (Also available in LinkedIn Premium) Years in current position Years at current company Years of experience (Also available in LinkedIn Premium) Member since (Also available in LinkedIn Premium) Headquarter Seniority level (Also available in LinkedIn Premium) Posted content keywords If you’re not quite sold on this feature yet, LinkedIn provides a full list of the advanced search filters. 9. Target high-value accounts. Sales and Marketing, good news: Working together on LinkedIn campaigns is easier than ever before, thanks to an integration between Sales Navigator and Campaign Manager. Like before, marketers are responsible for ad creative, budget, and timeline. Yet now, they can target the leads and accounts their sales reps are pursuing — meaning your messaging and value prop will be top-of-mind when you're engaging with potential customers. Marketing can even take advantage of lookalike modeling, so they can find and market to users similar to existing prospects and customers. Salespeople can see exactly how their prospects are engaging with marketing content and will even get alerts when a saved account has read, liked, or shared their company's sponsored content. 10. Leverage shared interests. One of the best ways to encourage more sales? Finding something in common to start the conversation. LinkedIn Sales Navigator streamlines this process with the “Share experiences with you” filter that shows you leads that have shared interests listed on their profile. These shared interests provide a great jumping-off point for conversations that go beyond basic cold calls and emails, in turn making it easier to jumpstart the sales process. Tips for Sales Navigator Enterprise Sales Navigator team Cost Contact LinkedIn for pricing Leads Save up to 10,000 leads and keep track of company updates for each one. Team Features Get enterprise-grade license management with single-sign-on for large sales teams. InMail Get 50 InMail messages each month for potential leads who show interest in your products. Advanced Features Get exclusive access to LinkedIn Elevate alerts and position yourself as a trusted point of contact for leads and clients. 1. Build rapport With “Shared Experiences and Commonalities”. Sales Navigator already allows users to save leads, but the “Share experiences with you” filter makes it easier to surface opportunities within that database. The filter gives you a strong foundation for building rapport by pulling together all the prospects who have at least one thing in common with you: Maybe you both lived in Manhattan at one point, worked for the same company, volunteered with the same nonprofit, or have another point of commonality. Mentioning this point of similarity when you reach out (either in your email subject line, the message body, or in your voicemail) will boost your chances of getting a response. 2. Unlock out-of-network user profiles. The unlock feature, which is available with Sales Navigator Team, lets reps view the full profile of a user outside of their network. Once they’ve unlocked a profile, everyone on their Sales Navigator team can see it. Every team member can unlock up to 25 profiles per month. To do so, click the blue “Unlock member profile” button in the top section of a member’s profile. 3. Refine your lead and account recommendations. Sales Navigator can help reps keep their pipeline full with automatic lead and account recommendations. To make sure their recommendations align as closely as possible with their buyer personas, salespeople should take advantage of the tool’s Sales Preferences. These criteria include region, industry, function, and seniority level. To add or modify these settings, click your profile picture in the top right corner and choose “Settings.” Then scroll down to the Sales Preferences section, type your choices, and click “Done.” refine lead account recommendations in linkedin sales navigator Sales Preferences only apply to lead and account recommendations, meaning regular searches include results that fall outside of a user’s saved choices. For instance, a rep might ask for recommendations for executive assistants in California, but simply searching “executive assistant” could generate prospects that live elsewhere. 4. Validate your CRM data. ""Clean data"" might not be the most glamorous two-word string in the English language, but it's critical to a high-functioning sales org. Without up-to-date, accurate information on leads, prospects, and customers, it's much harder for a rep to build rapport, earn credibility, add value, and eventually win the business. That's why LinkedIn's Data Validation feature is so great. It automatically updates contact data in your CRM in real time. Maybe you're in the early stages of your sales process when your main contact leaves the company. Because he updates his title, the record in your CRM changes too. 50+ for Social Selling on LinkedIn and Beyond Use this guide to improve your social selling efforts and close more deals from platforms like... LinkedIn TikTok Instagram And more! Learn more 5. Upload your book of business to Sales Navigator. If you’re just starting out with LinkedIn Sales Navigator, you may already have a list of contacts that you’re working with. Now, LinkedIn lets you upload that CSV list into Sales Navigator so you can seamlessly connect with your leads all in one place. If you’ve had trouble closing a deal or if there are more stakeholders in the approval process, you can uncover insights that will help you prioritize those contacts and plan your next steps to engage with them. You’ll also get alerts regarding updates at the company so you never miss a beat. 6. Generate interest with InMail. LinkedIn Sales Navigator gives you access to InMail – LinkedIn’s version of email or direct messages. InMail is only available to Sales Navigator subscribers, meaning your prospects likely see far fewer InMails than typical emails. The result? If you can stand out from the crowd by finding a shared interest or offering a unique viewpoint, InMail makes it possible to boost your connective impact. 7. Create a custom outreach message. Speaking of impact, one great way to do this in LinkedIn Sales Navigator is by creating a custom outreach message. First, run an advanced LinkedIn search to get details about your sales target’s industry, location, and market niche. Then, send something like this connection request template: “Hi, {first_name}, I’m reaching out to grow our network of {your_industry} leaders. Here in {your_city}, we’re exploring some great opportunities in {your_industry_niche}, and it would be great to connect with you and share what we’ve learned.” send-now-hubspot-sales-bar Adjust the details to match your needs, but make best use of the {} filters available in LinkedIn to create quick and easy templates you can quickly send to multiple leads. Worth noting? Connection — not conversion — is the goal of these initial InMails, so you’re best served by aiming for a natural, conversational tone over something more sales-focused. Prospect Better With LinkedIn Sales Navigator LinkedIn is a B2B sales and marketing powerhouse, and Sales Navigator gives your team critical insights to make the most of it. Whether you’re a team of one or part of an established enterprise, this tool has features to help you close deals with a human-centered perspective. There’s no more guessing or sending cold emails to the wrong decision-maker. LinkedIn Sales navigator unlocks the secrets to closing deals that the best prospectors and sales professionals swear by.

Sales Marketing,"What Is Sales Navigator? Sean Callahan Authored bySean Callahan Director-Content Marketing at Innovid January 23, 2023 What is Sales Navigator, what are it's key features and how can I get started. Sales Navigator is LinkedIn’s flagship product for sales teams, enabling reps, managers, and ops leaders to inform their approaches and strategies by taking advantage of the full breadth of LinkedIn’s expansive data, insight, and relationship-building tools. If you’re looking to gain a clear grasp of exactly what Sales Navigator offers, how it works, how to best maximize its value, and how it enables Buyer First Selling, you’ve come to the right place. What Is LinkedIn Sales Navigator? Sales Navigator is a deep sales platform that enables virtual selling by allowing sales professionals to build and maintain relationships with their buyers at scale. Sales Navigator is designed to be a centerpiece and fixture for modern B2B sales teams, integrating with other sales technologies (such as CRM) to provide a foundation of trusted, reliable, real-time data. Sales Navigator is the best version of LinkedIn for sales professionals. It features a powerful set of search capabilities, improved visibility into extended networks, and personalized algorithms to help you reach the right decision-maker at the right time. What Does Sales Navigator Do? At its core, Sales Navigator helps sales professionals successfully perform three of the most critical functions involved with their discipline. Target: Quickly identify and learn about people and companies that are a likely fit for your product or service. Understand: Track key developments at target accounts, such as decision-makers changing jobs or indicators of buying intent, to act on opportunities as they arise. Engage: Connect and converse with prospects within a ready-to-do-business environment while tapping into the full extent of LinkedIn’s messaging and content-sharing capabilities. In a new era of selling where putting the buyer first is paramount and virtual interactions are becoming the norm, Sales Navigator equips salespeople to lead with insight, deliver value that differentiates, and build relationships that fuel customer acquisition. That allows them to build deeper, more meaningful relationships. Key Features in Sales Navigator (and How to Use Them) How can Sales Navigator strengthen the efforts of you and your team on a day-to-day basis? These are some of the key features that users leverage most: Extended Network Access: Sales Navigator allows sellers to realize the full power of LinkedIn’s global network of professionals, with unlimited searches (which can be saved for ongoing efficiencies), and more. Advanced Searching Tools: Customize your settings and let Sales Navigator work for you. With Advanced search filters and Sales Preferences, you indicate what types of leads you want to see based on region, industry, function, and seniority level. Using these preferences, the platform will begin to surface account and lead recommendations automatically. Learn more about search here.

Outreach and Messaging: LinkedIn’s native messaging tool, InMail, is available to all users, but Sales Navigator provides more opportunities to use InMail to spark quick, personalized conversations with new prospects. Learn how to be great at InMailing here. Keep Track of People and Companies: Save your most promising accounts and leads to receive real-time updates and alerts. You can also build Custom Lists and record notes to share across the team. Learn more about LinkedIn Alerts here. screen shot of LinkedIn Sales Navigator homepage Relationship-building with Sales Navigator In the new era of selling, relationships are everything. Empowered buyers want to work with individuals they know and trust. Sellers who convey authentic intentions, deliver genuine value, and develop strong rapport are poised to take the lead. The problem, of course, is that building real relationships takes time and effort. Making it happen across a sizable pool of prospects is all but impossible without a technological assist. Sales Navigator enables sales professionals to build relationships at scale. When you save leads or contacts, the platform will automatically notify you of important moments and milestones, opportunities for timely outreach, and noteworthy developments at the account. Here are a few examples of ways you can take advantage of tools in Sales Navigator to facilitate efficient and effective relationship-building, all of which are highlighted in Relationship Explorer: A prospect starts a job at a new company. Maybe you hadn’t spoken with this saved lead in a while. The “Lead Career Change” alert informs you of the move, prompting you to send a message and check in on to see how the transition is going. Suddenly, you have a new potential prospect account on your radar. A prospect engages with content from your LinkedIn Page. You send over an InMail or Smart Links presentation with additional information and insight on the topic, concluding with an open-ended question to compel further conversation. A prospect shares a personal story via their LinkedIn profile. You’re notified of a “Lead Share” and the story strikes a chord. You send an InMail or leave a comment adding your own reaction or perspective. The prospect appreciates a genuine interaction, with no sales intent, and trust is strengthened. These examples merely scratch the surface of what sales professionals are able to do through Sales Navigator’s expansive set of features and capabilities. And because all of your outreach and interactions are being informed by trusted, high-quality, up-to-date data, you minimize the risk of getting details about them and their company wrong — cited in the State of Sales 2021 report as one of the top deal-breakers in the eyes of buyers.

The scenario: The solution: The second part of successfully implementing a successful Sales Navigator programme is to focus on performance. With LinkedIn’s performance metrics this is simple, the data is robust, accurate and in-depth.

Sales Marketing,"Six Sales Benefits of LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Their Use Cases Krista Kirrane	BY Krista Kirrane November 5, 2020 8 min read What is LinkedIn Sales Navigator? LinkedIn Sales Navigator is a sales management tool designed specifically for lead generation and sales prospecting on the LinkedIn platform. Sales Navigator is available in three different versions, each with varying features, but each version allows users to search for, connect with, and save leads within their LinkedIn account while also offering integration with different CRM programs. Why You Should Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator If you have a sales team, you probably already have multiple tools and technologies that your team uses every day. 74% of B2B sales teams say that LinkedIn products top their list of sales intelligence tools (LinkedIn). With 40% of LinkedIn’s 260 million active users accessing their LinkedIn accounts daily, it’s easy to see why (Kinsta). In today’s world of digital selling, emails and phone calls are no longer enough. Prospects are either too busy or not in their office to take sales calls, and emails are getting lost in a sea offers from competitors. With LinkedIn Sales Navigator, sales teams can put faces to their names, be more intentional with their messaging and be smarter about who they are reaching out to. Plus, as an added bonus, Sales Navigator can be an effective way to foster sales and marketing alignment in a single platform. Benefits of LinkedIn Sales Navigator Here are six features of LinkedIn Sales Navigator and how they can add value to your sales and marketing efforts: Saved Searches This is a must have for prospecting. With Saved Searches, you can create dynamic lead lists based on geography, relationship, company size, title, number of years in current position, and more. Sales Navigator Lists You can then filter results by: Changed jobs in past 90 days Leads with TeamLink intro Posted on LinkedIn in past 30 days Share experiences with you Leads that follow your company on LinkedIn The best part is that you don’t have to be plugged into Sales Navigator all day to keep up with updates to your list. You will receive email notifications about new leads and lead activity. Use Cases Targeting lists for account-based marketing efforts can come in handy here. Find the key people for your targeted list at companies that match your marketing size and criteria. If cold outreach is part of your sales process, this tool is invaluable. You probably already have a customer profile that will inform your search criteria. Once you have your search results, you can prioritize who to reach out to and personalize your messaging by looking at leads that you share a connection with, leads that have recently posted something on LinkedIn or leads that already follow your company. What about sales and marketing alignment? Perhaps your company is focused on regional sales and wants to build brand awareness. A great practice to adopt would be to look at leads in your area that have changed jobs in the past 90 days and send them a card or gift to congratulate them on their new position. InMail Sales Navigator InMail allows you to contact anyone on LinkedIn without a connection or their contact information (Note: If you don’t see the option to InMail a user, it’s because they have opted out). It is straight forward, but a couple of benefits are being able to save a lead directly from your inbox and being able to see whether your message was accepted or declined. You can also look at the percentage of InMails sent that were accepted by the recipient within 30 days. Think of it as an email campaign for people who haven’t opted into your email communications. Use Cases Perhaps you email a prospect and it bounces. The next logical step would be to InMail them with the hope that they check their LinkedIn account. If they don’t accept your message within 30 days, you will know that it is probably time to move on. If you have already reached out to a prospect a few times using traditional channels, it might be a good idea to try InMail. You most likely won’t be competing with as many messages in their LinkedIn Inbox, and once again, you can see whether they accept your message or not. Don’t have an email address on hand? Rather than harvesting or list purchasing (which we strongly recommend against), try reaching out via InMail instead—and remember to add value to the conversation with informational content rather than simply leaning straight into a meeting request. Smart Links This may be one of the best features of Sales Navigator. A Smart Link is a link to a document (PDF, Word, PowerPoint or image file) or a downloadable (a video, zip file, CSV, etc.) that you can insert in an InMail message. You may be asking yourself, “Why not just send files via email?”. With Smart Links Insights, you can track the following metrics: Confirmation that the recipient clicked the link, and the number of times they clicked it Amount of time the recipient spent viewing the content The date and time that the recipient accessed the content If the recipient was signed in when they viewed the content, information from their profile—name, title, company and profile picture If the recipient was not signed in when they viewed the content, the name they provided to access it and their email if they chose to provide it Use Cases If sending relevant content to prospects is already part of your sales process, sending it via Smart Links in InMail is a great way to step your game up. Using the metrics provided by Smart Links Insights, you can see how serious a prospect is about your product based on whether they viewed the content and how much time they spent viewing it. You can also use these metrics to inform when and if you follow up with them again. Not to mention, if you know they viewed your content, you can reference it in your next follow up. This is an awesome way to build some data for the sales and marketing teams as to what kind of proposals and sales materials truly resonate with your prospect base—and using the data, you can improve the items you create for future campaigns as well. Lists Lists are like Saved Searches in terms of filters, but they are static lists that you can add leads and accounts to. If you are a Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics user, you can also use Sales Navigator’s CRM Sync to import your existing accounts and leads and track Sales Navigator activity in your CRM. The nice thing about lists is that you can collaborate with other team members by sharing notes and you can see your outreach activity. Use Cases If you want to keep track of clients that are leaving their current company, this is a great way to do that. Simply create a list for previous customers and add contacts as soon as you are notified that they will be leaving. You will then be able to keep track of them and see when they start at a new company, giving you an opportunity to proactively reach out and celebrate them. If reaching out to prospects via Sales Navigator becomes a regular part of your process, you can use lists to track your activity. Within the list, you can see your Outreach Activity next to each lead and track the following: Connection requests you’ve sent and how many have been accepted InMail messages you’ve sent and responses Messages you’ve sent from Sales Navigator and LinkedIn responses Whether a Smart Link was clicked Alerts As I mentioned earlier, you don’t need to be plugged into Sales Navigator 24/7 to keep up with your saved search results or your lead lists. Sales Navigator will email you alerts, and you can choose which ones you want to receive. sales navigator preferences Use Cases If you like to be intentional with your messaging, some updates to look out for are when a lead shares an update, a saved lead starts a position at a new company, or a saved account is mentioned in the news. These are great excuses to reach out and they provide you with ways to personalize your message. CRM Embedded Profile If you are a Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics user, you can use the Sales Navigator CRM Embedded Profile to view and leverage LinkedIn information directly from your CRM. This is what it looks like in Microsoft Dynamics: Sales Navigator microsoft dynamics On the “Icebreakers” tab, you can see the lead’s profile information, shared connections and experiences, and their recent LinkedIn activity. sales navigator icebreaker The “Get Introduced” tab shows shared connections and provides a link to ask for an introduction. sales navigator related leads The “Related Leads” tab shows leads from the same company, as well as leads with similar job titles from other companies. Use Cases If you rely heavily on your CRM, this simply makes your life easier by having all relevant LinkedIn information in one place. If you are getting ready to reach out to a lead, you likely already have their record open to update it. With one click, you can view the “Icebreakers” tab which will give you something to reference such as where they attended college, a shared connection or a blog post they recently shared. You can find new prospects within your CRM. Create a list view of leads that previously converted and click into each one to view similar leads under the “Related Leads” tab. You can even save them to one of your Sales Navigator lists directly from the CRM. When used wisely, LinkedIn Sales Navigator can make prospecting and outreach easier and more efficient. While email and phone calls likely aren’t going anywhere, Sales Navigator is there to provide another sales channel, add additional touchpoints, and keep sales teams organized and up to date on their leads and accounts.

Sales Marketing,"How to Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to Improve Customer Acquisition by Anna Sonnenberg / July 11, 2023 Wondering how to identify and reach the right prospects and decision-makers on LinkedIn? Want to bridge marketing and sales activities to nurture and convert more leads on LinkedIn? In this article, you’ll discover a framework for using LinkedIn Sales Navigator to improve customer acquisition. How to Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to Improve Customer Acquisition by Social Media Examiner Why Marketers Should Master LinkedIn Sales Navigator For B2B social media marketers, LinkedIn customer acquisition is crucial for connecting with new customers and building an engaged community. It's also a valuable space for social selling and adding qualified prospects to your marketing funnel. Yet as useful as the free version of LinkedIn can be, it isn't the most efficient option for acquiring customers. Instead, LinkedIn's premium product, Sales Navigator, is a much more effective platform for finding potential clients. If you're new to Sales Navigator, think of it as a superpowered version of LinkedIn. It has tools for buyer personas, customer research, social listening, and even outreach—essentially, everything you need for prospecting. Since Sales Navigator also has collaboration features, it allows your marketing team to work with the sales team on prospecting and lead generation. The platform lets you share account maps with team members so everyone can tap into the same insights and work toward the same goals. 10 Ways to Leverage LinkedIn Sales Navigator for B2B Prospecting Ready to streamline your prospecting playbook with Sales Navigator? Use the framework below to find potential customers and create valuable connections. #1: Build Buyer Personas Efficient B2B prospecting starts with knowing your ideal customer profile (ICP). When you know exactly who you should target, you can filter out the businesses and people who aren't a good fit for your product or service and focus your efforts on those who are. Launched in early 2023, Sales Navigator's Persona tool lets you enter up to five different ICPs. Then you can use these personas as preset filters to find potential customers in seconds. Your personas apply throughout Sales Navigator, giving you plenty of opportunities to zero in on your ideal customers. linkedin-sales-navigator-tool-building-ideal-personas-1 To set one up, open the Persona tool in the right-hand sidebar of your Sales Navigator dashboard. Click to create a new persona and open each field to select relevant options. For example, you can define your buyer persona using functions, seniority levels, and locations. You can even enter unique job titles to make the persona more specific. Once you explore the personas you've built, you can revisit them at any time to make them more or less specific. For example, you may want to expand your search with more job titles or narrow it by targeting markets in certain zip codes rather than in larger regions. #2: Find Decision-Makers If you already have saved accounts (i.e., companies) in Sales Navigator, you can find decision-makers who fit your ICP in one click. From the persona panel, click the [Number of] Persona Leads link to start browsing relevant decision-makers. linkedin-sales-navigator-decision-makers-2 The Sales Navigator search panel will open and apply your persona filters automatically. But you don't have to search for B2B purchasers using that set of filters alone. You can also use Sales Navigator's dozens of filter options to narrow your search. For example, you can filter by: Current and past companies Company headcount Years at current company or in current position Years of experience Professional industry linkedin-sales-navigator-lead-personas-filter-3 You can view prospects' LinkedIn profiles directly in Sales Navigator to vet them further. From the search dashboard, you can also opt to save users to your list of contacts so you can keep an eye on their LinkedIn activity and add them to your outreach list. #3: Scale Customer Research Sales Navigator helps marketers take deep dives into individual accounts and lead profiles. But this platform is just as useful for scaling the customer acquisition process and building a list of potential contacts To expand your list of leads and accounts, open the filter dashboard and apply relevant filters (i.e., a persona) without adding the All My Saved Accounts filter. That way, you can broaden your search and discover potential contacts for your sales rep. You can also click over to the Accounts tab to filter by businesses rather than decision-makers. linkedin-sales-navigator-account-personas-filter-4 Although persona filters can help you target your ICP efficiently, they probably won't be the only filters you use in Sales Navigator. Once you find the ideal combination of lead or account filters, save your search. Not only will you be able to revisit your search with a single click but you'll also get alerts about relevant leads and accounts, which can enhance your prospecting efforts. Want to prioritize multi-threading to increase your chance of making an impact on the buying team? Click on any account that fits your ICP to take a closer look at its decision-makers. From here, you can connect with multiple users at key accounts. linkedin-sales-navigator-persona-common-search-alerts-5 For example, you can easily find all the decision-makers at any account you select. You can also apply persona filters to connect with users who are likely to fit your ICP. #4: Identify Buyer Intent A quick look at a company page or a member profile can't always tell you whether leads or accounts have purchase intent. In many cases, you'd need to spend hours reading through posts and cross-checking against other mechanisms to determine where buyers are in the sales cycle. Sales Navigator uses first-party signals to gauge buyer intent automatically. From the buyer intent dashboard, you can see whether your saved accounts are showing intent signals so you can loop in your sales team. You can also find these analytics on account pages, even if you aren't actively following them yet. To streamline your prospecting, you can also apply buyer intent signals during account searches. To connect with decision-makers who are looking for the products and services your business offers, you can use Sales Navigator's product category intent filter and build a list of marketing qualified leads (MQLs). Note that you need an Advanced or Advanced Plus subscription to Sales Navigator to access buyer intent features. These subscription levels also let you sync your team's customer relationship management (CRM) tool for added insights and data sharing. #5: Set Up Social Listening Just because buyers aren't actively talking about purchasing products in your category doesn't mean you should write them off. Instead, use social listening to keep an eye on the types of conversations they're having and the pain points they're experiencing. The Sales Navigator home page automatically displays alerts based on the activity of contacts, accounts, and searches you've saved. In the alert feed, you can filter by certain contacts or accounts to ensure you don't miss important updates. You can also filter by alert types like engagement, shares, or news, which can help you find relevant activity more efficiently. linkedin-sales-navigator-pain-point-alerts-6 When you find alerts that look relevant to your business, bookmark them for review. Then review this saved prospect activity and look for possible points of connection. For example, you might find that potential contacts are posting about leaving your competitor or considering a career move. In some cases, you might use these posts for research purposes alone. But when it makes sense to join the conversation, you can engage with prospects' LinkedIn content directly from Sales Navigator. Click to open the post and comment or react from the dashboard. #6: Spot Sales Triggers Although you'll need to review prospect content manually to find mentions of upcoming career changes, Sales Navigator automatically alerts you to sales trigger events like these once they happen. You'll see all of these alerts on the platform's main dashboard and you can filter to find them more easily. Want to check if any of your saved contacts have made a career move recently? Filter your alerts by leads and view career changes only. You can click to view the lead's new company and save it to your account list if it's relevant or remove the lead from your list completely if not. You can also monitor career changes at the account level. Filter by new decision-makers to review new potential contacts. You can click to save these leads to your list or connect with them directly via Sales Navigator. linkedin-sales-navigator-monitor-sales-triggers-8 If you have an Advanced Plus Sales Navigator account with synced CRM data, you can also use the account risk filter to identify businesses that contacts have recently left. Then you can decide whether to prioritize seeking out a new contact or removing the account from your list altogether. If you have the core version of Sales Navigator like I do, you won't be able to view buyer intent, but you can use automated growth alerts to get more analytics on your contacts. Available on the accounts dashboard, these growth alerts can help you understand what's happening behind the scenes so you can get a better sense of their purchase intent. inkedin-sales-navigator-automated-growth-alerts-9 #7: Guide Content Creation By monitoring prospect activity and sales trigger events, your team can keep lead lists updated and respond to relevant content in a timely manner. But you can also take your efforts a step further by using the metrics you've gathered to inform the content you publish. This strategy can work for both your LinkedIn company page and your teams' member profiles. For example, you might find that your saved contacts are sharing a lot of content about a problem that your product is designed to solve. You might consider creating content that highlights the ways your product addresses those pain points. Or you might find that the accounts you follow are sharing a lot of content related to an industry trend. If the content is successfully generating engagement, you might consider creating content that features your organization's own take on the trend. By creating content that's likely to appeal to your target leads and accounts, you can prioritize social selling. In other words, you can focus more on providing value and cultivating relationships while spending less time on more direct sales. #8: Start Personalized Conversations When you use Sales Navigator data to guide your company page or personal profile content, it will likely resonate with a lot of people, especially those who fit your ICP. But you can also use the platform to help you start more personal conversations with contacts. When you explore a lead's profile, the dashboard automatically analyzes your relationship, even if you aren't first-degree connections. For example, I can see that Mike Stelzner and I have several mutual connections and a group in common. All of these metric points can inform my outreach and help me write more relevant InMail. linkedin-sales-navigator-mutual-connections-with-prospects-10 If you're looking to make connections beyond your current list of leads, use Sales Navigator's Relationship Explorer tool. Available at the account level, it automatically highlights things you have in common with decision-makers at the companies you care about. linkedin-sales-navigator-relationship-explorer-tool-11 For example, you can see contacts you share connections and experiences with. You can also see contacts who have recently changed jobs or are actively posting on LinkedIn. With a quick profile check, you can learn more about their new role or their recent topics. Then you can use this information to start a conversation or generate leads. With InMail, you can reach out to leads directly, even if you aren't connected on LinkedIn. But sending InMails doesn't guarantee a response and it isn't the only way to start a conversation with a prospect. You can also focus your outreach efforts on commenting, especially if your leads are active content creators. #9: Collaborate With Sales Sales Navigator has plenty of tools for solo marketers but it also works well for teams. One way to collaborate with sales reps or other marketers is by sharing account maps. To get started, open an account and scroll down to the account map. Modify it as necessary to reflect the top opportunities for your business. Then click to open the menu and share it with the team member of your choice. linkedin-sales-navigator-sharing-account-maps-12 Another option is using Sales Navigator's TeamLink tool, which can help you connect with prospects faster. When you enable the TeamLink filter for leads, it reveals your team members' LinkedIn connections so you can see who can connect you with a lead. linkedin-sales-navigator-teamlink-tool-13 With an Advanced or Advanced Plus subscription plan, you can also sync CRM data to Sales Navigator. That way, you can share prospecting, lead generation, and sales data seamlessly. #10: Inform Paid Campaigns All of the tactics above apply to organic outreach and LinkedIn content. Although Sales Navigator doesn't connect directly to LinkedIn Campaign Manager, you can use what you've gleaned from the sales platform to inform your paid campaigns on LinkedIn. One option is using attribute-based targeting to reach LinkedIn users based on the company they work for or the job titles they have. Use your saved leads and accounts to guide the list of attributes you target. Note that you'll need to build this list manually since it isn't possible to import this information into Campaign Manager. linkedin-sales-navigator-attribute-based-targeting-14 Another option is creating a Matched Audience using prospect data. For example, you can create a list of companies you want to target and upload it as a Matched Audience. Then you can retarget members in the Matched Audience based on their activity. For best results, use intent-based activity to generate leads. linkedin-sales-navigator-prospect-data-matched-audience-targeting-15 Conclusion LinkedIn offers a strong starting point for B2B prospecting but using Sales Navigator gives your team access to much more powerful tools. With the framework above, marketing and sales teams can work together to connect with more prospects and add more MQLs to the sales funnel.

Here’s why. The most significant amount of B2B leads LinkedIn generates the largest number of B2B leads on social platforms – 80% compared to roughly 13% of leads driven by Twitter and 7% by Facebook. Using LinkedIn Sales Navigator, you’ve got the richest source of B2B data: over 75 million organizations have LinkedIn accounts. Extensive pool of methods to work with B2B leads Depending on the Sales Navigator subscription plan, social marketers have access to different features and tools to get qualitative leads and convert them into clients: Advanced Search InMail Custom Lists Alerts Smart Links Team collaboration tools CRM integrations and more Better sales content exposure One of the Sales Navigator’s features, Smart Links, allows packaging and sharing of sales content: product overview, sales presentation, demo video, PDF case study, pitch deck, brochure, etc. Additionally, it enables tracking your prospects’ behavior with your content. Smart Links has great selling potential and can help expose your company’s content more efficiently and increase LinkedIn conversion rates. Shortened sales cycles Based on LinkedIn’s report, Hyland Software, for instance, reduced sales cycles by 30% to 60% with the help of Sales Navigator.

Increased revenue In 2017, LinkedIn analyzed companies from 14 different industries. All of them had been using Sales Navigator for over a year. During that time, each organization’s revenue was significantly impacted by Sales Navigator. The percentage of income prompted by social selling ranged from 51% in telecommunications to 67% in computer and network security. Image Source 5 LinkedIn Sales Navigator Tips for Generating B2B Leads Now, let’s look at the top five tactics you can use to leverage LinkedIn Sales Navigator, unlock more possibilities in B2B prospecting, and target the right buyers. Target your B2B audience better with Advanced Search filters and Booleans An Advanced Search option in LinkedIn Sales Navigator offers over 30 search filters for sales prospecting. It allows you to find accounts and leads, segmenting them by location, industry, job title, profile language, company headcount, etc. Image Source “An often underestimated practice in LinkedIn Sales Navigator is the Boolean search,” says Tory Gray, CEO & Founder of Gray Dot Company. “Booleans like OR, AND, NOT, parentheses (), and quoted search “ ” can help you prospect more efficiently and close B2B deals faster. You can use them in the keyword search bar for accounts and leads in the title field. After using Booleans, you should refine your search results with Advanced Search. Together, they give you a more polished list of leads,” Tory mentions. Image Source Save searches and segment leads into custom lists After filtering your search results, you can make a saved search. Alternatively, you can save particular leads, click “Select all,” and then save them to one list. Make a new lead list if you haven’t done it before. Images Source Chris Cozzolino, Co-Founder and CEO of Uptown Creation, explains how to keep LinkedIn Sales Navigator leads organized in this video. He recommends creating four Lead lists: Connection Request Sent Message 1 Sent Responded Follow-Up Of course, you can name and organize your lead lists however it feels most convenient. Benefit from InMail messaging InMail is a feature that lets you contact any B2B prospect or lead with a direct message without sending a connection request first. Image Source In LinkedIn Sales Navigator, you get 50 free InMail message credits every month, irrespective of the Sales Navigator edition. You can also purchase some additional InMail credits if needed. Note: the open rate for InMails is 166% higher than regular emails. Besides, personalized InMails can bring you a 15% greater result than those sent in copy-pasted heaps. Follow some pieces of advice on InMail personalization and other actionable tips on using InMail shared by Logan Mallory, VP of Motivosity: “Targeting your B2B prospects with InMail, you should personalize your messages as much as possible so that each recipient can feel a personal touch throughout the text. You should start with personalized subject lines, of course. But don’t forget to optimize them with attention-grabbers to achieve higher open rates. You’ve got 80 characters to do magic with your subject line, so don’t squander them.” Check some examples of creative subject lines for InMail sends below. Image Source Logan Mallory also believes it’s beneficial to use the Rule of Three regarding the InMail body. When three items are grouped, named, or listed together, they are more memorable, impactful, and motivational. For example: reduce, reuse, recycle. You can stick to a three-part structure in your message and group your ideas into three big categories. Monitor your overall progress with Social Selling Index (SSI) Social selling leaders typically generate 45% more sales opportunities than those who have a low SSI. SSI is a performance indicator and helpful metric to measure your efforts on LinkedIn by focusing on the four components: Professional branding Engaging with insights Networking with the targeted audience Building profound relationships Each component is worth 25 points. Your total score may range from zero to 100. Image Source Calculating your SSI score, LinkedIn relies on the following data in Sales Navigator: a) saved leads and accounts; b) profile views; c) people searches; and d) Account and Lead Lists. Align marketing and sales When sales and marketing on LinkedIn are properly coordinated, the customer retention rate grows by 36% and the revenue – by 208%. Besides, LinkedIn members are 25% more likely to reply to a Sales Navigator InMail message from a sales representative when they see marketing content from that brand. “Building brand awareness and improving engagement of your B2B audience on LinkedIn is as simple as posting short videos,” according to Max Wühr, co-founder & CGO at FINN. “Video marketing on LinkedIn helps you communicate your brand’s message in the most effective visual way because videos perform better than images and texts. You can make your mark with B2B videos on LinkedIn and keep your prospects updated on what’s happening in your company,” he notes. Regularly, FINN shares video updates about their business on LinkedIn. Their most recent announcement, for instance, was a video of the first car delivery for a B2B customer in the United States.

Sales Marketing,"Social selling has transformed the sales landscape, making it easier than ever before to connect with prospects and discover leads organically. LinkedIn, the standard social platform for professional networks and relationships, has long been a popular and effective place to find and nurture sales leads. Now, LinkedIn Sales Navigator offers sales organizations even more power to discover leads and manage their pipelines effectively. Here’s everything you need to know about LinkedIn Sales Navigator to determine whether it’s right for you. What is LinkedIn Sales Navigator? LinkedIn has both free and paid versions. There are paid licenses for recruiters, job seekers, professionals, and now sales reps. LinkedIn Sales Navigator is LinkedIn’s paid sales solution. It is a sales management tool designed to help sales reps tap into LinkedIn’s extensive network more effectively and, ultimately, land more (and better) deals. Here’s how... Top features Sales Navigator has some impressive premium features. These are a few of the most impactful on each plan: Core With the Core subscription, members can access: 50 InMail messages per month 10,000 saved leads Advanced lead and company search Custom lists Lead and account alerts Notes and tags InMail is a key feature for salespeople who are on the hunt for leads. The free version of LinkedIn doesn’t allow users to directly message people outside of their network. With Sales Navigator, reps can now reach out to fresh leads that they may not be directly connected with yet, a feature that gives salespeople more opportunities to discover and build relationships with leads outside their direct network. Additionally, the ability to use advanced searches, save leads, create custom account lists, and add notes or tags to leads and accounts makes it easier for sales reps to manage their pipeline and ensure nothing falls through the cracks. Advanced The Advanced plan includes everything under the Core plan plus a few more key features: TeamLink and TeamLink Extend Team collaboration tools Embedded profile integrations Smart Links The Advanced plan gives users access to TeamLink and TeamLink Extend, integration with their workflows, collaboration functionality such as sharing lists and searches, and Smart Links for tracking content engagement. TeamLink enables reps to view and search their team’s connections to identify who has first-degree connections with a prospect in the pipeline. Reps can then reach out to their team members for a warm introduction to the lead, giving them a more likely path to sale. Advanced Plus The Advanced Plus plan has all the best features from the Core and Advanced plans as well as: CRM integrations Data validation ROI reporting Advanced Plus plans are designed for teams of 10 or more. Users can integrate with their CRM and measure their impact on revenue. Benefits of LinkedIn Sales Navigator The extensive premium features and sales resources available on Sales Navigator bring several significant benefits. As you learn how to use Sales Navigator more effectively, you’ll enjoy even more benefits, including greater efficiency and improved sales results across the board. Here are just a few benefits of using Sales Navigator. CRM integrations Sales Navigator integrates with several popular sales apps and customer relationship management programs, including: Salesforce HubSpot G2 Outreach Simply import your Sales Navigator data into your preferred CRM and get to work! This makes it even easier to manage your pipeline and track your sales data from one location. Targeted searches The Sales Navigator advanced search function gives reps the power to more narrowly target their ideal leads and discover relevant connections. Sales reps can choose from a large number of filters for people and/or companies including: Keywords Geographic location (by region or state) Job title Company name Company size Company type (e.g., public, private, non-profit) Group membership School Years of experience Industry Job opportunities Number of followers These premium search filters save reps time by helping them target the most relevant connections so they can focus on more valuable sales tasks, like building relationships and closing deals. Automated lead generation The Lead Recommendations feature suggests relevant leads based on your sales preferences, search history, profile views, and past saved leads. This is a great feature because it saves reps a step in the sales process, helping them fill their pipeline faster with relevant connections. Powerful sales insights The beauty of Sales Navigator is that the more you use it, the more data it can use to deliver valuable insights. As you search for prospects, save leads, and make connections, Sales Navigator will keep you posted on updates in your network such as: Job changes Company updates Relevant connections and warm leads Access to out-of-network connections One of the biggest benefits of LinkedIn Sales Navigator (Advanced plan) is the opportunity to extend your sales reach outside your direct network. Normally, you can only view the limited profiles of people outside your network. Sales Navigator lets members “unlock” that information so you can better understand your leads and make more meaningful connections. LinkedIn Sales Navigator cost As mentioned previously, LinkedIn Sales Navigator offers three pricing tiers: Core, Advanced, and Advanced Plus. The size of your team or organization and your goals will help determine which plan (and corresponding features) is right for you. Each tier has a Monthly or Annual price plan—both with a free trial or demo.* The month-to-month plan is slightly more expensive than the annual commitment. While you can cancel anytime, your annual plan remains effective until the end of the year for which you paid. So if you want to try Sales Navigator for a shorter term (i.e., less than a year), the month-to-month plans may be a better fit. You can always upgrade to an annual plan later. *Note: Free trials are only available to members who are not currently on a LinkedIn paid subscription plan and haven’t done a free trial on LinkedIn within the last year. Free trials are also not available for Advanced Plus plans. Let’s break it down: Per license, a Core plan costs $99.99/month per license or $959.88 billed annually as one payment. Per license, the Advanced plan costs $159.99/month or $1,500 billed annually as one payment. For teams of 10 or more sales professionals, LinkedIn recommends the Advanced Plus plan, which requires a custom quote. Is LinkedIn Sales Navigator worth it? In a word: yes. While sales organizations with little experience selling on LinkedIn should test the waters on the free version first, Sales Navigator is a natural next step for teams who are ready to take their pipelines to the next level.",Linkedin Sales Navigator
Sales Marketing,"[Features, Benefits and Hacks] Sixteen years since its official launch, LinkedIn has become a staple in the grown-up world of professional networking and lead generation. It has continued to roll out new features that are increasingly becoming more useful in the B2B social segment, with everyone from self entrepreneurs, to small enterprises and large organizations turning to the platform every single day. One of the best lead generation tools many businesses are taking advantage of is LinkedIn Sales Navigator. What Is LinkedIn Sales Navigator? Sales Navigator is a premium feature on LinkedIn that helps businesses generate leads on LinkedIn by allowing you to easily find your target audience and connect with them in just a few clicks. It is described as the best version of LinkedIn for anyone interested in sales prospecting, thanks to its many features specially designed with this in mind. Available in three variants (Professional, Team, and Enterprise) Sales Navigator doesn’t come for cheap, particularly in the case of many small business owners. However, LinkedIn does offer a 30-day free trial to allow you to evaluate whether the tool is worth investing in. Or not. Explore the best sales automation tools for small business, along with the other useful sales automation tools and it’s impact to productivity in generating leads and other valuable insights. LinkedIn Sales Navigator Features As briefly mentioned, LinkedIn Sales Navigator has a slew of features many businesses and sales reps will find useful. These include: 1. Lead Builder Lead Builder is a neat feature in LinkedIn that makes it easy to reach out to your target audience by narrowing down users in Search using important filters like the following: Keywords Geography Industry Company Seniority level Title Function Relationship Company size While a free LinkedIn account comes with its share of filters, the Advanced Lead Search in Sales Navigator is like putting your search on a turbo. It lets you segment leads using more definite search criteria not available on free LinkedIn accounts, increasing your chances of finding more targeted leads and picking up valuable specifics about them that you can leverage. This feature can also provide details such as: Users who have recently switched jobs Users who have created a post on LinkedIn shared their experience or featured in the news All these reasons combined make this one of the most useful features of this LinkedIn marketing software.

Save as Lead After creating a targeted search to identify your ideal prospects, going through the drill again is not only a pain but also a drain on your valuable time. But Save as Lead absolves you of the need to do it all over again by giving you the option to save your search as Leads for your business in a separate section of your dashboard. This means you’ll conveniently have all your leads in one easily accessible location, and it comes with the bonus of getting regular updates about these users. As a result, you now have the chance to focus on your leads and warm them up by commenting or liking their updates before ultimately converting them into customers. 3. InMails InMails are something you are most likely familiar with. These are private messages you can send directly to any user on the platform, including users you are not connected to. InMails are only available to premium account and Sales Navigator holders, and there is a limited number you can send each month based on your account type. Sales Navigator account is eligible for 20 monthly InMails, 30 for Sales Navigator Team, and 50 for the Enterprise account. If used correctly, InMails are one of the most effective LinkedIn prospecting tools you can use to engage leads and other parties of interest – influencers, for example. Create a catchy subject line for LinkedIn message to increase your LinkedIn InMale response rate. 4. CRM Integration Another useful feature of Sales Navigator, CRM Integration makes it possible to integrate your LinkedIn account with two popular CRM platforms, Microsoft Dynamics and Salesforce. This means you can now accomplish your tasks without toggling back and forth between your CRM system and Sales Navigator. 5. Sales Navigator Team As the name might suggest, this feature should be useful for any company with a sales or marketing team on LinkedIn. It enables sales and/or marketing teams to collaborate more efficiently in reaching their goals, giving each member of the team an ability to: Save up to 5,000 prospects Send 30 InMails per month Access TeamLink, another LinkedIn feature that makes it possible to reach a large audience by making use of connections belonging to the team Integrate with their own Salesforce/Dynamic account Access regular reports to monitor sales performance Automate LinkedIn Prospecting with Octopus CRM LinkedIn Premium & Sales Navigator Benefits No Commercial use Limits One of the drawbacks of using the free version of LinkedIn is the commercial use limit placed on this type of account. For any business that is serious about generating leads on LinkedIn, the only way to go is to upgrade to the premium version or subscribe to Sales Navigator. Obviously, the last thing you want when conducting lead generation searches is to lose access to your painstakingly done search results midway through the month. Another functionality you risk losing through a free account is the ability to browse profiles using the People Also Viewed provision. Read also: LinkedIn Sales Navigator vs LinkedIn Premium Ability to Send Unlimited Number of Connection Requests The saying “the best things in life are free” is definitely not one that applies to LinkedIn accounts! LinkedIn users are normally allowed a certain number of connection requests per day. A maximum of 100 invitations is a safe bet to stay on the right side of the law, and you will be prompted to enter a Captcha if you exceed this number. Now, if you are on a free account, the risks of your account being flagged or banned are marginally higher compared to paid users on LinkedIn Premium and Sales Navigator since you’ll likely be considered a spammer. LinkedIn is managed by algorithms that monitor whether or not you are abiding by the rules which tend to favor targeted connections over random and mass linking, so you can only go under the radar for so long. Unlimited Search Results LinkedIn is pretty clear on its intentions. It wants recruiters to pay for its services and clearly notes that commercial use limit signals that your intention on LinkedIn is likely to do with commercial purposes such as prospecting and hiring. This is why they have placed a limit on the number of searches you can conduct using a Basic account, although they have never specified what exactly constitutes a “limit”. But the LinkedIn marketing software that is Sales Navigator (as does LinkedIn Premium) enables you to blast through these search limits.

If you have a paid account, you’re more likely to have your account restored or wait for a lesser duration for the issue to be resolved if you do something that violates LinkedIn’s terms of service. For example, reviewing too many profiles or sending too many connection requests could lead to account flagging or termination.

But it does come at a cost, and whether or not this cost is worth it will vary from one company to the next. If your business is already leveraging LinkedIn for sales, it definitely makes sense to try Sales Navigator. It is a great avenue to supplement your existing CRM and take advantage of a social platform boasting over 500 million users. However, if you are just starting to use LinkedIn for sales, it’s best to refrain from diving straight into the subscriptions and learn the ropes of the network first. While you are at it, it’s also a good idea to give the LinkedIn Sales Navigator Demo a spin first to establish if the LinkedIn marketing software is worth investing in prior to enrolling for the subscription. This way, you are in a better position to tell if the potential benefits you stand to reap from Sales Navigator are worth the cost.",Linkedin Sales Navigator

The full workflow looks like this: Assumptions Copy The following asumptions are made in this workflow: You have synchronized the recording of opportunities in Salesforce and Gong.io such that Gong.io contains the ID of your Salesforce opportunities You are making use of the Gong.io transcription API, including use of 'trackers' to capture and record mention of your competitors You have set up a webhook trigger to receive the notification of Gong.io call events Workflow summary Copy The main points in this workflow are: The workflow is kicked off by a webhook which receives notification of a call taking place by Gong.io The call transcript is retrieved from Gong.io The competitors mentioned are pulled from the call transcript The competitors are looped through and formatted into a single line list The Salesforce opportunity ID is pulled from the Gong.io webhook trigger The Salesforce entry for that opportunity is then updated with the competitors in the relevant 'Main Competitors' field 1 - The Webhook Trigger Copy The workflow is kicked off by a Gong.io webhook trigger. The following is example output from such a trigger: The data from the trigger can be accessed by subsequent steps in your workflow using $.steps.trigger.body. jsonpaths 2 - Check the context of the Sales call Copy Before beginning you may need to run a check on the 'context' of the call. In this case we are using a boolean connector to check that it is not empty: An example webhook output shows that the context may have been set as a Salesforce account: 3 - Get the call transcript from Gong.io Copy Then, on the 'true' branch, - to get the details of the call we use the List call by date or call IDs operation, with the Call ID filter set to pick up the ID from the webhook with the $.steps.trigger.body.metaData.id jsonpath We can also set an 'Extended' Context for the call details, so as to pick up granular details of the call: Of key importance in this example is that we added Trackers, as this is what will include the mention of competitors. 4 - Filter competitor mentions from the call Copy We then add a List Helpers connector and use the Filter operation which can be used to extract objects from nested json data, by specifying the name of the object as Filter Criteria The Competitors object is within the content.trackers array: So we use the $.steps.gongio-1.calls[0].content.trackers jsonpath (we use [0] here because the call is a single result in a zero-indexed array of calls). And the Filter Criteria is set as 'Competitors' (note that it must be capitalized to exactly match the format in the call output) 5 - Loop through competitors mentioned Copy Now we want to start building a list of the competitors mentioned. To start the process, we need to grab them one-by-one by using a Loop Connector with the jsonpath set to $.steps.list-helpers-1.result[0].phrases This gets at the result from the List Helpers step: 6 - Add each competitor to a list Copy The next stage is slightly tricky - as you can see from the List Helpers output, each competitor is returned as an object in the list/array of 'phrases' and it has 2 pieces of data - 'count' and 'phrase'. We want to extract only the 'phrase' from each object and add it to a list. To do this we will use the Append to List operation of the Data Storage connector. From the above screenshot you will see that, in the Key box we have called the list 'competitors' and used the $.steps.loop-1.value.phrase. Crucially, we have also ticked the box which says 'If the list to append to does not yet exist, it will be created with the given value'. 7 - Filter opportunity to get Salesforce ID Copy Similar to step 4, we can use the List Helpers connector to extract the 'Opportunity' object from the trigger, which will make the Salesforce opportunity ID easily accessible: 8 - Get the competitors list Copy We can now retrieve the competitors list using the Data Storage Get Value operation for the competitors list compiled in steps 5 and 6: 9 - Concatenate the competitors list Copy Now we use the Text Helpers Concatenate operation to format the list into a single line of text. Note that we use , in the Separator box to make sure each competitor is separated correctly with a comma and a space. 10 - Add mentioned competitors to Opportunity in Salesforce Copy The final step is to add a Salesforce connector using the Update Record operation. The Record Type is set as 'Opportunity' and the Record ID picks up the Opportunity Id from the Filter opportunity List Helpers step using $.steps.list-helpers-2.result[0].objectId And, to update the 'Main Competitors' field, the $.steps.text-helpers-2.result jsonpath is used. On successful completion of a workflow run, the Salesforce opportunity will be updated with the competitors:",Gong.io

Sales Marketing,"Product Previously, sales teams had to collect customer data and manually record it down into their CRM tools, analyze it, discuss it, and then think about ways to implement it to boost their revenue. With Gong, all of that can be automated at scale. The Gong Reality Platform Source: Gong Gong captures conversations from video calls to phone calls, emails, and more — anywhere salespeople interact with customers or prospects. It allows users to toggle between multiple views of the company sales pipeline. This data originates from CRMs like Salesforce or Hubspot and is brought into Gong’s platform with partner integration. Depending on the persona (HQ or field rep), users can better understand the state of the sales pipeline, with the ability to segment on variables like the deal stage, team, account, and close date. Users can also see an abstracted timeline of customer interactions related to a given deal over time, with the ability to double-click into a consolidated view of customer communications for the opportunity. It also has AI-enabled notifications that can trigger warnings for low engagement and other indicators that may signal a deal at risk. Gong also generates deal insights on why deals are won or lost based on the number of contacts engaged, deal duration, deal size, number of calls, competitor mentions it parsed from communications, etc. It can also produce basic analytics of what strategic initiatives may have impacted closed-won and lost deals. Gong Forecast Source: Gong Forecasting gives teams visibility into their pipeline in order to deliver revenue predictability. It enables sales leadership to track deals for each team member, with an interface for users to update forecasts in real time based on sentiment tracked through the company’s NLP tech. Gong Assist Source: Gong Launched in November 2022, Gong Assist is an AI-powered system that automates tasks, monitors opportunities, and recommends the next steps at the right time to help salespeople win more deals. It provides email templates based on topics discussed in prior interactions, the ability to update the CRM straight from Gong without needing to click out, and shareable workflows with teammates to ensure customer success and end-to-end visibility. Integrations With integrations into CRMs, email applications, calendars, business intelligence tools and more, Gong’s platform provides a seamless experience bridging the commercial org including revenue operations, sales enablement, sales, and customer success. By bridging all the channels of seller-buyer interactions, and seller-stakeholder engagement, Gong captures a flywheel of information and recommends the next best actions in a way that can be integrated across an organization. Gong for Market Insights Market intelligence provides a view of competitor penetration at accounts; deals lost to competitors, customer feedback on products, as well as pricing perceptions. It also helps identify business risks early on, replicate best practices, and get ahead of emerging market needs. Gong for Coaching Source: Gong After ingesting calls and emails, Gong is able to measure and help sales teams optimize how they sell and parse spoken and written keywords to enable salespeople to quantify points of interest such as questions, keywords, and smart trackers. Teams can listen to each others’ recorded calls and annotate calls, enabling sales reps to have performance feedback integrated into a single place for current and future customer touchpoints. Users are given metrics such as talk time and monologue time to reference, and leadership is then able to track feedback across their teams. Market Customer Gong’s core customer personas include small, mid-market, and enterprise pre-sales, sales, and post-sales teams across a variety of industries, including financial services, media, staffing, technology, hospitality, and real estate. The company has over 3.5K customers. Some notable customers include Twilio, Pinterest, Webflow, ServiceTitan, Zillow, Linkedin, Hubspot, and Shopify.

Market Size The global sales intelligence market size was valued at $2.8 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $7.4 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 10.6% from 2021 to 2030. This growth can be attributed to the increasing demand for real-time customer insights and predictive analytics and the growing need for effective sales and marketing strategies. The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of revenue intelligence solutions as companies look to understand their customers better and adapt to the changing market conditions. The surge in demand for content optimization and data enrichment tools is expected to further drive the growth of the sale intelligence market. Competition Clari - Clari is a revenue operations company that provides end-to-end sales analytics and a forecasting platform. Its core strength is the support of revenue management, including pipeline management, forecasting, and deal review. Unlike Gong, its strategy integrates rather than replicates related sales technology categories such as conversation intelligence, sales engagement, and enablement. It was founded in 2013 and has raised almost $500 million in funding. Outreach - Outreach is a sales engagement platform that accelerates revenue growth by optimizing email, voice, and social interactions throughout the customer lifecycle. It wants to offer sales engagement, revenue intelligence, and revenue operations in a unified platform. It was founded in 2014 and has raised $490 million. Salesloft - Salesloft is a sales engagement platform that helps salespeople sell better to clients, which includes real-time monitoring of interactions to provide coaching, suggestions for supplementary content to enhance the pitch, and workflows to manage records and communications. It was founded in 2011 and has raised $245 million in funding. Aviso - Aviso is a sales forecasting and pipeline management company. It was founded in 2012 and has raised $60 million in funding. Chorus.ai - Chorus is a conversation intelligence platform for sales teams that can transform conversations into data and insights. It was founded in 2015 and raised $100 million in funding. ZoomInfo acquired it in 2021 for $575 million. InsightSquared - InsightSquared is another revenue intelligence platform that provides sales intelligence for forecasting, accuracy, and decision-making. It was founded in 2010 and has raised $50 million in funding. Mediafly acquired it in 2021. People.ai - People.ai helps sales, marketing, and customer success teams uncover revenue opportunities by capturing all customer contacts, activity, and engagement to drive actionable insights across all revenue teams. It was founded in 2016 and has raised $200 million in funding. Business Model Gong operates on a subscription model. All licenses offered by Gong are priced per recorded user. There is also a platform fee based on the number of users supported. How much it costs per user depends on the license type. They do not charge extra for any integrations. It does not disclose any standard pricing on its website. Per a third-party report, for a team of 100 users, Gong’s cost could be $149K for an annual subscription. The platform subscription is $5K, and the per-user cost is $1,440. Traction Gong has over 3.5K customers, including Twilio, Zillow, LinkedIn, Hubspot, and Shopify. It has 1.2K employees and offices in San Francisco, Tel Aviv, and Dublin. In 2023, Gong's revenue run rate hit $178 million. The company disclosed that ARR grew 2.3x from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, while net dollar retention reportedly reached 140%, in June 2021. An analysis by SaaS buying and management platform Vendr showed Gong moved into the top 10 software sellers by share of wallet at 1.38% in 2022. Valuation In June 2021, Gong raised $250 million at a $7.3 billion valuation led by Franklin Templeton, with participation from existing investors Coatue, Salesforce, Ventures, Sequoia, Thrive Capital, and Tiger Global. This Series E round brought the company’s total funding to $584 million. The company said in June 2021 that it had increased ARR 2.3x between Q1 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021 and reached 2,000+ customers. In 2023, Gong's revenue run rate hit $178 million. For comparison, competitor Chorus.ai was acquired by public lead generation database company ZoomInfo for $575 million in July 2021. As of February 2023, ZoomInfo trades at an enterprise value of $13 billion with $1.2 billion annualized revenue for FY22 for a ~12x EV to revenue ratio. Key Opportunities Learning and Development Gong’s platform already enables sales leadership to listen in on conversations and see which led to deals won or lost. Further optimizing its AI technology to automate and customize feedback in real-time during sales calls opens up opportunities in the adjacent learning and development category, where sales can adjust pitches as customers respond. This could help make its people intelligence tooling better and go deeper in performance management and improvement. Revenue Operations Given how integral its product is in the process and workflows of salespeople and sales leadership, Gong has the opportunity to expand into tech stacks of revenue organizations and start capturing workflows and align processes across marketing, account management, and customer support to become a more holistic platform covering the entire lifecycle of prospects and customers. Virtual Assistance While Gong primarily ingests data and derives insights for sales teams to act on, automating the action itself for use cases like follow-up emails and contracting may now be possible with recent developments in AI-generated text. Becoming an assistant that can take contextual actions would help make salespeople more productive and increase the value proposition of Gong to companies. It has already taken steps to leverage the recent developments in generative AI. It recently announced Gong Smart Trackers, a user-trainable system that goes beyond keyword recognition to understand the context of all customer conversations. Vertical Focus Training the platform’s models on industry-specific jargon as the company expands its reach can help Gong saturate its target segments in certain verticals faster. The company has already shown a desire to go deep vertically for sales conversation optimization by developing in-house transcription models for 70+ languages. Key Risks Product Momentum Competitors Chorus and Wingman have been acquired by public company ZoomInfo and private company Clari, respectively, and now have cross-selling and distribution advantages. Smaller players are rising with more focused and specialized products. Firms like Clari are looking to integrate better beyond the sales organization to create a full-service tracking tool. Avisio is taking a similar approach as Gong, raising the prospect of a price war. Microsoft and Salesforce are trying to replicate Gong’s success within their platforms. Gong is going to need to not only maintain momentum in its go-to-market across market segments and industries but also continue to accelerate product growth and expansion to take over more layers of the tech stack and workflows of sales teams. Platform Risk Gong relies on CRM systems like Salesforce and communication recording tools for importing sales conversations and activity into its platform for running the analysis. It sits downstream of those platforms to offer value to its customers. There’s a risk that native offerings of entrenched systems of records could reduce the need or competitiveness of Gong’s offering. Privacy Gong takes conversations, analyzes them, and gives feedback. This feedback goes to individuals, across teams and organizations, in an effort to share learnings. Many sales processes are highly confidential, and sellers and buyers deal with confidential information in some industries. A lot of customer discovery involves understanding pain points, which requires sensitive information-sharing from potential customers. This creates privacy concerns. Summary Gong is changing traditional sales with a revenue intelligence platform, leveraging AI to derive qualitative insights across voice and text sales channels. By complementing how legacy CRMs act as systems of record dependent on active user input, Gong optimizes for an autonomous end-user experience where reps and leadership alike can have a 360-view of the sales journey without needing to spend time on administration. The platform’s ability to service use cases across the revenue center and continued expansion of functionality for sales, customer success, marketing, product, and finance reflect Gong’s stickiness and successful GTM strategy. For a business that began as a vertical SaaS wedge, Gong’s growing horizontal sprawl indicates a successful, scalable integration of AI into everyday workflows. Gong’s growth and dependence on Salesforce is one to watch as it confronts a macroeconomic environment favoring consolidation.",Gong.io

Sales Marketing,"Clozd Interview Programs: More Than Just Win-Loss Brittany Moreland Use Case Ready to win more deals? Learn how we capture in-depth buyer feedback—and how it can transform your business. Book a demo If you’ve spent any time on our website or explored the world of win-loss analysis, you already know that Clozd was founded to help businesses uncover key trends and insights about why they win and lose business. While most of our clients engage Clozd for win-loss analysis, we have found several other applications of our interview services that have helped clients answer critical questions for their businesses. Let’s take a closer look at several examples: ‍ ‍Churn or “At Risk Client” Interviews: ‍A slight variation from a traditional win-loss interview program, this structure allows you to learn from actual clients who have discontinued (or may soon discontinue) their relationship with you. Interviewing both churned and at-risk clients who are willing to share their experience helps increase awareness of common issues that are driving customers away. Issues that cause clients to second guess their original decision can be addressed before the dreaded churn happens. ‍ Investment Opportunities: Investors need to be confident that the companies entrusted with their money are delivering a valuable product or service. Investment firms benefit considerably when they engage win-loss services to perform interviews with customers and prospects of target companies. In conjunction with their sophisticated predictive financial models, customer and prospect interviews can help confirm the right investment opportunities. ‍ New Product Lines (Up-sell Opportunities): ‍If you’ve recently added a new feature, product line, or enhancement to an existing product or service, it may be difficult at first to tell how this new offering might be received or the best way to communicate its added value to your customers. Interviewing your existing customer base about their decision to add (or not add) the new feature or product is a great way to determine what is and is not working when marketing these solutions. This and other strategies can make win-loss particularly relevant to product marketing professionals. ‍ ‍ Partner or Reseller Interviews: ‍Companies who sell products or solutions through channel partners, distributors, or resellers want to be sure those partners are the right fit. After all, mistakes made by partners can tarnish the reputation of the company behind the product. Likewise, partners want to be sure the solutions they are selling have been developed properly, and that the terms of their relationship are beneficial to both parties. Partner interviews help both players evaluate strengths and opportunities for improvement. ‍‍ New Market Entry: Clients who want to examine the potential for new market entry speak with people in a new geographic market or business vertical to assess the promise of that opportunity. These interviews can shed light on what potential buyers’ priorities and thoughts are regrading an ideal solution, even if it doesn’t exist yet. ‍ ‍Blind “Competitive” Interviews: ‍A spin on the traditional win-loss interview, the blind “competitive” interviews is an interview of a prospect who recently evaluated your solution against several competitors. As we outlined in another recent post, a blind interview program does not let the interviewee know who is behind the study and offers an opportunity to understand a “30,000-foot view” of the relative performance of multiple competitors. ‍ ‍Customer Journey Interviews: Customer journey interviews look closely at each of the touch-points a customer has with your team throughout their time as a customer, from initial sales interactions, to implementation and training, to ongoing support. Clients typically choose this type of interview program to learn at which points along the journey their teams are offering an outstanding customer experience and where they can improve. ‍ Clozd has conducted interview programs in all of these areas. Even when our clients are not conducting a traditional win-loss program, the feedback we get from their clients and prospects helps them to improve and ultimately grow their wins while experiencing fewer losses. If you’d like to uncover why you’re winning and losing business -- in your customers’ own words -- get in touch to learn how a Clozd interview program can help.

Sales Marketing,"The Impact of Launching a Win/Loss Interview Program Read Time 9 min read Share this post: Standing up a win/loss interview program is an essential step in a company’s maturity, and it should happen sooner than many people think. Win/loss interview programs are one of the most important ways to gather actionable market intelligence. Yet many organizations don’t have a consistent interview process in place, either because they’re not convinced of the value or because they believe sales data is enough to understand the market and drive potential growth. In fact, the interview program is a separate but complementary activity that’s led by the product team and delivers a depth of market insight sales data can’t achieve by itself. In this GrowthBit, I’ll explain why I believe every product company beyond the early startup stage needs a robust win/loss interview program as a means to mature and scale their operations. What is a win/loss interview? A typical, sales-driven win/loss program collects and analyzes quantitative pipeline data, including funnel analysis, sales cycle, and close rates by segment. This data is valuable, but if the program doesn’t go beyond these metrics, you’re missing a big part of the picture and you run the risk of making decisions based on the opinions of your sales reps or most recent customers. Win/loss interviews help you round out the picture. Along with tools such as net promoter scores (NPS), customer satisfaction scores (CSAT), flash surveys, analysis of support tickets, UI focus groups and advisory boards, win/loss interviews help the company refine product-market fit at scale. They collect data from a broader cross-section of your market — including those who buy, those who stall out and those who go to competitors — in order to seek out the “why” behind the buying decision. Essentially: why do you win or lose? Why does a customer buy your product? Why don’t they? If they choose a competitor, why is the competitor’s offering more compelling? That data is then used to improve R&D, refine product-market fit and drive growth. How to stand up a win/loss interview program Standing up an interview program is an essential step in a company’s maturity, and it should happen sooner than many people think. Here are the key components. Assign an interviewer. Product management is well suited to this task because they’re furthest from the sales process and typically do not have a relationship with the buyer. This helps ensure the question phrasing and notes collected are unbiased. Third-party firms can also be a good option due to their independence, although using one does not help build this core competency within your company. Sales, marketing, and customer support often have a history with the buyer, which can negatively influence the quality of the data. As such, I would not recommend customer-facing staff for win/loss interviews. Centralize the data. Collect quantitative and qualitative interview data by creating discrete picklists in the CRM for each opportunity along with free-text notes. Having a common repository also gives easy access for sales, marketing, product and other departments who may make good use of this market intelligence. Build reports. Aggregate picklist responses to identify trends, summarize free text to capture more nuanced insights and consolidate both types of data into quarterly reports. Standing up a win/loss program is an important step in becoming a market-driven organization. Benefits of launching win/loss program I believe the ROI for win/loss interviews is significant. It enables the organization to quickly summarize why they win and lose deals by vertical market, segment, customer size and other dimensions. One recent study from 2020-2023 showed that win/loss interviews improved close rates by 23%.1 This is strong evidence for the value of this information across the organization, from R&D to the go-to-market functions. Here are three valuable outcomes you’ll see by launching a win/loss program. Evolution to Market-Driven Product Development: How? Product development for startups tends to follow one of three patterns: engineering-driven, sales-driven, or customer driven. These are all important sources of product input, but as companies scale, overreliance on one model can lead to problems. Standing up a win/loss program is an important step in becoming a market-driven organization.",Clozd
Sales Marketing,"Unlocking Sales Success: The Power of Win-Loss Analysis in CRM swirled squiggle accent Companies rely on their sales reps to track win-loss reasons in the CRM. There’s just one problem, your CRM’s closed-lost reason might be wrong 85% of the time. After conducting 1,000s of win-loss interviews and surveys for their customers, Clozd determined the best way to get the truth is through a win-loss analysis. ‍ Join Brandon Bussey, Founding Partner at Unicorn Revenue Operations, Spencer Dent, CEO and Co-Founder at Clozd, and Camela Thompson, Founder at Camela Thompson Creative, as they share win-loss analysis best practices that will help you understand your customers better while also increasing your win rates. ‍ “Win-loss analysis allows you to give the voice of the buyer to the rest of the org. You don’t have to play a game of telephone.” - Spencer Dent ‍ Are you struggling to improve your win rates? Most of us search for a solution by trawling through CRM data, which can be tedious and rife with inaccuracies. A win-loss analysis, the practice of systematically capturing and analyzing the reasons you won or lost sales opportunities, can give you the confidence to make strategic GTM changes. ‍ Spencer Dent, CEO at Clozd, a SaaS platform that plugs customer interviews and survey responses directly into your CRM, believes that a win-loss analysis is the best way to provide you with sales insights that can help you win more deals, faster. ‍ Securing buy-in to conduct a win-loss analysis ‍ “A lot of times, data doesn’t change minds, but stories do. If you can get the story from the customer, record it, and show people, it is so much more impactful.” - Camela Thompson ‍ To convince your executive team to spend money on a new vendor, like Clozd, bring their attention to the results companies see after conducting a win-loss analysis: reduced churn, improved customer retention, newly identified fertile pockets of business, and, especially, honing your product market fit and ICP. ‍ You’ll also need buy-in from across the organization. Start with your sales reps and make sure that they understand that the analysis is intended to help them sell more and make more money, not just add more work to their plates. ‍ Don’t forget to talk to your product managers to secure their buy-in. Ask them what they would like to find out from this analysis. New insights can help them prove theories they have about customer needs or plan out their feature roadmap. ‍ Best practices for a successful win-loss program ‍ Secure executive sponsorship - the best programs are top down initiatives where the C-suite is committed to understanding and adopting feedback Integrate your analytics with your CRM - Ensure that your win-loss analytics are accessible to all GTM teams Automate feedback collection - create a continuous stream of insights flowing back to all stakeholders for their review Communicate across departments - drive widespread adoption and share insights in real time Make it easy for reps - connect all customer feedback to the opportunity so reps can learn about their own deals and follow any strategic recommendations Mix it up - use a combination of surveys for transactional deals and interviews for strategic, larger deals ‍ Driving change with your results ‍ “You might know that your UI is a problem, but knowing that 80% of lost deals mention your UI as a factor will help you target your biggest problem first.” - Spencer Dent ‍ Many companies feel that they already understand why they’re winning and losing deals, yet still struggle to improve win rates. Unless you’ve been flying blind, a win-loss analysis shouldn’t bring any crazy surprises. Instead, the intent of a win-loss analysis is to confirm your hunches and give you the data you need to tackle whichever problems are holding you back from an improved win rate.",Clozd
Sales Marketing,"Using Win-Loss Analysis to Improve Sales Alignment Andrew Peterson improve Sales Alignment Because you’re reading this blog, your role likely involves making purchases (occasionally or frequently) on behalf of your company. Perhaps you’re a product marketer, product manager, or data scientist. Perhaps you recently negotiated the purchase of new software, outsourced a research product, or hired an agency to help with product or content design. Think back on one of your most recent evaluations: Did certain vendors make it easy to comprehend, evaluate and purchase their solution? Did others make it surprisingly difficult? Did you ask yourself why you had to work so hard to buy from them? Many B2B solution providers unintentionally (and unknowingly) complicate the sales process for their prospective customers. In contrast, savvy vendors align their sales process to the way the market wants to buy. They make it easy for prospects to comprehend, evaluate and buy their solutions. In other words, they achieve sales alignment. Examples of Sales Misalignment At Clozd, we conduct thousands of in-depth buyer interviews each year on behalf of clients. In a surprising number of cases, hiccups in the sales process impede buyers from purchasing a best-in-class product or solution. What are these hiccups? Some common examples of sales misalignment that we observe include: Not offering robust self-education resources. Today’s buyers want to educate themselves as much as possible before engaging directly with your sales team. Buyers often become frustrated or disillusioned if you make it hard for them to do their own research. They expect easy access to detailed and relevant information. If you don’t provide it, you may never hear from them. Making it hard to access knowledgeable staff. Once the prospect is ready to talk, they expect quick access to someone knowledgeable. They don’t want to jump through “lead qualification” hoops. Don’t make it hard for them to get on a call with a knowledgeable salesperson who can answer their questions and address their specific concerns. Not adapting or personalizing demos. Prospects like to self-educate, but they also want to see your product or solution in action. As Meagan Headley points out in another Pragmatic blog post, more than 75% of B2B buyers rely on demos during the sales process. But, since they have already done a lot of research, they don’t want a generic walkthrough. They want a tailored demo that addresses their specific use case and needs. Buyers grow impatient and skeptical when salespeople are unable (or too lazy) to fully customize the demo. Losing trust by how you communicate pricing. Spencer Dent, a former case team leader for Bain & Company’s salesforce effectiveness practice, pointed out in a recent interview that “buyers don’t like black-box pricing. They want to understand how you came up with the price and how it will change … The more upfront you can be about pricing in terms of explaining the model, the range and the drivers, the more trust will be built.” Not providing user reviews and referrals. Today’s buyers are used to having easy access to product reviews and user communities in a B2C context. They want to be presented with similar opportunities in a B2B context. Align with this expectation by offering to share relevant customer references, case studies, user reviews, and so on. Get them in touch with other smart clients who have tackled similar challenges using your solution. Diagnosing Sales Misalignment So, which (if any) of these misalignments are your prospective clients experiencing? The best way to find out is to regularly talk with recent prospects about their evaluation experience. These so-called “post-decision” conversations are commonly referred to as win-loss interviews and, ultimately, they’re the most effective method for diagnosing sales misalignment. Every B2B company should regularly conduct frequent, probing win-loss interviews with a sample of sales opportunities. If you don’t have the expertise or bandwidth to do them, then contract a third party for help. In each interview, talk with the buyer about their evaluation process and listen carefully to hear if hiccups in the sales process influenced their final decision. Some sales-related questions you may consider during a win-loss interview include: What was your impression of <company> after going through the sales process? What, if anything, was difficult or confusing during the buying process? How did you use <company>’s sales and marketing resources? What was it like working with the sales team? How well did they understand the needs of your business? How confident were you in their product knowledge and/or domain expertise? Did you interact with existing users or clients of <company> during your evaluation? If so, what influence did those interactions have on your final decision? How did your experience with <company> compare to your experience working with other vendors? If possible, record each conversation. Tag meaningful themes and quotes from each interview to help you track trends across interviews. Publish each interview in a format that is easy to share with colleagues and company leaders. By implementing a formal win-loss interview program you will gain clear and ongoing visibility into sales alignment. You will gain empathy for your buyers and the issues they are consistently running into. You will also benefit from their specific advice on how to fix them. The program will also help you to prioritize the sales alignment issues you hear against other win-loss themes that emerge (e.g., product gaps, messaging gaps, pricing issues). Then, you will be empowered with data and customer stories that can help get key leaders on board with implementing the right changes.

Sales Marketing,"How to Use Google Analytics to Track All of Your Marketing One of the things I admire about the small business owners I work with is the amount of effort they put into marketing their businesses. Most small business owners use a variety of different marketing channels including digital, print, direct mail, etc. Tracking digital marketing has become a fairly straightforward process, especially since online marketing and social media platforms like Facebook, Google Ads, and Twitter have built-in analytics tools. Plus, using Google Analytics to track those efforts is relatively simple to set up. When it comes to offline marketing, tracking the ROI can be a bit trickier. The good thing is you can actually use Google Analytics to track these efforts as well. This is one thing that I find most business owners aren’t aware of — and it is a missed opportunity because it can really help to increase the success of their marketing campaigns. In this article I’m going to show you how to use Google Analytics to track ALL of your marketing. Why use Google Analytics? The first, and most attractive, reason to use Google Analytics is that it’s free! Google Analytics is an extremely powerful tool and can provide you with key information you need to keep track of your marketing and understand what’s working and what needs improvement. One of the reasons Google Analytics is so effective is because it works well with other Google programs like Google Ads, Search Console, YouTube, and Google+. That means you’ll get all of that information in one place without the need to do any complicated tech work. Google is also here to stay. Unfortunately, some online tools go out of business and it can be a pain to have to switch to something new. It’s a pretty safe bet that Google will be around for a long time, and I like to stick with something that will be around in the future. Is your Google Analytics set up correctly? In order to use Google Analytics to properly track your marketing, you need to make sure it’s set up correctly. This can be done in four simple steps. 1. Add code to EVERY webpage. First, visit www.google.com/analytics/ and create an account. You’ll be given a code that you then need to copy on every page of your website. Here is an example of a Google Analytics code: <!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics --> <script async src=""https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-12345678-1""></script> <script> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', 'UA-12345678-1'); </script> 2. Set up Goals (conversions). It’s important to understand that traffic is not equal to sales. You can be driving a ton of traffic to your website, but if none of it is converting to sales for you business, then it’s not working. By setting up Google Analytics Goals, you can keep track of what happens to the traffic that comes to your site. You can set up your goals to track conversions such as online sales, contact form submissions, free report requests, or a phone call request. To do this, I recommend you use Destination Goals. The photo below walks you through the different steps needed to set this up (click on the photo to make it bigger). destination-goals-set-up 3. Use URL Builder to track your marketing campaigns. Google Analytics will automatically track a lot of your marketing campaigns right out of the box. However, it’s not 100% accurate unless you take this next important step – Use a specific URL that tells Google Analytics exactly where your traffic is coming from. Thankfully, Google’s URL Builder makes this easy to create. To use this tool, visit https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/campaign-url-builder/. Then, input the information requested for each of your campaigns so that you can easily track their success. Once Google Analytics generates the URL, you can use this in your campaigns and the URL will match fields in your Google Analytics reports. url-builder 4. Add E-Commerce Tracking. This step is critical for e-commerce websites in order to ensure that website sales show in Google Analytics reports. To do this, visit developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/ecommerce and follow the instructions on the page. What about offline campaigns? As I mentioned earlier, Google Analytics can be used to track ALL of your marketing campaigns including print, radio, TV, and direct mail. Doing this is fairly simple. First, add a Call to Action in your campaigns to visit a specific landing page. For example, if we wanted to advertise marketing tips on a TV ad, we might end the add saying “Visit MainStreetMarketingTips.com to get tips on how to market your business.” The URL here is a vanity URL, and makes it easy for listeners to remember what website they should visit. Then, using URL Builder we’d set up domain forwarding to track the vanity URL. For example, we could use URL Builder to set up the URL tracking link “utm_medium=tv” for vanity URL “MainStreetMarketingTips.com” and set up domain forwarding so that the vanity URL automatically forwards to the tracking link. If you go to MainStreetMarketingTips.com, then you’ll notice this particular vanity URL redirects to https://www.mainstreetroi.com/mainstreetmarketingtips/?utm_source=MainStreetMarketingTips.com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Email%2BNewsletter%2BSign%2BUp. In this case the utm_medium is “email” because we use this URL in some of our email campaigns. If that URL was used in a TV campaign then we would simply edit that tracking URL to include “utm_medium=tv” and Google Analytics would report on all of that traffic as coming from the TV marketing channel. The tracking URL would obviously be impossible for someone to remember on a television or radio ad, and would look messy on a print ad. The vanity URL looks nice and clean, and by setting up tracking for your specific campaign, you can see how successful your offline ad was at driving conversions. What reports should be considered? Once you’ve set up the proper tracking for both your online and offline campaigns, you need to start reviewing your analytics reports and analyzing the metrics. There are 3 steps I recommend taking: 1. Get a high level overview of your marketing. To do this, you want to look at the top marketing channels by traffic, top marketing channels by behavior, and top marketing channels by conversions. Start by using the Channels Report in Google Analytics. To run this report go to Acquisition > All Traffic > Channels. Once you run the report, you can get on overall view of your marketing by looking at each column. channel-report 2. Use Channel Specific Graphs. Generating a report for a specific channel will show the trends for the channel over time. This will help you to determine what’s working and what needs improvement. To do this, run the channel report above, then click on a specific channel. From there, you can choose to compare different metrics. In the example below, I created a graph that shows sessions vs. bounce rates for the display advertising channel. It clearly shows that at some point the bounces increased, which tells us that whatever happened to the campaign at that time — possibly a change to the targeting, ad copy, etc — isn’t working and needs to be fixed. 3. Generate reports for the top landing pages per channel. Running this report is important because it will help you to improve the top pages on your site that are visited by traffic from each individual channel. To do this, go to Behavior > Site Content > Landing Pages. Then, can click “Add Segment” and choose which marketing channels you’d like to review the reports on. Once you generate the report, you can look at traffic, behavior, and conversions for each landing page and get a better understanding of what landing pages are working, and which landing pages need to be edited. landing-page-report Conclusion Tracking all of your marketing helps to make sure you’re not wasting any of your marketing budget on campaigns that aren’t work. Using Google Analytics for both your online and offline marketing is a great way to ensure success, especially as you’re working on your marketing plan for next year.",Google Analytics
Sales Marketing,"What is Google Analytics and why is it important for digital marketers? Post author By University of Phoenix	Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) What is Google Analytics. As a website tracking tool, Google Analytics allows you to collect and analyze data about users and how they interact with your site. Over the years, Google Analytics has become one of the most popular digital marketing tools. World Wide Web Technology Surveys (W3 Techs) claims that “Google Analytics is used by 86.5% of all the websites whose traffic analysis tool we know.” Per its estimate, that amounts to 56.8% of all sites on the web. Google Analytics provides valuable information about your website — the foundation of your brand’s online presence — that you can use to guide your campaigns and assess the effectiveness of your marketing efforts. As the online landscape grows in size and complexity, these insights will become essential for both businesses and digital marketers to succeed. There are many learning paths and professional development courses you can take to develop your skills, but if you’re involved in digital marketing, you should invest the time to learn more about Google Analytics, what it does, and how it can benefit your organization. What does Google Analytics do? Google Analytics is part of Google Marketing Platform. It’s a freemium service, so there are both free and paid versions. The paid version, known as Analytics 360, comes with more features, and Google recommends it for enterprise organizations (those larger entities with hundreds or thousands of employees). For small and medium businesses, the free version will likely be sufficient. Both versions allow you to customize user data collection and obtain reports about your site and users in real time. Analytics can also integrate with other popular marketing tools including Google Search Console. To collect data with Analytics, you must put a JavaScript tracking code on the pages of your website. When a user comes to your site, the tracking code documents their behavior and attributes, such as how long they stay on a certain page and their age and gender. When the user leaves your site, that information is sent to Google Analytics for you to review. Benefits of Google Analytics Google Analytics provides a wealth of data and information that can benefit your campaign or business. Primarily, there are two main types of data: User acquisition data, which tells you where your users come from User behavior data, which reveals what users do on your site Keep in mind that not all users can be tracked. Some, for example, use anti-tracking browser extensions. Further, some user data cannot be recorded, such as personally identifiable information. Even with these limitations, you can still get an abundance of beneficial data out of Google Analytics, especially if you know what to look for and how to use the information you find. Channel overview Analytics provides data about all the different sources (or channels) of traffic coming to your website. The default traffic channels in the overview include: Direct traffic (when users navigate directly to your website) Organic search Social media Email Affiliate marketing Referrals Paid search Display traffic (traffic from displayed advertising) Traffic from other advertising sources Additionally, you can customize how the channels are grouped and displayed, so it’s easy to find the information you’re looking for. The channel overview simplifies your ability to see where your website traffic is coming from. You can compare the performance of different channels to each other and tailor your marketing efforts accordingly. For example, if you invested heavily in affiliate marketing but you get more visitors from social media, you may want to allocate resources to social media marketing instead. Conversion tracking You can use Analytics to track conversions on your website. You can set multiple conversion goals that correspond to different actions you want users to take, such as signing up for your email newsletter or making a purchase. While it’s important to generate traffic to your website, you also need to see how many users, if any, are converting once they get there. That way, you know whether your digital marketing efforts are having an impact on users. Customer engagement In Google Analytics, engagement is a broad term that describes any kind of user interaction with your site. This can range from the amount of time users spend on your site to the number of pages they visit in a session. You can use customer engagement data to gain greater insight into how customers behave on your website. This information can help you learn more about what your customers like, as well as what they don’t like, about your site and brand. Device overview Analytics can even tell you what devices people use when they come to your website, such as a smartphone, desktop or tablet. You can see what brand of device they use, as well as what operating system is currently on that device. This information helps you gauge the performance of different versions of your site. For instance, your site may work well for desktop users, but not for people who use Android smartphones, resulting in poor engagement and conversions among this audience. You can then make an effort to test and fix this version of your site, so it better serves those users. Collecting data for business goals Ultimately, the main benefit of Google Analytics comes from how you use the information it provides you. Make sure you have specific goals for your campaign or business. Then, use Analytics data to support those goals by making better-informed decisions about marketing and advertising. Without a purpose or vision, your data from Analytics will just be numbers on a screen. If you use that information aimlessly, it won’t be very helpful for your business. However, if you have clear and specific business goals, that data can go a long way in boosting your digital marketing efforts. Key metrics in Google Analytics In Analytics, “metrics” are quantitative measurements of your trackable data. You can then use “dimensions” to organize or categorize that data (such as by user location, marketing channel or specific campaign). Between metrics and dimensions, there are hundreds of different values you can track in Analytics. However, tracking that much data isn’t easy or feasible — even if your business can devote a significant amount of time and energy to it. It’s best to narrow things down and focus on only a few key metrics. Some of the most popular Analytics metrics include: Number of users: This is the total number of users who come to your website. One user is equivalent to one website visitor. Ratio of new-to-returning visitors: This metric shows how many users are visiting your site for the first time as well as how many users are returning to your site after at least one previous visit. Number of sessions: This refers to the number of times that a user comes to and engages with your site. Analytics defines a session as “a group of user interactions with your website that take place within a given time frame.” A single user can launch multiple sessions. Average session duration: This is, on average, the length of time a user spends on your site during a single session. This metric provides insight into user engagement. Average pages per session: This refers to the number of pages, on average, a user visits and views on your site during a single session. Average time on page: This indicates the average amount of time that users spend on a page of your site during a single session. You can find the average time on page for your entire website, as well as the average for individual pages. Bounce rate: This percentage shows the number of users who visit a single page of your website before leaving your domain altogether. In addition to tracking your site’s overall bounce rate, you can also view the bounce rate for individual pages. Google Ads: This report shows detailed information about the state of your Google Ads campaigns, including impressions, ad clicks and conversion rates. You must connect your Google Ads and Google Analytics accounts to access this information, and it may be valuable to take a separate course on Google Ads to get familiar with all the specific functions it offers beyond what you manage through Analytics. Search Console – queries: This shows how often your site appears in the search engine results page for certain keywords or queries. You do have to connect Google Search Console to your Analytics account, but this can help guide your search engine optimization (SEO) efforts for your domain. If you’re able to track more metrics, you will have more data available to inform decisions about your digital marketing. However, if you track too many, you run the risk of losing those insights in a sea of data. Ultimately, it’s best to identify and track the metrics that are most useful for your business or campaign goals. Should you get certified to use Google Analytics? Google Analytics is an essential tool that you need to know how to use, but it can be complicated and confusing, especially if you aren’t familiar with it. If you want to feel more prepared to use it for your business, it may be worth taking a course in Google Analytics. You can certainly teach yourself how to use Analytics, but it will likely take more time and be more difficult than learning through a course. What’s more, a course can help you get ready for the Google Analytics Individual Qualification (GAIQ) exam. If you successfully pass this exam, you will be fully certified to use Analytics — something that may be valuable for your professional development and future as a digital marketer.",Google Analytics
Sales Marketing,"How To Use Google Analytics For Marketing? Master Marketing Data With These 8 Key Strategies >Online Marketing>How To Use Google Analytics For Marketing? Master Marketing Data With These 8 Key Strategies Post author:Ananya Bajaj Post published:August 3, 2023 Post category:Online Marketing Google Analytics is a web platform offered by Google. Specifically, the site provides insight into statistics about website traffic, user behavior, and their impacts on conversion and retention. Marketers often rely on Google Analytics and its data reports to gain insights into a business’s online presence. They can test marketing campaigns, products, ads, and content to make correlations between user engagement and goals for the company. With this knowledge, businesses can make data-driven decisions that benefit the productivity and well-being of the business institution. Google Analytics offers important metrics that marketers utilize when analyzing their data and acting upon it to solve business obstacles. This article entails how to use Google Analytics for marketing through specific actions. What Are the Four Components of Google Analytics? Google organizes its web analytical service into four distinct sections. Notably, this segmentation makes it easier for marketers to understand how to use Google Analytics in marketing. To illustrate, here’s how Google divides the data: Audience This section helps you explore the qualities of your customers. Specifically, it analyzes demographics, geographics, and user interests, to create a customer profile or a target market for your activities. These metrics affect marketing strategies and efforts. By knowing more about your customers’ characteristics, you can make your marketing more meaningful and relevant. Providing current and fresh data to businesses about their customers will help ensure they meet the proper criteria. Ultimately, it also helps secure success. Acquisition This component attests to the channels your customers use to navigate the website or app. Channels like social media, emails, ads, and so on all produce customer traffic. However, knowing which ones generate the most is crucial to deciding which channel requires more time and effort. These reports not only track new customer behavior but also return customers.

Take a look at this article and get started! What Is a Metric in Google Analytics? A metric is a quantitative piece of data related to specific dimensions that are significant to evaluate the performance of a facet being looked at for a business. Metrics provide solid evidence of success that can be measured without errors or gaps. Both internal managers and external stakeholders manage these. In particular, they measure the effects of marketing efforts on audience actions. It is a way to test the present circumstances and improve future outcomes. Metrics are one of the most essential ways Marketers can use Google Analytics in Marketing. For a more in-depth explanation of metrics and how they work, refer to a more in-depth description in the article What Is a Metric in Google Analytics? [Explained] What is a Dimension in Google Analytics? Dimensions are attributes of your data. They organize, and segment data sets for better analysis and understanding. Dimensions include language, country, browser, medium, and device category. Each dimension is qualitative data that help sort traffic. When looking at the device category dimension, reports may include what type of device is used when your website or app is accessed, like a desktop, mobile, or tablet device. These are the values of the dimension and are calculations based on metrics. 8 Metrics to Focus on When Looking at Each Section There are metrics in each section that empower Google Analytics users to extract the necessary information from data. To explain, here are a few: Number of users and sessions The number of users is a calculation of how many unique visitors an online platform receives, and the number of sessions is the frequency of their visits. There could be 50 users and 100 sessions, implying that every user visited the site twice. These stats allow businesses to learn about their customer traffic and how aware the public is of their brand. Average pages per session This data informs analysts of the pages a user views when visiting the site. This information can depict how effective your pages are and shows a business how to capture user attention and what to do to improve it. Businesses communicate to their target market through online platforms like websites with an array of information that customers should know when browsing for what the company offers, whether its products or services. Ratio to new and returning visitors The comparison of new visitors to returning depicts how well your campaigns are working and test retention factors. Many conclusions can be drawn with a good ratio, like what strategies work best and how strong your clientele is becoming. It tells businesses the success of such strategies and helps them get to know their customer more for future marketing events. Organic vs. paid sessions The difference between organic and paid sessions is that one informs about customer traffic from non-paid searches, and the other is traffic from paid channels like commercials and ads. It shows how strong or weak your SEO strategies are and how persuasive your ad campaigns are. This data is crucial to understanding the success of financial and creative efforts in a business. All Google Ads metrics This metric requires you to link Google ads and Google Analytics together so businesses can be informed on an ad click or impression of their designed campaigns. Companies dedicate a set budget for marketing and advertising. Hence, testing their ads is crucial to not wasting resources and improving users’ impressions so more people click on advertisements and participate in other marketing campaigns. Newsletter user acquisition The newsletter opens toward email campaigns and assesses the reach of emails and initial engagement. They look at how many users the newsletter brought to the website. They prove successful content and deliverability. If open rates are low, users may find content not valuable. Businesses should maintain a positive reputation and not be marked as spam emails. Average Time on Page and Engagement Rate Analyzing the engagement rate on your website pages allows the creators to understand user experience and get feedback on what they can improve. The engagement rate is measured in user sessions, which is how long a user engages with your website or app. To calculate the engagement rate, you must divide the number of engaged sessions by the total number of sessions over a given time and then convert it to a percentage. According to Google Analytics Help, “An engaged session is a session that lasts longer than 10 seconds, has a conversion rate, or has at least two pageviews or screen views.” This analysis answers questions about their content and if it is relevant to their target market. A high engagement rate results in low bounce rates as users find the website useful or entertaining and stay longer. Goal conversion rate A website has predetermined standard objects, including purchases, a subscription, the number of visitors, and the average time on page downloads. Over time this depicts how well your marketing strategies work towards a business’s goals. Factors that lead to success or failure can be identified and guide future decisions.

Sales Marketing,"Google Analytics 4 Pros and Cons When most think of web tracking, they typically think of Google Analytics. After all, it’s been the go-to data collection analytics tool for years. Google Analytics 4, or GA4 as its often known, is the latest iteration of this web analytics platform. In this post, we’ll dive into the Google Analytics pros and cons so you can see if it’s right for you or if another analytics tool makes more sense. google analytics 4 Source: MarTech Pros GA is great for basic tracking and to gain a general sense of your site's traffic. Google Analytics may fit the bill if your main focus is on what browser types, operating systems, and device types are visiting your site. In addition, they offer a free plan that has up to 20 custom non-Personally Identifiable Information (PII) properties. Adding the code to your site is relatively straightforward as well. Like many trackers, you'll add the JavaScript snippet to your site to start tracking. google tag code Source: Data Driven U Pro #1: It's Free The cost of analytics can vary significantly, depending on a company’s size and specific digital marketing needs. Some digital analytics platforms cost thousands or even hundreds of thousands per month. But most small to medium-sized businesses pay at least a few hundred per month. Just like many other Google platforms, like Google BigQuery and Google Sheet, Google Analytics 4 is a robust tool featuring machine learning that generates accurate marketing data for free. And that’s one of the biggest draws. While this Google product isn’t as comprehensive as some other paid web analytics platforms, it’s still enough to get the job done for many marketers. With a Google Analytics account, you get a real-time data stream that features key information you need to make data-driven decisions. As we mentioned before, this includes browser types, operating systems, and device types, as well as detailed data on website traffic behavior, page views, time spent on site, bounce rate, Google Ad data (if you sync it), and more. Although Google Analytics 4 won’t be suitable for all website owners, such as some companies on the enterprise level or those that want end-to-end customer journey data, it still provides a high level of insight into user behavior and is more than adequate for many marketing campaigns. Pro #2: It's Used Universally It’s no secret that Google Analytics 4 has the bulk of the web analytics market share. According to recent data from W3Techs, 55.3% of all websites use Google Analytics 4, which is dramatically higher than most competitors. google analytics vs adobe analytics adoption Source: W3Techs For perspective, a major Google Analytics alternative, Adobe Analytics, only has 0.1% of the open web analytics market share. And it’s this ubiquity that makes it a popular choice for many marketers and website owners. Regardless of what industry you’re in or the size of your business, Google Analytics 4 can be quickly and easily integrated into your marketing campaign. It’s a simple tool to set up. All you have to do is create a Google Analytics account, configure your user ID data sharing settings, create a property to measure data, and insert a tracking code. From there, you just need to provide some basic information about your business, agree to Google’s terms and conditions, and finalize your Google Analytic account. At that point, you can access your Google Data Studio, set up event tracking, and start generating insightful information. Pro #3: It Has Out-of-the-Box Reports Another big benefit of Google Analytics 4 is that it’s ready to be used right away and doesn’t require any extensive setup. Unlike many other web analytics platforms that need to be heavily modified or customized and demand special configurations, Google Analytics 4 has out-of-the-box reports. google analytics report screenshot Source: Search Engine Journal That way, you can quickly gain valuable insight without having to do any heavy lifting on your end. If you host your site on a platform like WordPress or WooCommerce, you can use Google Analytics Pro to simplify the process even more. And when used along with Google Search Console, you can generate highly detailed data on your search engine performance with ease. This, in turn, makes for an extremely straightforward user experience and is ideal if you either A) don’t have the technical know-how to set up a complicated analytics platform or B) don’t want to deal with the hassle of an extensive setup process. For that reason, Google Analytics 4 can be a good fit for marketers at all different levels of technical expertise. Cons One of Google Analytics 4's main issues comes from its use of anonymous data. Anonymous Data GA4 focuses on anonymous data. This is a significant issue. Most other platforms are based on email addresses such as CRMs, marketing tools, or online shopping platforms. This means it's near impossible to match any of this data up with data from Google Analytics 4. Also, if you place a large emphasis on personalization where you need detailed information on individual users and the specific actions they take, anonymous data likely won’t be a good fit. This is especially true if you want to optimize every single touchpoint to enhance the user experience. Con #2: Issues Migrating from Google Universal Analytics If you’re starting with Google Analytics 4 from scratch, the set-up process should be fairly seamless, as we mentioned before. However, if you previously used Google Universal Analytics, you’ll likely encounter friction when making the migration. Universal Analytics vs Google Analytics 4 Source: Sphere Partners As of July 1, 2023, websites using Universal Analytics began no longer processing website traffic, forcing users to make the switch to Google Analytics 4. Unfortunately, many people that fall into this camp have complained of difficulties with data migration. As Search Engine Watch explains, “Migration is a complex process and should be planned carefully, and Google Analytics 4 does not make it any easier. Without data or tag migration, all historical data from Universal Analytics will not be transferred to the new platform.” While this can present problems for companies of all sizes, it’s especially burdensome for bigger ones that need to make a large-scale migration. Con #3: Major Interface Changes from Universal Analytics Besides the pains of migrating from Universal Analytics to Google Analytics 4, many users have complained of struggling with adapting to the new interface. While changes to any new software interface are normal and to be expected, the shift to Google Analytics 4 has been especially disruptive for many Univeral Analytics users. There have been significant changes to what marketers were using in the past with Universal Analytics and how the platform handles data collection. Some examples include buttons being moved and resizable columns that have made it difficult to see which existing functions are available and what new functions have been added. While most marketers will, in time, get the hang of the new interface, especially with Google Analytics Academy, they may struggle to fully leverage their Google Analytics data initially, which can create disruptions to workflows. This too is something to keep in mind if you were using Universal Analytics in the past. Con #4: Limited Data Reporting Also, Universal Analytics users that are accustomed to collecting a wealth of marketing data may be frustrated with the new iteration of the platform. That’s because Google Analytics 4 can only collect limited data, which means it doesn’t always tell the whole story behind visitor interactions and behavior. “While UA focused on sessions and page views, GA4’s measurement model is purely event-based,” writes MeasurementSchool. And although GA4 does have alternative metric options that can be helpful for understanding visitor behavior and you can use a separate platform like Google Tag Manager, “these metrics are entirely new, which means you can’t compare them to previous data if you haven’t used them before.” They also mention that Google Analytics 4 only offers three types of engagement metrics reports, which is dramatically less than what Universal Analytics offered at 30. The bottom line is that you’ll likely encounter limitations to data reporting, at least when compared with using Universal Analytics. When choosing a tracking platform that never uses sampling and focuses on individual profiles, Woopra is a much better alternative. How Woopra Compares If you’re in the market for a comprehensive marketing analytics solution tool that shows the entire customer journey throughout the sales and marketing funnel, Woopra should definitely be on your radar. ewoopra screenshot Woopra's platform helps you understand the complete end-to-end user journey across your site or platform with a laser focus on individual behaviors.

Sales Marketing,"How does Google Analytics work? Google Analytics is a popular web analytics service. It collects website data and turns it into valuable reports that tell you how your website is performing, such as who your visitors are, how they got there, and how they engage with your site. ‍ Although many web analytics tools are available, Google Analytics is the most popular. ‍ Like anything else in life, it has both pros and cons. This article will discuss what we love about Google analytics and what we feel are the cons, especially for the small business owner or entrepreneur. Google Analytics Pros 1. An excellent free tool While you can purchase a monthly subscription to Google Analytics 360, the freemium version known as Universal Analytics is entirely free. ‍ There's not much you can get for free these days, and the fact that Google has provided such powerful analytics software without charge is pretty incredible. ‍ How many website or blog owners will find themselves in the dark without a free analytics option? We'd have no idea what our customers look like or how they discovered us. At best, our online marketing efforts would be a shot in the dark. ‍ Let's all take a moment to say, Thank you, Google, for the freebie. ‍ Photo by Andrea Piacquadio - Pexels ‍ 2. Simple to set up Assuming you've successfully created and set up a blog or website for your business, connecting Google analytics should be a walk in the park. This perk is especially true if you've used a website builder like Wix or WordPress. ‍ Once you've signed up for a Google Analytics account, copy and paste your unique tracking code into your website, and you're good to go. ‍ 3. Provides out of the box reports and web analytics If you're too busy to spend hours researching and setting up custom reports, Google Analytics has default reports that provide a simple analysis of your site. ‍ The four main reports are Audience, Acquisition, Behavior, and Conversion. You can find these on the left side of your dashboard. For the simplest version, you can click to see the overview of each. ‍ The audience overview report will tell you the number of page views, average session duration, and the percentage of new versus returning visitors. ‍ The acquisition report helps you determine where your traffic is coming from. Is most of your traffic from organic search, social media platforms, or paid advertisements? The Behavior report tells you more about what a user does while on your site. ‍ Lastly, the Conversion report shows stats like goal conversion rates and E-commerce revenue. ‍ There's also the option to create custom reports or edit existing ones to suit your business goals for more advanced users. . A marketing team handling multiple projects at the same time Photo by fauxels - Pexels ‍ 4. Manages multiple properties (that's websites to most of us) under the same account ‍ If you're managing analytics for multiple clients or personal websites, there's no need to set up a Google Analytics account for each site. Google Analytics makes it possible to keep all properties under one account and even view metrics for different areas on one dashboard. ‍ Each analytics account can have up to a whopping 100 properties. That's a generous amount for a completely free platform! 5. Ability to dive deeper into website data if you're interested ‍ Universal analytics provides a massive amount of data collection if you have the time and know-how to access it. This feature makes it great for both novices who want simplified data and advanced users. ‍ An example of an advanced feature is event tracking. Although it's helpful to know how long a user spends on a page, wouldn't it be nice to know what they do? ‍ Event tracking allows you to track and collect data like video engagement (when the video plays, pauses, stops, etc.), how far down the page they scrolled, and PDF downloads, to name a few. ‍ Do you want to know another cool advanced feature? Enhanced e-commerce. Here, the product takes center stage, and reports are generated based on which products people view. Then, they are added or removed from carts, product revenue, etc. . Three men having an animated discussion about advanced Google Analytics reports Photo by Karolina Grabowska - Pexel ‍ 6. Regularly updates with new features Google Analytics is constantly updating and adding new features. Although for those who aren't so tech-savvy, this could be considered a negative. A prime example of this is the introduction of Google Analytics 4. By 1st of July 2023, GA4 will replace Universal Analytics completely. Will the replacement be an improvement? No doubt, but it does mean you'll be spending a good few hours exporting accurate data and getting comfortable with the new features. 7. Tells you how people found your site Photo by Canva Studio - Pexel ‍ ‍ Knowing where your web traffic originates means you can concentrate your resources where they work best. ‍ Direct traffic tells you how many visitors landed on your site by directly typing your URL into their browser. ‍ A customer, for example, could have heard about your website over the radio, read an ad, or see a sign. This type of traffic is a good indication of how well your more traditional marketing methods work. ‍ Organic traffic refers to visitors who found your site by typing a search query into a search engine. A high percentage of organic traffic means your SEO efforts, such as optimizing content with well-chosen keywords, are paying off. ‍ Paid traffic is another way, where the percentage of visitors who land on your site after clicking on an ad. Measuring performance becomes increasingly crucial as more resources pour into adverts and inbound marketing. ‍ This type of traffic is an excellent indication of how well your ad marketing campaign performs and how you should focus your resources. ‍ ""Google Analytics was too complicated.

Shows you real-time traffic data The Real-time reports allow you to see who is on your site right now and what they're doing there. How is this useful? ‍ Let's say you're running a one-day-only campaign. Real-time reporting lets you see how many users click through to the promotion turn into paying customers. ‍ Or perhaps you have a blog with daily posts. This data can tell you which of the new content is most popular. 9. Offers an abundance of freely available resources Google Analytics Academy is a free online series created by Google to help you learn both basic and advanced software features. ‍ Google Analytics for Beginners covers topics like how to create an account, implement tracking code, analyze basic reports and set up goals. The advanced video series teaches you to set up advanced filters and how to create custom metrics and dimensions. There's also a handy introduction to Google Tag Manager and Data Studio. ‍ For the most up-to-date information, you can consult the Google support website, type in your query, and hopefully, it will solve the problem. ‍ Since Google Analytics is such a popular platform, there is no shortage of blog articles, community forums, and Youtube videos to answer any questions which may pop up. There is no person-to-person support center, as discussed under the cons. ‍ Follow the path of visitors to your site. By using the Behavior Flow report, you'll be able to see how visitors move or navigate through your website. Which page did they start on, where did they go next, and which page did they exit? ‍ This information helps you assess which pages are most engaging and may need some work. Could adding a video or images hold their attention longer, or could you include a CTA button or link to another page to encourage further browsing? What are the cons of google analytics? 1. A steep learning curve Photo by iNFINITY ADVENTURE NEPAL - Pexel ‍ Google analytics provides almost too much information, which can be overwhelming to new users. It takes a long time to learn and fully understand all the reports and metrics. ‍ Not all of us want to spend hours learning how to decipher website analytics. Also, not many small businesses have the budget to employ someone who knows what they're doing. This tool puts many entrepreneurs and small business owners in a tricky situation. ‍ The solution? Why not try a web analytics tool specifically created with you in mind? Abralytics is a reasonably priced, monthly subscription service that works hard to simplify reports and provide you with focused, meaningful data. ‍ Click here for a free 30-day trial. 2. It's a bit of a mouth full. When you first start using Google Analytics, you may constantly be Googling unfamiliar terms. Not everybody intuitively knows the difference between a metric and a dimension or a conversion and an event. ‍ Even entire blog articles provide you with a glossary of Google Analytics terms. It can take hours to understand the jargon, and while you may feel brilliant afterward, the whole process can be pretty frustrating. ‍ 3. Data sampling Google has to process an enormous amount of data from millions of websites. To reduce the volume of processing, they may do data sampling. They analyze only a portion of your website's data and apply it to all your visitors. ‍ Google describes data sampling this way: ‍ Image created in Canva by M.D. ‍ Does it make sense? Yes-when we're talking about trees. But data sampling won't provide the most accurate data about what's happening on your site and who your site visitors are. While trees may be pretty similar, the behavior, likes, dislikes, and demographics of people differ significantly. ‍ Fortunately, sampling doesn't happen when making use of the default reports. Custom reports will apply if you've modified a default report. 4. Gives a limited number of hits per month A hit is any interaction a user has on your site sent to Google. A hit could include a page view, a form submission, an e-commerce transaction, etc. ‍ One visit to your site may result in multiple hits being sent and analyzed by Google, and the free version is limited to 10 million a month. Once you've reached the limit, it will no longer track anything over 10 million, and you'll be asked to sign up for the paid version called Google 360. 5. Doesn't comply with E.U. data protection laws ‍ Photo by Monica Turlui-Pexel ‍ If you operate a site in any European country, it may be more difficult, sometimes impossible, for you to use Google Analytics on your site. ‍ Google saves data and personal information about E.U. residents, and everyone else, on servers in the U.S. However, they do not provide an adequate level of protection according to E.U. standards, so they are not GDPR (General data protection regulation) compliant. ‍ The good news is that there are a host of other web analytics tools available that are GDPR compliant from the very start. Abralytics, for example, is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR straight out of the box. ‍ 6. Lack of customer support Photo by Andrea Piacquadio - Pexel ‍ Unfortunately, customer support is only available for the paid version, Google analytics 360. ‍ When Google analytics users encounter a problem, you'll need to rely on Google's support website, online forums, or Youtube videos to resolve them. This process can be frustrating as the Google Analytics platform changes so often that it is often difficult to find up-to-date information. ‍ 7. Spamming of G.A. reports Photo by Pavel Danilyuk-Pexel ‍ Although Google works tirelessly to block spammers, the spammers work equally hard to find a way around it. Google Analytics is a free platform used by millions of websites, making it extremely attractive to spammers. Spambots send fake data to Google Analytics servers, known as Ghost spam. Spam and any other irrelevant traffic lower the accuracy of your reports and can indirectly affect your SEO. If the data you are analyzing is inaccurate, it will be challenging to make meaningful decisions. What's the point, you may ask? Below is a diagram that shows how spammers benefit from infiltrating Google analytics data: ‍ Google Analytics Spam Purpose Sourced from carloseo.com ‍ 8. Lack of organic keyword data Wouldn't it be helpful to know which keyword or phrase led the person to your site? Absolutely! ‍ Unfortunately, Google Analytics provides very little keyword data, so it may be better to find a platform that combines the two features - both keyword and traffic data reports. ‍ Top Tip: Another free tool from Google is Google Search Console which can easily integrate with Google analytics. ‍ Google Search Console helps you see how your website is performing and can provide a list of the top search queries which brought visitors to your site. This tool is an excellent alternative if you don't have the budget for an all-in-one subscription. ‍ Photo by Andrea Piacquadio-Pexel ‍ 9. Too much talk, not enough actionable insights As mentioned, Google Analytics provides you with an enormous amount of data. You can spend a lot of time analyzing data and not thinking enough about what the data means. For example, the data may show that visitors to your site are not staying there long enough. It's a fascinating insight, but what does it mean? Google Analytics is only as powerful as you make it. It doesn't think for you - you'll have to find ways to use the reports as a basis for decision-making. The Bottom Line Considering it's completely free, it's a great tool to add to your arsenal. However, the real deciding factor will be how much time and energy you want to invest in learning how the platform works. For smaller businesses, the time it takes to learn how to decipher reports may not be worth it when simpler alternatives are available. You'll need to be content with the hit limitations and possible data sampling for medium-sized businesses. And for larger companies, you'll need to decide if you'll be willing to take the next step and pay for Google analytics 360. Happy analyzing! ‍",Google Analytics
Sales Marketing,"Pros and Cons of Google Analytics 4 Appinessworld Appinessworld · Follow 3 min read · Nov 24, 2023 GA4 is yet another significant Google release (Google Analytics 4). Google announced on March 2022 that Universal Analytics will be sunsetted by July 2023. This implies that by that time, everyone using the universal analytics will have to upgrade to GA4. Google Analytics, also known as Universal Analytics, is a platform that gathers information from your websites and apps to provide reports that offer insights for your organization, whereas GA4 is the most recent and advanced version. What is GA4? GA4 (Google Analytics 4) is the latest version of Google’s web and analytics platform, offering a more comprehensive and advanced set of features compared to Universal Analytics. While Universal Analytics focuses on tracking individual user interactions and collects data from your websites and apps to create reports that provide insights into your business, Google Analytics 4 takes a more holistic approach, incorporating machine learning and AI to provide a more complete understanding of customer behavior across channels and devices. In this blog, let’s get into what are the pros and cons of GA-4. Pros of GA-4 Easy to Implement: Creating a GA4 property is simple when done through Google Tag Manager (this is still the preferred and recommended practice). Google Tag Manager has its configuration tag for GA4 that functions like the global site tag and fires first on every page. Enhanced Measurement: Enhanced Measurement is a new feature in GA4 that tracks pageviews for SPAs (single-page apps). You may have encountered a SPA as a website that features few but long, detailed web pages. Site visitors can interact with the pages but the URL will not necessarily change or reload with every interaction since it’s all one page. GA4 can now capture and report on that data whereas Universal Analytics has its limitations in doing so as a session-based reporting system. Enhanced data privacy: GA4 offers improved data privacy features, such as automatic IP anonymization, that help protect user data and ensure compliance with data protection regulations. Improved cross-device tracking: GA4 uses a more advanced tracking technology that can better track users across different devices and platforms. Custom Audiences Automatically: When you create a custom audience in GA4, it automatically publishes to all other connectors like Google Ads, Optimize, etc. You no longer have to recreate each Audience in each connector because it automatically connects, thus saving you valuable time! Cons of GA4: Property Limits Still Exist: GA4 has set limitations on the number of properties users are allowed to create (just as with Universal Analytics). For the free version, users are allowed to create up to 25 registered user properties within a single property (the numbers are set to be higher for enterprise versions but we do not know what the cap is for those yet). Cannot Create ‘Views’ in the Free Version of GA4: Universal Analytics allowed users to create multiple Views within the same Property. Many website owners or webmasters did this for organization and testing purposes. For large websites that captured vast amounts of data, filtering out certain data points and reports into separate views made it faster to load the reports as well as easier to digest and analyze. Steep learning curve: GA4 is more complex than its predecessor Universal Analytics, and may require a steep learning curve for those not familiar with it. Limited support: As a new tool, GA4 may not have as much support and documentation available compared to older versions of Google Analytics, which could make it more difficult to troubleshoot issues or learn how to use the tool effectively. Limited integrations: GA4 may not integrate with all of the third-party tools and platforms that you’re currently using, which could make it difficult to fully integrate your analytics data.",Google Analytics
Sales Marketing,"What Are Advertising Features in Google Analytics? Analytics advertising features were a set of optional features in Google’s now-discontinued Universal Analytics (UA) platform. They offered access to useful data you could use to understand and improve the results of paid advertising campaigns. Advertising features in Google Analytics UA allowed you to: Create remarketing audiences based on on-site behavior or user demographic data and export the lists to use in Google Ads See user demographic and interests in reports and create audience segments with the data to analyze user acquisition or behavior in new ways Integrate Campaign Manager 360 to view and analyze Campaign Manager 360 data in their Google Analytics reports View Google Display Network (GDN) impression reports to view how many impressions your display ads received in Google Analytics reports Google Analytics 4 (GA4) replaced Universal Analytics in July 2023, so you can’t access the previous Analytics advertising features anymore. However, GA4 offers similar features for the needs of digital marketing advertisers. Google doesn’t refer to the features by a single name anymore. But, just like their predecessors, these features can make your advertising campaigns more effective. Access Everything You Need in One Platform with Semrush Get a FREE Trial → ADS illustration 4 GA4 Features for Advertisers Almost all of GA4’s features can help advertisers understand how their campaigns perform. But the following four analytics features in Google Analytics are particularly useful: Audience segments Custom events Google Ads link Google Signals and User IDs Here’s a simple guide to help you configure and use each one: 1. Audience Segments The audiences feature allows you to create custom user segments in GA4. This means you can categorize your users in ways that matter to your business. Categorizing audience segments makes it easier to analyze their on-site behavior and target them in Google Ads campaigns. Youtube video thumbnail You can create audiences based on diverse conditions. This gives you a lot of options. For example, you can use Audiences to create segments of users who have: Visited your site three or more times Viewed a specific blog post, product page, or landing page Clicked on your contact page but left without taking an action Purchased something from your ecommerce website Signed up for your newsletter And you can modify all these conditions with a time span. For instance, you can create an audience of people who viewed a certain product page within the last seven days. This modification helps ensure your audiences are relevant—not filled with past users who’ve already moved on. And, with Audiences set up, you can see them in standard GA4 reports. These reports help you focus on valuable user segments to see how you acquire them and what they do on your website. You can also access your custom audiences in any linked Google Ads accounts. With this integration, you can use them in retargeting campaigns, serving ads elsewhere on the Google Search Network or the Google Display Network to reactivate lapsed users. An infographic comparing ""Google Search Network"" and ""Google Display Network"" To create a new Audience in GA4, first click the “Admin” button in the menu on the left side of your screen. “Admin” button selected in the GA4 menu On the next screen, click “Audiences” in the Data display column. “Audiences” selected under Data display column in GA4 Admin There, you’ll see a list of your existing audiences. Even if you’ve never set one up yourself, you should see All Users and Purchasers listed. Click the “New audience” button to move on. “New audience” button selected in the top right corner under ""Audiences"" section The next screen offers options for how to create a new audience. You can choose an audience category pre-built by Google, like “7-day inactive users,” or select a template to simplify the process. ""Build new audience"" screen in GA4 If you want to do it from scratch, click “Create a custom audience.” You can then add conditions for your audience. To define your conditions, click “Add new condition” to reveal a drop-down menu. Then, browse through the options or use the search bar to find the right parameter. “Add new condition” highlighted under ""New Custom Audience"" window For example, the combination of conditions in the screenshot below would create an audience tracking users aged between 18 and 24, acquired organically, who spent 60 seconds or more on your site. ""Age,"" ""Session medium,"" and ""Session duration"" conditions set for custom audience There are countless combinations of parameters to choose from. This means you can create and track highly specific audiences. And you can also add parameters to exclude certain users. This includes people from a certain country or who use a specific device type. ""Country"" seto to ""United Kingdom"" under ""Exclude users when:"" filter When you’ve established your audience’s parameters, add an audience name and write a short description. Then, click the “Save” button to complete the process. 2. Custom Events Custom events in GA4 allow you to track and record specific user actions across your website. The flexibility of GA4’s custom events is one of the biggest upgrades over UA. They’re an addition to the events that GA4 tracks automatically. This lets you tailor the advertising features in Google Analytics’s platform to deliver detailed insights that can improve your advertising campaigns. Youtube video thumbnail GA4 automatically records a range of events, including: Page views Engaged users First visits File downloads Video views To track anything beyond these actions, you need to use custom events. What can you track with custom events? Just about anything you can think of. The event builder offers a lot of customizability, with a huge range of parameters to choose from. This means you can set events up to track actions like: Internal link clicks Product purchases Newsletter sign-ups Live chat interactions Website search queries Some of these are available as recommended events in GA4, meaning setting them up is relatively simple. Youtube video thumbnail Other events, particularly those that track complex user actions, you’ll have to build from scratch. To start the process, open up the admin menu by clicking “Admin” in the menu on the left of your screen. Then, click the “Events” option in the Data display menu. “Events” option selected in the Data display menu On the next screen, you’ll see all your existing events. If you’ve never set one up manually, these will be GA4’s automatically created events. ""Existing events"" section in GA4 Click “Create event” to start creating a custom event. On the next page, give your event a name, bearing in mind that you can’t exceed 40 characters. Then, you can start adding conditions. The parameters you can choose from offer practically limitless opportunities. The screenshot below shows a custom event setup that would record the number of times users visit a URL containing the phrase “thank-you,” for example. ""Configuration"" screen in GA4 showing a custom event setup that records the number of times users visit a URL containing the phrase “thank-you” Once you’re done adding parameters, click the “Create” button to complete the custom event setup process. You’ll have to inject an event analytics tag into your website’s code for more complicated events that existing parameters or events in GA4 don’t cover. There are several ways to do this using Javascript, including through the gtag.js API or Google Tag Manager. When your custom events are all set up, test them manually so they work how you expect. 3. Google Ads Link You can link GA4 with a Google Ads account to allow data to flow between the two platforms. This makes analyzing Google Ads campaign performance easier. You can learn more from the data in GA4, and make improvements that lead to better results. Youtube video thumbnail The benefits of linking your Google Analytics property and Google Ads account include unlocking the ability to: Analyze Google Ads campaign performance in the Google Ads campaigns report in GA4 Use Google Ads dimensions like cost-per-click in the user acquisition reports in GA4 Import GA4 conversion events into Google Ads for cross-platform conversion tracking Use custom audiences from GA4 in Google Ads remarketing campaigns These benefits make both platforms more useful in advertising campaigns. GA4 becomes a central hub for all the most important acquisition and user behavior data. Google Ads offers more opportunities for reaching your audience. Linking the two platforms is easy. Here’s how you do it: First, click “Admin” in the navigation menu on the left of your screen. Then, under the Product Links subheading, click “Google Ads Links.” “Google Ads Links” selected under the Product Links subheading in the Admin panel You’ll see any existing Google Ads links listed in the table. Click the blue “Link” button in the top-right to create a new link. ""Google Ads links"" section with ""Link"" button highlighted On the next menu, click “Choose Google Ads accounts.” A sidebar will open, showing all of the Google Ads accounts you can access through your Google account. Select the accounts you want to link, and click the “Confirm” button in the top right. ""Link to Google Ads"" section with ""Confirm"" button highlighted The next page will show some configurable settings. Personalized advertising, which enables the sharing of audiences and conversion events between GA4 and Google Ads, is on by default. Auto-tagging automatically allows Google to generate UTM parameters for your search ads’ landing pages, which makes attribution of performance to certain campaigns easier. You can review your choices and finalize the process when you’ve chosen your preferred settings. You should see Google Ads data start appearing in your GA4 property within 48 hours of creating the link. Further reading: How to Optimize Your PPC Campaign with Semrush 4. Google Signals and User IDs Google signals and User IDs are two ways to get more information about your website users and track them across different devices and platforms. These advertising features in Google Analytics give you a unified view of entire user journeys instead of seeing them fragmented into individual sessions. Both user tracking methods offer the same benefits but use different tracking methods. Here’s how each one works: Google signals tracks users based on their Google account, provided ads personalization is on. It also collects data, including the user’s location and Google search history. User IDs are identifiers you can assign manually to users with an account on your website. They allow you to track these users persistently across devices and separate sessions, as long as they’re signed in. You can use both types of user tracking together to get as complete a view as possible of your recurring users’ interactions with your website. Why is this important? These advertising features in Google Analytics offer valuable insights, like showing you how many times a user visited your website before converting, regardless of what devices they used in their journey. It also helps remove duplicates from your GA4 data, with tracked users only appearing as one user rather than each session appearing as a separate user. This is particularly useful for advertisers because users will often make multiple visits to your website before completing a conversion action. The concept of the marketing funnel covers this idea. An infographic showing a marketing funnel with ""awareness,"" ""consideration,"" ""conversion,"" and ""loyalty"" stages A user might first visit your site when they’re in the awareness stage, looking for product information. They might return several times as they consider their options. They’ll hopefully convert on their final visit. Without user tracking through Google Signals or User IDs, it’s impossible to see users complete this entire journey. But with it, you get complete visibility over the steps that led to their conversion. This makes it easier to tailor your advertising campaigns to target users at critical points in their buying journey. The process of enabling Google Signals is easy. Here’s how: Go to the admin section of GA4, under the Data collection and modification menu, click “Data Collection.” Data Collection” selected under Data collection and modification menu in the Admin panel You’ll see a toggle in the Google signals data collection box. Click it to turn Google Signals on. ""Google signals data collection"" box with the toggle on Adding user IDs is a little more complicated. To start with, you need to create unique IDs for users with an account on your website. Then, you have to ensure the user IDs get sent to GA4. This involves adding a code snippet to the config command in the Google Analytics tracking code installed across your website. Google has a short guide to carrying out this part of the process. Finally, back in GA4, you need to verify the identity reporting. Click “Reporting Identity” in the Property settings menu in the admin section and select the blended option. ""Blended"" option selected under the “Reporting Identity” section With both user tracking methods set up, you can do new things with the data in GA4. This includes comparing signed-in users’ behavior to non-signed-in users, creating audiences based on more granular demographic data, and generating remarketing lists to export to Google Ads. Other Ways to Boost Your Advertising Campaigns GA4 is a great platform for advertisers, offering lots of ways to collect, analyze, and share data. But it’s not the only platform that can add value to advertising campaigns. Semrush Advertising Research can round out your advertising software toolbox. However, there’s a key difference between GA4 and Semrush. GA4 only offers data from your website, meaning it can only tell you about your advertising campaign performance. Semrush, on the other hand, allows you to analyze your competitors. This makes it a perfect tool for complementing GA4 data. There are lots of ways to use Semrush Advertising Research to improve your advertising campaign results. Firstly, you can assess the competitive landscape by analyzing your competitors’ ad budgets and target keywords. Here’s how: Open the Semrush Advertising Research dashboard, enter the domain you want to analyze into the search bar, and click “Search.” Advertising Research tool On the next page, you’ll see a list of the keywords your competitor has paid search positions for, along with data estimating the amount of traffic they receive and how much it costs them.

This helps you get even more information to fuel your ad campaigns. ""Keywords"" bar highlighted under “Ads Copies” tab in Advertising Research Then, you can see what landing pages they drive traffic to with their ads when you click on the “Pages” tab. ""Paid Pages"" section in Advertising Research This is a great way to speed up the process of analyzing what the landing pages in successful ad campaigns look like.

Sales Marketing,"Top 5 Features Marketing Professionals Need to Know in Google Analytics “What gets measured gets managed.” – Peter Drucker Marketing Data Analysis Web analytics offer businesses the opportunity to improve their website by tracking traffic to identify trends and issues. Google Analytics is a simple and free way to begin to understand the possibilities of this developing area of marketing. While reviewing the free service I have distilled the vast amount of data available in Google Analytics down to five critical reports and features for every person responsible for a commercial website. 1. Visitor Flow This is the gold mine of Google Analytics. Users can break down their website traffic in fantastic detail. Here you can identify the most common path through your website. When problems become obvious – for example bottlenecks or use of the back button – everything from navigation terminology to server speed can come into question. Additionally, this feature can help identify dead-ends which cause visitors to leave the site. Users can review the number of visitor drop-offs at each click. This represents the visitors which did not make an additional click and went to another site. Typically drop-off rate increases as the number of clicks increases. This can be powerful evidence to adapt a site to have every page no more than two or three clicks away. 2. Advanced Segments Despite its name this feature does not have to be ‘advanced’ at all. The ability to segment the traffic into new and returning visitors is simple and allows for interesting comparisons. Are new users finding the site easy to navigate or are they clicking all over with no clear commonalities? What are the most common paths taken by returning users? If a large amount to traffic is arriving on the same page perhaps it’s time to put a link on the homepage to shorten the journey. 3. Date Control The date control feature in Google Analytics allows users to examine and compare traffic over specific periods of time. The potential for this feature is seriously underutilised. Many businesses know engagement and sales are subject to the cycle of the calendar yet how many alter their website in any significant way depending on the time of year? Limiting the traffic reports to a single month or even to a single week and then comparing year-on-year can allow users to tailor their sites to respond to changing customer needs. 4. In-Page Analytics I know of no other web analytic tool with a more powerful impact on those with budget control than In-Page Analytics. Even the least IT-savvy staff members can identify what areas are experiencing heavy traffic and which areas are under-performing. Nothing could be simpler than a window containing your website with an overlay displaying of the percentage of visitors who click each link. In-Page Analytics is best used to graphically communicate what is working and what is not. If you need to win budget spend to update your site In-Page Analytics is your go-to tool. 5. Referral Traffic Sources From where are your visitors coming? Is your Facebook campaign having any impact at all? Are staff blogs driving traffic? Again, this piece of information is simple but powerful. It can impact an entire marketing campaign. For example if staff are spreading the message too thin on a number of social media platforms then this data can show which platforms are showing real results. While an understanding of all traffic sources is important, referral traffic is king. Using the Data Once installed, a reporting system is necessary to inform website improvements. Identify the most important reports for your needs. Reports can be saved to a dashboard allowing quick access to key data rather than having to run each report as needed. To start I recommend monthly analysis as well as year-on-year comparisons. By analysing the data necessary changes will become obvious over time. For example, if your site is new to web analytics, there will be rarely used links on the homepage. Dedicate that value screen real estate to something your customers want. If you do not have in-house knowledge to alter your site Google Analytics will help make a clear case to spend on web development. In time and with some experimentation your website will be clear of clutter and optimised for discovery. Your customers will thank you.

Sales Marketing,"Why Is Google Analytics Important in Digital Marketing? by Sue Koch | Digital Marketing Strategy Could you imagine spending tens of thousands of dollars building a website for your business, then using digital marketing to drive traffic, leads, and ecommerce, and not having a way to measure the KPIs necessary to improve marketing strategy performance? That is what many businesses, big and small, are sacrificing when they fail to set up a tool like Google Analytics. At (un)CommonLogic, Google Analytics is the primary way we measure and evaluate the impact of our digital marketing campaigns for our clients. Not only is Google Analytics the most widely used analytics tool, but it serves our key goals in support of data-informed strategies: To ensure your marketing data is accurate and consistent To align your marketing metrics with your strategic business goals To build marketing reports that guide you in making data-driven decisions Let’s explore some of the critical pieces of marketing strategy that Google Analytics will help inform: Analysis of Audience Behaviors and Targeting Relevance Measuring and Reporting on Website Performance KPIs Driving Your SEO Content Strategy Measuring and Optimizing Toward Marketing Goals Why is Google Analytics So Important? Google Analytics is important because it provides website performance data that is not readily available on other platforms. These non-website platforms include key performance insights from channels like apps, social media channels, email marketing campaigns, and referring websites that drive traffic to your site. Without this data, business owners would have no insight into how their site is performing, where customers are coming from, or how they can improve their marketing strategies. If you’ve ever watched Shark Tank, you’ve probably seen an entrepreneur get bit by at least one shark on the panel for not being prepared with key data about their business. Why is this? Because without the kind of data-driven insights Google Analytics provides, they would be wasting valuable time and money by investing in that business. Let’s say you build a website to sell the best cupcakes in your geographic region. Imagine how much more effective your marketing and advertising budget would be if armed with the following insights: The typical searches someone initiates before coming to your site so you can craft the best content strategy to support organic SEO The most popular times of day, devices used, and demographics of your visitors and consumers Identifying interests and behaviors like people who are vegan or gluten-free, so you don’t waste valuable marketing budget targeting irrelevant audiences Tracking a consumer’s path through your buying funnel to create the most seamless experience on their journey through your website or landing page What is Google Analytics Used For? Google Analytics is used to track and report on website data that allows business owners to make data-informed decisions around their digital marketing strategies. Identifying these KPIs and their associated trends will help drive more awareness, traffic, and ultimately revenue, so Google Analytics’ significance cannot be understated. Analytics Helps You Understand Your Audience Too many businesses use the ‘spray and pray’ approach. They see the digital landscape as a great way to let everyone know about their business, and hope that it hits the bullseye somewhere along the way. But keep in mind that whether you are paying for PPC advertising or not, there are valuable financial and human resources going toward your other digital marketing efforts like SEO and CRO. Let’s go back to our cupcake example, because who doesn’t love a good cupcake? Well, actually…a lot of people. And that’s the point. Knowing your audience KPIs and tracking their responsiveness to your campaigns, their behaviors as they traffic your site, and even their demographics and devices, will help guide your valuable resources to target those most likely to be seeking your goods and services. Below is a brief snapshot of what Google Analytics (more importantly, GA4) provides you under the Demographic Overview section of the standard User Reporting. Knowing these insights can help guide you in everything from creative asset and messaging development, to geographic and special interest audience targeting. And that’s just scratching the surface! screenshot of sample GA4 demographic overview Measuring and Reporting on Website Performance Let’s talk about website performance and how Google Analytics can improve the user experience, leading to increased leads and sales. Many businesses do user testing before launching a product or service, to make sure that they are giving their potential consumer the most seamless experience possible not only in the consideration phase, but throughout the buying journey. So back to the cupcake: if you performed user testing that told you a particular ingredient detracted from your potential consumers’ experience, wouldn’t you seek to correct it? By not looking at Google Analytics to track website performance trends, you may be leaving site visitors with an unsavory experience, and not arming yourself with the information with which to improve it. This is where your competition can pull ahead. This is why Google Analytics is an important part of our Conversion Rate Optimization Services offering. By understanding conversion rates and engagement rates on key pages, identifying medium performance (whether and how many website visitors came from paid, organic, direct, or referral traffic), and the journey users are taking, you can create a frictionless experience to guide users to that final conversion action. For example, in the Acquisition Overview in GA4 you can quickly identify patterns in traffic sources and the sessions that those sources led to. screenshot of sample GA4 acquisition overview Another benefit of Google Analytics is that it can be easily connected to Google Data Studio (GDS, now known as Looker Studio) to facilitate accessible dashboards allowing business owners to easily identify insights to drive website optimizations. Analytics Helps Direct Content and SEO Strategy What if your C-level executives have big goals around lifting those organic search results listed above: how might Google Analytics help you drive improvement in your SEO strategy? Google Analytics is a great way to identify both what is working and what isn’t working. One method is to look at which landing pages or blog pages are doing best. A few ideas from the GA4 screenshot below: What gets the most views per user? What drives the longest engagement time? What pages are delivering conversions? Aligning this with some QoQ or YoY comparisons may help you identify older content that warrants a refresh. From there, taking a look at what content marketing platforms have been serving you best will guide the content distribution strategy you use to elevate that newly refreshed content. It could be via email marketing campaigns, social media, or paid media support. This is just one demonstration of how to use data for organic content strategy. screenshot of sample GA4 page analysis Google Analytics Helps Ensure You Are Hitting Your Marketing Goals While the above sections have focused on some critical performance optimization strategies… Understanding your audience to create more effective targeting Identifying trends and behaviors in website performance to guide your conversion rate optimization and improve user journeys Measuring engagement and trend behaviors to help inform and advance your SEO strategy A key theme that underlies it all is the fact that tracking and monitoring your Google Analytics data helps keep a consistent pulse on critical KPIs so there are no surprises about what targets are being hit at the end of each quarter or ahead of a new budget period. You will always have a story to tell about goal achievement, and what can be done next to improve performance. And that’s the icing on that analytical cupcake. Knowing all that, you certainly wouldn’t want to lose access to these critical insights, right? Of course not, that is why the time is NOW to transition your Universal Google Analytics account to the new GA4 platform before Universal Analytics sunsets at the end of June, 2023.

Sales Marketing,"MailChimp Review (2024): Mail For the Masses? Last updated: May 7, 2024 See Updates This article has been written and researched by our expert tooltesters through a precise methodology. Learn more about our methodology Robert Brandl	Robert Brandl Author Inka Wibowo	Inka Wibowo Researcher EmailTooltester is supported by readers like yourself. We may earn a commission when you purchase through our links. Of course, this won't increase the cost for you. MailChimp is often the first email newsletter tool that springs to mind, possibly because of their marketing and charming monkey-fied aesthetic. Which might explain why they have over 14,000 people signing up to their platform every day! At Tooltester, we use Mailchimp for one of our projects - mainly because the referral credits we've racked up through the years makes it essentially free for us to use. However, while I was initially a very enthusiastic MailChimp user, the once simple-to-use software has evolved into a relatively complicated construct of bundled-together features. And if I had to pay to use it, I'm not sure I would. In fact, for our business's other projects, I prefer using other email marketing services like Brevo and MailerLite. Now, my goal is not to discourage you: depending on your priorities, Mailchimp can still be a good option. So, let's explore where they shine: Where MailChimp stands out Mailchimp offer a free plan, which gives you access to most of the available tools, including their built-in survey maker and landing page builder. This is particularly good news for personal and small business users. The downside is that the subscriber and sending allowance have gone down significantly recently, but more on that below. If you’re an SMB looking for an all-in-one solution, then this could be just what you need. They also have pay-as-you-go options, which work out to be cheaper for low-volume clients, whilst also giving you some included extras such as automation and integration options. best esp comparison template But where is MailChimp heading in the future? A recent development is that MailChimp has been bought for the sum of $12 billion in cash and stocks by financial software company Intuit. We looked into this company's history and saw that it has spent millions of dollars lobbying to make sure that solutions for free and easy tax filing in the US are not made a reality. This new acquirement has already affected the price plans. Mailchimp used to offer a much more generous free plan. Now users are limited to a maximum of 500 contacts, whereas previously it was 2000. Automations are also no longer available on the free plan. We wonder whether this will continue to affect MailChimp's operations, pricing, and overall ESP product in the near future.

Thorough reporting Basically everything you need to know, including clients, geo-tracking, social media and Google Analytics integration. Endless Integration Options Mailchimp offers over 500 integrations and add-ons. Therefore you can easily incorporate any marketing tools that you are already using and discover new tools for your business. Extra features Mailchimp continue to expand their feature set, the most recent additions being appointment scheduling software and the online store builder (the latter is currently only available in beta in the US and UK). And more recently, their GPT-powered AI email creator. Is MailChimp the right newsletter service for you? Recommended if: Not recommended if: Integrations are important to you If you run an ecommerce store, blog, nonprofit, small business, or restaurant, and need your newsletter tool to integrate with other software, Mailchimp is a good option. It offers hundreds of integrations to both popular and niche applications (such as Zapier, Shopify, WordPress, and OpenTable). You need an all-in-one solution for inbound campaigns and a CRM MailChimp have always emphasized the importance of running opt-in based lead capture campaigns. They make it easy to do so with features such as forms, landing pages and automated drip campaigns. With the introduction of their in-built CRM, you can now set up customer profiles and assign customers a lifetime value (Standard plan and upwards). You offer online or in-person services Mailchimp’s new appointment booking feature means that you can add a service listing page with your availability to your website. You can even take online payments. You want native commerce features in your email marketing tool There’s an advantage to having everything you need in one tool. Those who want to manage their email marketing and sell products online all under one roof will be interested to hear that this is possible with Mailchimp. Rating Details Ease of Use It has a clean interface, and the tools are easy to use. However, the navigation could be clearer, as certain tools are slightly hidden. Setting up the initial opt-in process can be somewhat challenging as the menus are a little confusing. Editor I	There are two editors available. Both are fast and simple to use and have all the main content blocks (video, columns, social buttons, etc.). Personalization I	If/then/else logic isn’t very user-friendly, but available. MailChimp at least offer a handy cheat sheet to help you grasp the concepts. Merge tags can be inserted in the email content to add the readers name or email address. Email types I	Classic newsletters, autoresponders, A/B testing, RSS and transactional emails. You can also send postcards, a feature unique to Mailchimp. Choice and Flexibility of Template Designs I	Lots of choice, relatively modern looking too. All the drag & drop templates are responsive, but the classic templates are not. Bear in mind that the free plan only comes with the basic email templates, which look a bit outdated. Email Marketing Automation I	This is relatively robust, with rules to send follow-up emails based on certain conditions, such as clicks, opens, etc. More complicated automations related to goals/email link actions are also available, via the Customer Journeys feature, which allows workflow-based marketing automation. Note: automations aren’t available on the Free plan. List Management I	Mailchimp offer pretty good segmentation methods, allowing you to combine up to five positive or negative conditional relationships (e.g. what email client they use, whether they’ve opened a particular campaign). Management across lists is not possible as each list is siloed. Registration Forms/ Opt-in & Opt-out- Process I	Simple drag & drop setup for forms, although a bit finicky to select color options, only allowing you to add the color code. You can add your own fields, and adding the form to your site is easy. They also offer pop-up registration forms to integrate with your website. Deliverability I	MailChimp’s deliverability rates are among the highest out of the providers we’ve tested. They also managed to decrease the amount of emails being delivered to Gmail Promotions tab, with more of their emails now landing in the Primary tab. Reports and Analysis Pretty much all you need regarding reporting is here. You have openers, Google Analytics integration (which allows for conversion tracking), as well as clients, geo-tracking, click mapping and social media. Languages I	The site itself is only available in English, with the help section being available in Spanish, French, German and Portuguese. The emails themselves can be auto-translated with Google Translate into many languages, but of course it would be better if the site itself was more internationally accessible. Spam- and Design-Testing I	Mailchimp use third-party run tool ‘Inbox Preview’ by Litmus. Monthly paid plans come with 25 tokens and allow you to see what designs will look like for different clients, and on different devices. No spam testing is available. If you need more tokens, you’ll need to purchase these through Litmus. Find out how to avoid spam filters here. Bounce Management I	Hard bounces are immediately removed, while soft bounces are re-sent for three days. These will eventually be considered hard bounces if it occurs over multiple campaigns. Blocklist I	You can upload a suppression list of the contacts you don’t want to send to. Storage available for data and images unlimited There seems to be no limit to the amount of files, just that they need to be under 10MB in size each. Authentication I	DKIM and SPF, SenderID and DomainKeys available. Own Domain I	Tracking links in your emails will use the domain “list-manage.com” Different levels of account access I	You have five different levels within Mailchimp: viewer, author, manager, admin & owner. Integrations There are over 800 integrations available for your account! From eCommerce, to social and website integrations, you’d be hard-pressed to find an area that’s not represented – they also recently reintroduced their integration with Shopify. Landing Page Builder I	It’s pretty hard to find the landing page editor, which is accessible through the campaigns section. There are 10 modern templates, and you can use your own domain name (e.g. www.your-biz.com). Also, there is no A/B testing feature. GetResponse offers a far superior alternative in terms of combined page-building and email marketing features. Customer Support They have a thorough, and easy-to-search, knowledge base. Where Mailchimp loses points, though, is the fact that this is the only help that’s available unless you upgrade your account to a paid one. The live chat option, on upgrade, was fine, but quite slow compared to other tools we tested. Overall rating 3.9 Very user-friendly and feature-rich; there’s a reason why this tool is so popular. They could be a little more internationally-friendly, though, and they are pretty expensive. Mailchimp Deliverability In previous years, we’ve been quite skeptical of Mailchimp’s email deliverability, especially considering they are one of the most popular email providers out there. However, they do seem to be improving their deliverability. In our most recent test, they were one of the providers with the high percentage of emails delivered to Gmails main inbox (rather than promotions or spam). Let’s see if they can keep up the the good work! Conclusion MailChimp is a decent enough tool for most English-speaking users, with its range of features, as well as their free and pay-as-you-go plans. Keep in mind, though, that their subscription plans are expensive compared to similar newsletter tools.

So let’s begin. email marketing software alternatives	Looking for an alternative? Save $$$ of your marketing budget by switching to Moosend today! Disclaimer: The information below is accurate as of May 2023. Mailchimp Overview & Ratings Here’s the overall rating of Mailchimp’s features and functionality: mailchimp review As of November 2021, Mailchimp has become part of Intuit, a company specializing in financial software. This has brought certain changes to the email marketing platform, namely the pricing changes and the free plan’s further limitations. Intuit Mailchimp came with new features and improvements that finally upgraded the tool and made it more competitive to a user base of marketers, advertisers, eCommerce store owners, Non-Profit organizations, IT, and SaaS. Nevertheless, after reviewing some of the best email marketing services, Mailchimp remains a platform with a steep pricing model and a peculiar email contact charging structure. Mailchimp Pros & Cons: Summary Below you can find a table showcasing Mailchimp’s strengths and weaknesses. Pros Cons Ease of use Affordability and pricing Email editor Email template library Marketing automation Signup forms Segmentation Landing pages Personalization Design & A/B Testing Analytics & reporting Customer support Email deliverability Integrations Now let’s see what led us to this categorization. Mailchimp Pros: Analyzed In this section, we’ll see the marketing features that performed well, starting with the overall usability of the tool. Ease Of Use The first point in our Mailchimp review is the software’s ease of use. At first glance, we noticed the clean user interface that allows users to find what they are looking for. You can find an overview of your campaigns and performance on the left side menu. Moreover, the creation process is pretty straightforward. You just need to click the “Create” button and select the campaign you want to craft. mailchimp dashboard Overall, Mailchimp has a clean and simple interface to find what you need. However, some features like the double opt-in and reCAPTCHA seem hidden. You can look at the help articles to find their exact location; otherwise, you need to search for them manually, which will take some time. Email Editor Before we analyze the builder, it’s important to know that Mailchimp offers two editors, the Classic and the New Builder. You can select your version in your profile settings under “Details.” mailchimp email builders In this Mailchimp review, we’ll examine the New Builder since it offers better functionality, including a redo/undo option. The new drag-and-drop editor is an improved version of the classic version. You will find various content blocks, layouts, and styles to create your email campaign, including images, videos, surveys, products, and apps. In terms of usability, we found the builder fast and easy to use, providing a seamless creative experience. You can add text to the design by clicking on the block and edit it through the ribbon on top. mailchimp new email builder Another plus of Mailchimp’s email builder is the integrated error-checking tool which helps you fix potential problems on the spot. A copy optimization option is also available in beta to help you enhance your headings and sentence structure. Lastly, this email marketing tool allowed us to generate text for headlines, paragraphs, subject lines, and more through the Generate tool on the left-side menu. Select your content type, and Mailchimp’s email editor will provide you with great suggestions to save time. Marketing Automation Tools In this section, we’ll see Mailchimp’s new automation feature called Customer Journeys to create automated sequences and follow-ups for your audience. Here, we got the option to start from scratch or choose one of the pre-built journeys to save time. Here, we selected the Recover abandoned carts pre-built sequence. mailchimp customer journey builder Overall, the workflow editor is user-friendly. You can customize the existing journeys or add new steps to the sequence by clicking the add button. Mailchimp offers a variety of rules and actions to make simple and complex sequences for your audience. If you start from scratch, you need to select the purpose of the new journey and then start building it from the ground up. While it may take some time to get used to the builder, we didn’t find any major issues here, and the customer journey map creation process was smooth. However, if you are a beginner, we’d advise using the pre-built sequences as a guide since automations can be tricky to work with without prior knowledge. Segmentation Mailchimp will enable you to group your audience based on different criteria, such as demographics, location, and more. To create a segment, we first need to add our subscribers. You can do that manually or import your email list from another service. Uploading and copy-pasting them is also an option if you have CSVs or spreadsheets. mailchimp contact import methods For this Mailchimp review, we added contacts through the last option. The process was fast and easy, and the tool showed us the columns we needed to review to ensure the data matched the corresponding fields. After we finalized the new contact list, we jumped to the segment builder to test how to group our new contacts. The process was easy, and Mailchimp’s builder gave us a lot of conditions to choose from to make our segments as specific as possible. mailchimp segment builder In a nutshell, Mailchimp will let you segment your audience based on tags and personal details, activity, and how they were acquired. Before we proceed, it’s worth mentioning that while the segmentation options are good, email list management is a bit lacking since you can’t manage across lists due to them being siloed. So to get the best results (and minimize frustrations), you have to create a single one. Personalization To create more targeted email marketing campaigns, you can use Mailchimp’s personalization feature. This is possible through merge tags, a tool that will let you insert dynamic content into your campaigns. mailchimp personalization merge tags You can find a selection of tags under the “Merge Tags” drop-down menu, including first name, last name, address, phone, etc. Moreover, you can create new ones and customize the existing merge tags to set default values. The option is in the Audience Tab, where you will find your contacts and segments. Overall, it’s fairly easy to set up your tags, even though you will need to familiarize yourself with some terminology before you start and double-check them as they are style sensitive. This means that a single formatting change will affect them (extra bolding, italics, etc.) and make them unusable. Analytics & Reporting Moving on to Mailchimp’s real-time analytics and reporting, the first thing that caught our attention was the new Audience analytics (beta), where you can monitor contact status and net subscriber growth. mailchimp audience analytics In the Reports section, you can check how your marketing campaigns perform, including important email metrics such as your opens, clicks, bounces, and unsubscribes. Overall, in this Mailchimp review, we found the campaign reports to be simple and informative, making them great for small businesses that want to track their performance. Here are the things that the feature will track for you: Link performance Predicted demographics 24-hour performance Subscribers with most opens Social performance Top locations by opens Apart from the standard reports, you can also get an in-depth email performance analysis through the Custom Reports tool. Note: After returning to our reports, we were informed that Mailchimp will remove the reports page. The platform then notified us that to access our report in the future we need to go to all campaigns. Email Deliverability In this section, we considered numerous reviews from existing Mailchimp users. Most seem satisfied with Mailchimp’s ability to land emails in their subscribers’ inboxes. However, numerous users claim that their email marketing campaigns end up in the spam folder. While email deliverability is good, there’s room for improvement here. Here is an overview of Mailchimp’s deliverability score based on yearly tests: mailchimp email deliverability score through the years Of course, the platform will ask you to verify your domain before you set up SPF and DKIM. We found the authentication option under the Website tab. The process is fast, and you can continue with your setup when you complete the verification process. mailchimp custom domains If you want to keep track of your campaigns, Mailchimp offers an Abuse Complaints metric in the Reporting tab to help you identify how many users flagged your message as spam. However, this doesn’t indicate the number of email marketing campaigns automatically ending up in the spam folder, so follow email deliverability best practices to keep your reputation intact and minimize this metric. Integrations Lastly, we found out that Mailchimp offers 300+ integrations to help us streamline our marketing, from eCommerce platforms like Shopify to CRM tools like Salesforce. mailchimp integrations The integrations are grouped into categories (eCommerce, analytics, social media) to explore them more easily. Here are some popular tools we found: Analytics: Google Analytics, Email Heatmaps, Firebase, Cyfe Contact management: Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zerobounce, Zoho CRM Payments: SamCart, MoonClerk, Humanitix eCommerce: Shopify, Big Cartel, BigCommerce Content: WordPress, Drupal, LearnWorlds Now that we analyzed Mailchimp’s strengths, it’s time to look at its weaknesses. Mailchimp Cons: Analyzed Below, you will find the features that impressed us the least and have room for improvement. Affordability & Pricing Structure In this Mailchip review, the biggest drawback we found is undoubtedly its pricing model. Small businesses will not find this option attractive since the paid plans will get steep quickly. To give you an idea, the Essentials and Standard plans begin at $13 and $20 for 500 contacts, but they will get up to $110 and $135 for 10K subscribers. Mailchimp pricing for 10K contacts There’s also a monthly email send limit, which is understandable, but what can discourage users is the way Mailchimp charges for contacts. While other email service providers only charge you for unique subscribers, Mailchimp will do so for duplicate, unsubscribed, and inactive ones. If you don’t pay attention to your email list, you will pay for the same contact twice or thrice. Affordability and Mailchimp’s peculiar way of counting subscribers are probably the platform’s greatest weaknesses, as it will not be a viable option for SMBs. We believe using the Standard plan will be a good solution if you don’t have complex needs and don’t need advanced segmentation tools (which are a must for eCommerce). Lastly, it’s good to know that Mailchimp will automatically bill you for overages, while if you need transactional emails (SMTP server), you need to buy additional credits to send them. *Mailchimp’s pricing increased once again as of November 2023 by an average of 7% for marketing plans, and this also affected the overage fees. So, users need to be extra careful with their limits and contact number. Email Template Library Mailchimp offers 100 pre-made templates to create your next email campaign. However, depending on the builder you choose, you’ll get different options. For example, only 30 designs appear in the library when you select the New Builder. Moreover, users are claiming that the classic templates aren’t responsive. mailchimp email template library While the pre-made templates are fully customizable and responsive, they seem repetitive and outdated. Moreover, if you don’t want to pay to get more through Mailchimp’s marketplace, you will need to create yours from scratch, which isn’t a time-saver here. What we liked, though, is that you can code your own template by importing HTML files, pasting in code, or importing a zip. Apart from that, Mailchimp’s template library will cover your basic needs and offer a quick design to send a simple message to your audience. Signup Forms The form builder was the most confusing of all the features. When you click on the signup forms tab, you’ll get the form builder option, which will give you the following: mailchimp form builder At first glance, this made us think that’s all Mailchimp’s builder is about, and we only found out about the actual pop-up builder when we clicked on the other available options. Here, things feel cluttered, and the options are just stacked under the Signup form URL option. Moreover, the most frustrating thing is that you need to add color backgrounds manually since there’s no color picker. The embedded form builder, though, is simple to use, following drag-and-drop logic and letting you create a pop-up in a few minutes. mailchimp embedded form builder Nevertheless, it’s too simple, and the options are not presented clearly, making you think you have fewer options than those available. Landing Pages In this Mailchimp review, we considered how easy it is to navigate the platform and how fast you can find the features. Finding Mailchimp’s Landing pages was tricky as we expected to find them in the Audience (along with the forms) or Website sections. To our surprise, Mailchimp’s Landing pages are in the campaign section, which someone can miss if they are in a hurry. Here, the platform offers ten pre-made landing page designs to work with. To proceed to have to choose one, as the start-from-scratch option is non-existent. mailchimp landing page builder Moreover, the builder follows the email editor’s drag-and-drop logic but the limited elements and the inability to add custom HTML are not ideal. A/B testing is also not possible, unlike other competitors offering the option. Overall, the difficulty in finding them, the simplicity, and the lack of modern templates and elements made us add them to the pros section. Design & Split Testing Regarding testing, Mailchimp will give you an Inbox Preview tool by Litmus to check how your campaign appears in different email clients. mailchimp testing tools As you can guess, this is a paid add-on where you need to give one token to create or update a preview, which isn’t great if you want to run multiple tests. In this case, Mailchimp suggests you signup for a Litmus account. Moreover, if you are on the free plan, you can’t use this service as it’s available only for Mailchimp’s paid subscribers. The lack of an Inbox Preview tool is a major drawback for a tool that will get quite expensive as you grow. Regarding the A/B Testing features, Mailchimp will let you test different variations of your email campaigns. Furthermore, for the Multivariate testing tool, though, you will need the Premium plan. Lastly, we noticed that we could only run split tests on emails but not on landing pages, which is another minus for the popular ESP. Customer Support When it comes to Mailchimp’s customer support, the tool has many helpful articles to help you find solutions to common problems. If you are a free user, you will definitely need to use the knowledge base and tutorials a lot because email support is only available for the first 30 days. When you upgrade, you can access 24/7 email and chat support, with a phone option only on the Premium plan. Assessing customer support is quite subjective here. Based on existing Mailchimp users’ experiences with it, we found that the major issue was the slow response time. After testing the customer support ourselves, we also came across longer-than-average chat waiting times. mailchimp customer support And while our problem wasn’t pressing, someone with an urgent issue who doesn’t have access to phone support will have to wait for a Mailchimp representative to get back to them. Mailchimp Pricing Plans Looking at Mailchimp’s pricing, you will find five plans offering you the digital marketing tools analyzed above. mailchimp pricing plans Before we get into specifics, the pricing model this ESP follows is contact-based. And based on the peculiar charging policy, you need to be careful with your email lists and duplicate contacts. Among the plans, there’s also a free version of the software. Let’s start with it. Free plan Mailchimp’s free plan has gone through changes, especially after Intuit’s acquisition of the company. This version of the software is for new marketers who want to test the tool and start growing their audience, having no complex needs or requirements. At the moment of writing this Mailchimp review, the free plan was for 500 contacts only and offered, among others, the following: 1,000 monthly emails Email support for 30 days 1 audience & marketing CRM Landing pages 1-step automations Note: marketing automation, A/B Testing, and email scheduling are unavailable in the free plan. Essentials – $13/month Moving on to the Essentials plan, this option will provide you with more tools and increased limits. However, it is still geared towards marketers who want to build their audience and have no complex needs. Here, users will have to pay $13/month for 500 contacts and 5,000 monthly emails. Among other things, the Essentials will: Remove Mailchimp’s branding Unlock A/B Testing and email scheduling Offer Automated customer journeys (no pre-built options) Give you behavioral targeting Overall, Essentials is quite restrictive, and users are recommended to get the Standard plan to unlock more capabilities. Note: You can try this plan for free for 1 month. Standard – $20/month With the Standard plan, users can access some of Mailchimp’s best features, including dynamic content, send-time optimization, and pre-built journeys. You will need to pay $20/month for 500 subscribers and 6,000 emails per month, which we didn’t find ideal. Apart from the features mentioned above, upgrading to this plan will give you access to: Custom-coded templates Predictive segmentation Campaign manager Content optimizer Mailchimp’s Standard plan is great for SMBs and startups. However, if you want the whole toolbox of marketing features, you will need to upgrade. Note: You can try this plan for free for 1 month. Premium – $350/month According to the description, this plan is best for teams and large businesses, and it includes Mailchimp’s most advanced tools, unlimited contacts, and phone priority support. This one has a slightly different pricing structure than the previous plans. More specifically, your email limit will increase to 150,000 sends monthly for up to 10K subscribers, and you will get access to all the features mentioned above, along with: Multivariate testing Comparative reporting Advanced segmentation Autoresponders Unlimited users (plus role-based access) Basically, if you want the full email marketing experience, you need to get the Premium plan. However, as we mentioned above, the steep pricing structure may not be ideal for smaller businesses. Custom Plans – Pay As You Go Apart from the core plans offered, you can also take Mailchimp’s personalized quiz to get a plan tailored to your business. If you aren’t a regular sender, you can use the pay-as-you-go option and buy enough credits to cover your email marketing needs. It’s worth noting that the Pay as You Go plan has the same features as the Essentials plan, with access to email themes and layouts, pre-made segments, and basic reports. You can find the credit option in your profile under Billing, and your credit options range between 5,00 to 25,000,0000. Mailchimp Alternatives As every tool has disadvantages, you need to be prepared for change, especially when your platform doesn’t work as promised or makes your tasks more tedious. To make an informed decision, our team has tested and compiled the best Mailchimp alternatives in the market. Below, you will find our top three options, favoring affordability, scalability, and ease of use: Moosend is an all-in-one email marketing and marketing automation solution with advanced features and affordable pricing. The email builder is user-friendly, while the automations are easy-to-implement even if you don’t have any technical expertise. Its winning point is the competitive pricing starting at $9/month and offering you all the needed features. Constant Contact is another option to consider if you want a less complex tool. The platform has, according to our Constant Contact review, a user-friendly editor, excellent email deliverability, and additional features, such as a new website builder they have recently launched. MailerLite is an affordable Mailchimp competitor that will help you create and automate your campaigns. The platform offers flexibility with a fast email editor, pre-made templates, easy-to-use automation, and more to get your email marketing strategy back on track. Compared to Mailchimp, this option has better deliverability rates based on multiple tests. Conclusion After taking an in-depth look at Mailchimp’s features, we can finally share our final thoughts. In terms of user experience, the platform will not disappoint you, although they can definitely improve the UI by “un-hiding” some of the core features, such as the landing pages. Moreover, Mailchimp is a great marketing tool to power up different aspects of your digital marketing strategy. The Customer Journeys tool is the most prominent feature, offering ease of use and multiple choices to set up the best sequences for your audience. Since the ESP didn’t have a visual editor before, this is a major upgrade, especially for new users. While Mailchimp has its advantages, there are numerous things that it could do better, namely, improve its email templates, enhance email deliverability, and make the signup forms and landing pages easier to find and use. Overall, it is a great option for larger businesses with the budget to fully leverage its advanced capabilities. However, that doesn’t mean that SMBs can’t benefit equally from it. Just read the pricing carefully and choose the plan that suits you the most. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Here you will find some common questions and answers regarding Mailchimp. 1.

Our Expert Opinion Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Show more Mailchimp at a Glance Mailchimp is an Atlanta-based email marketing and marketing automation platform. Since its launch in 2001, Mailchimp has become one of the most popular platforms for easily building automated email marketing campaigns and it is Forbes Advisor’s top-rated all-in-one email marketing platform. It offers a comprehensive and beginner-friendly email builder as well as a large number of features to help users more effectively communicate with their contacts and effectively convert leads into sales. Pros Mailchimp stands out for two main reasons―and two that do not often go together. First, it’s designed to be very modern and beginner-friendly. Its intuitive campaign builder and large library of prebuilt templates makes it fairly easy for just about anyone to use to create professional-quality email campaigns. Second, it has a very comprehensive set of features that make it a robust, all-in-one email marketing platform. Cons The downside of Mailchimp is that it is fairly limited when it comes to the number of emails users can send per month. Even with its top-tier plan, it has a maximum email send of 150,000 per month, which may not be worth the very expensive monthly fee of $1,325. Another drawback of Mailchimp is that it’s not known for offering top-notch support. Instead, users frequently note that support is slow to respond and lacks in terms of service quality. How Mailchimp Works Mailchimp has grown into an all-in-one email marketing and marketing automation platform that businesses can grow with. From the Mailchimp dashboard users have easy access to its email campaign builder, automation setup, audience creation and contact segment, performance insights and analytics and the ability to build landing pages and even a website. Since it offers all key components of running email marketing campaigns, from landing pages that trigger emails to behavioral targeting, it’s a full-service platform for those looking to leverage their online presence to land sales and build loyalty among existing customers. Mailchimp User Dashboard Mailchimp Core Features The core feature of Mailchimp is its Campaign Builder tool which is instrumental in the creation of professional business emails that don’t look like a standard text-based email from a friend or colleague. Every other feature it offers supports users in the ability to build and send email campaigns. For example, it has a quick contact import tool and contact generation tools to help users transfer and build their contact list. It has audience segmentation to help campaigns connect to their audience better and sign-up forms, landing pages and a website builder to integrate email triggers easily: Customized email design Campaign automations and journey creation Audience segmentation and behavioral targeting Signup forms, landing pages and websites What Sets Mailchimp Apart Mailchimp stands out for being an all-in-one email marketing machine where users can build their website, landing pages and popups that trigger automated email campaigns―complete with robust audience segmentation and analytics for performance insights and optimizations. This makes it a centralized platform for building, launching and analyzing marketing campaigns and a key tool in converting sales leads into customers.

Although limited, it does include up to 500 email sends per month and a contact list of up to 500 contacts consisting of one audience for one user. A limited number of email templates are available as well as all basic features. However, users cannot set up automations with the free plan and support is only available for the first 30 days via email. One other key difference is that the free plan also displays Mailchimp branding, so it may not be the best choice for professional use. Essentials Plan Those with more than 500 contacts will be required to upgrade to the Essentials plan, which includes up to three users and three audiences. Pricing varies depending on how many contacts you have. For example, the price for 500 contacts is $13 per month, 5,000 contacts is $75 per month and 25,000 contacts is $270 per month. Aside from contacts, this plan offers more features than the free plan, such as automations and full access to all of its email templates and A/B testing. However, it does not include some of the more advanced features such as send-time optimization, predictive segmentation or multivariate testing. Standard Plan The Standard plan is Mailchimp’s midtier plan that offers more advanced features than its Essentials plan, such as send-time optimization, predictive segmentation or multivariate testing as well as five users and five audiences. Pricing varies by the size of your contact list. For insight, it costs $20 per month for up to 500 contacts, $100 per month for 5,000 contacts and $310 per month for 25,000 contacts. Premium Plan The Premium plan is geared towards meeting the needs of larger businesses. This is because the primary difference between the Premium plan and Standard plan is that the Premium plan includes unlimited users and unlimited audiences. It also includes role-based permissions for users, giving businesses with large teams the flexibility to manage various aspects of their email marketing campaigns and the platforms they use to generate leads. The premium plan starts at $350 per month. However, similar to all other Mailchimp plans, pricing increases based on the number of contacts you have. Setup To sign up, simply go to Mailchimp and select the free plan or sign up for a free 30-day trial of a premium plan. To do so, you will be required to input your name and email address. Mailchimp will then send an email to you where you can then activate your new account. Upon activation, you will be prompted to input your address (which due to anti-spam laws, will be displayed at the bottom of your emails), your goals, how many email contacts you have and your web address which then imports your brand, such as business name, logo, color scheme and fonts. Once you have created your new account, the process of adding your existing contacts is simple. Navigate to the left-hand vertical menu and select “Audience.” Next, click the button to “Add your contacts” and select which method you would like to use: import from another service, upload a file (CSV or TXT) or copy and paste. For those that do not yet have contacts, you can create a signup form, a social post or a social media ad through the Mailchimp interface. Mailchimp Import Contacts Emails can be created using the Campaign Builder using one of the many prebuilt templates or from scratch. The Campaign Builder is a simple, drag-and-drop editor, making the process of designing a professional email straightforward. For those that are looking to set up automations so that emails automatically send based on set triggers, such as subscribing via your website or making a purchase, there are prebuilt journeys created to make automation configuration simple―even for nontechnical users. Mailchimp Pre Built Template Library Ease Of Use Mailchimp is a user-friendly platform that was built to help those with zero technical abilities create, deploy and manage professional email marketing campaigns. The interface generally does a good job of walking users through the process and it offers users the option to use prebuilt templates for emails, landing pages and web pages. While it’s widely considered easy to use, it does involve a learning curve. As intuitive and streamlined as it is, there are many moving parts when it comes to email marketing. For example, there are contact lists and customer segmentation, email design, creating customer journeys and setting up deployment with automations and triggering emails to send based on actions that occur on your website, such as a newsletter signup or online purchase. Mailchimp Email Campaign Builder Interface Mailchimp Email Campaign Set Up Security Mailchimp has robust security measures built-in to help safeguard data. While it does not disclose all security measures (as another security measure), it does share that its data centers manage 24/7 security complete with biometric scanners and that it has distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) migration at all of its data centers. Additionally, it has numerous internal security measures in place and it is International Organization for Standardization 27001 (ISO 27001) certified. With its array of protections, users can feel confident that data is safe and protected against losses and corruption. Mailchimp Customer Service & Support Support channels vary by plan, giving different users different experiences and support quality. For example, the free plan comes with email support, but only for the first 30 days. After that, users on the free plan will not have access to support unless they upgrade to a paid plan. The entry-level Essentials plan and the midtier Standard plan both include 24/7 support via email and chat. Those with the top-tier Premium plan get access to priority phone support in addition to email and chat support. In our experience, support via email was not responsive. Over three days after sending an inquiry, there was still no response from Mailchimp support. While I reached out with a basic question, the support quality with the free plan is not only limited to your first 30 days but also not particularly helpful. Mailchimp Email Support Mailchimp Additional Features Worth Noting There are a large number of additional Mailchimp features beyond its core feature set. For example, users can organize audiences and add custom tags for easy contact management, build out social media posts and ads, customize the unsubscribe page, create custom reports, easily design branded content with the Creative Assistant tool and build surveys. What is unique about the survey builder is that there are prebuilt surveys that are easy to customize and can use a 1-10 scale or emojis which is a fun way to get feedback quickly from customers and contacts. In return, this can increase the response rate of surveys. Mailchimp Survey Builder The Fine Print Its free plan is very limited―not only in terms of email sends but in features. Users on the free plan will quickly find that there are a number of features they do not have access to. For example, users on the free plan cannot set up automations and use certain templates. Another thing to note is that Mailchimp is notorious for frequent updates that often involve the further elimination of features for users on the free plan. Mailchimp Alternatives and How They Compare Mailchimp	Zoho Campaigns	Brevo	Moosend Rating	Starting Price (500 Contacts)	Free; $13 per month	Free (up to 2,000 contacts); $3 per month	Free; $25 per month (unlimited contacts)	$7 per month (billed annually) Starting Price (5,000 Contacts)	$69 per month	$23.25 per month	$25 per month (unlimited contacts)	$38 per month Free Trial Length	30 days	14 days	Not available	30 days Drag and Drop Email Builder	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes Email Templates	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes Contact Management	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes Audience Segmentation	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes Automations	Yes	Yes	Yes, although limited to 2,000 contacts on the Free and Starter plan	Yes Signup Form Builder	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes Landing Page Builder	Yes	Yes	Available with Business and Enterprise plans	Yes Website Builder	Yes	Available via Zoho One	No	No Learn More --	--	On Brevo's Website	-- Mailchimp vs Zoho Campaigns Zoho Campaigns is a very comparable email marketing platform to Mailchimp with a nearly identical feature set. Both offer a clean and modern user experience with a large number of email-related features, such as advanced audience segmentation, send-time optimization and lead generation tools such as a signup form builder and landing page builder. However, Zoho Campaigns is more affordable than Mailchimp. Zoho Campaigns’ free plan includes up to 2,000 contacts while Mailchimp’s is limited to 500. Another difference is that Zoho Campaigns has a Pay as You Go plan for users that use email marketing campaigns sporadically and thus do not want to pay a monthly subscription fee for a product they don’t use monthly. Mailchimp vs. Brevo Mailchimp and Brevo differ greatly in terms of what their free plans offer users. Brevo is unique in that its free plan includes unlimited contacts, whereas Mailchimp’s plan has a maximum of 500 contacts. However, despite Brevo’s unlimited contacts, it is worth noting that it has a daily email send limit of 300. Brevo also limits access to automations and its landing page builder to its mid and top-tier plans. While Mailchimp’s pricing is based on the number of contacts users have its far more straightforward than Brevo’s pricing, which involves a flat-rate monthly subscription fee, plus another monthly fee based on the number of emails users send per month, such as 20,000 emails per month costs an extra $16 per month, and there is a $12 monthly fee to remove the Brevo logo from emails. In total, Brevo’s starting price for a plan that does not display its branding is $37 per month. That said, Brevo appears to be more affordable than Mailchimp at first glance but, depending on the features you need, the number of contacts you have and the number of emails you plan to send per month, Mailchimp may be the more budget-friendly option. Mailchimp vs Moosend When comparing Mailchimp to Moosend, it’s key to consider the number of contacts you have or plan to have as Mailchimp is more affordable for those with fewer than 500 contacts and Moosend is more affordable for those with more than 500 contacts. Both are generally considered to be very user-friendly, however, Moosend’s templates include dummy content which can be helpful for beginners who need assistance with visualizing what their email will look like. Another difference is that while Mailchimp has more lead generation tools to help users build out contact lists, Moosend has more advanced tracking features. These are particularly helpful for data-driven businesses that will use the insights to optimize their email campaigns. Who is Mailchimp Best For? Mailchimp is one of the best all-in-one email marketing platforms on the market. Its wide feature set means that users have a centralized platform for building contact lists, sending automated emails and optimizing campaigns. Users can design emails from within the user dashboard, eliminating the need for third-party graphic design tools or skills. Although it can be used for basic email marketing, it has advanced features that make it a good choice for those who plan to make email marketing part of their core marketing strategy and who want a platform that can grow with them. Our Expert Opinion Based on our first-hand experience using Mailchimp, it’s a quality email marketing platform that generally is easy to use. As with anything, it does involve a bit of a learning curve, but it tends to be pretty intuitive. Its template library can feel a bit sparse as it offers little by way of various styles and designs and, instead, templates center on choosing different layouts. For highly visual users who prefer more design inspiration, this can feel lackluster.",MailChimp
Sales Marketing,"Mailchimp - use cases and best practices Find out how to make the most of Email or Shareable link surveys sent via Mailchimp and the Mailchimp integration Agnieszka avatar Written by Agnieszka Updated over a week ago What is Mailchimp? Mailchimp is a popular tool we integrate with, which makes it very easy to send out surveys and keep track of the respondents' answers. Suppose you use a mailing list in Mailchimp to distribute your surveys. Remember to select Mailchimp as this survey's email software: In that case, we automatically capture subscribers' first name, last name, and email address information - so you'll know who responded to your survey! You can filter survey results by these attributes, enable our native integration to send the responses to users' Mailchimp profiles, and use them to plan future campaigns. Why is it a good idea to use Survicate alongside Mailchimp? Our tool automatically calculates and shows summarized results from a survey and allows you to see each individual's submission in one place. How to get started? Sending surveys via MailChimp and syncing answers to the respondents' profiles is very and quick easy to set up! Here you can see how to create and send Email surveys via Mailchimp and what the native Survicate - MailChimp integration can do here. Whereas in this article, you'll find ideas for how to use our native Mailchimp integration and how to learn the most about your respondents with Email or Shareable link surveys sent via this tool. Use case examples While creating your survey, you can start with one of our ready-to-use templates or add questions from scratch. Both ways, you can create a survey that will fit your needs. Below, we listed our customers' most popular use cases. 1. Add a survey to your Mailchimp newsletter By including a survey in your Mailchimp newsletter campaigns, you can better track client satisfaction levels and address any feedback from customers. You can add follow-up questions to those who rated the newsletter badly to ask them for tips on what to improve. Here's an example template for a newsletter survey, ready to use! 2. Automate an Email survey to be sent out after a customer's first purchase A survey you send in a Mailchimp email after purchase can inquire about product quality, shipping, or customer support. The answers will help you identify areas for improvement and increase customer satisfaction. Mailchimp describes how to automate an email to be sent after a person's first purchase here. We'll show you how to build a survey to include in such automation that will ask about all the important aspects of the customer's experience. You can use our Post-purchase survey template or create your own survey from scratch! If you'd like to send a link to the survey in your Mailchimp email, using a matrix question is a great way for a respondent to rate multiple parts of the purchasing process: However, if you'd rather embed the survey in the email, starting with an NPS®, a Rating or Smiley scale, or a Single-choice question is better. 3. Personalise the survey and boost the response rate by recalling respondent attributes Include the respondent's name in the survey for a personalized touch or some other fact you know about them without creating a separate survey for each respondent! You can add respondents' attributes (an identifying trait) to the email's name or body and to the survey's URL.

Including their name in the survey makes them feel seen, without too much additional work on your side! To see all attributes that may be useful in your survey, take a look at Mailchimp's merge tag cheat sheet. 4. Update respondent profiles in Mailchimp and schedule follow-up communication with unhappy customers Following up with unhappy customers can help you reduce churn, learn about the pain points, and form long-lasting relationships. Create a survey and tag the MailChimp profiles of your respondents: Assigning different tags based on someone's answer lets you differentiate between happy and unhappy contacts and, later on, only send follow-up messages to unsatisfied customers. Create a new Email or Shareable link survey to send to previously tagged customers via Automation: 3. The follow-up survey can be a short questionnaire with a Text-answer question asking for more feedback from unhappy customers. It's best to send it out soon after the original survey for at least two reasons: the respondents will still remember why they left a low score; you'll be able to act on their feedback quickly to improve the experience for future customers. 📚 See more ways of acting on negative feedback in our guide. 5. Automate quarterly NPS surveys with Mailchimp Use the Mailchimp Automations option to configure an automatic distribution of your NPS surveys at defined time intervals. It can be handy to track how the NPS changes over time and if it's time to make changes to your service or product. You can use our ready Net Promoter Score survey template.

Copy the HTML code if you'd like to embed the survey's first question in the Mailchimp email. If you'd rather include the link to the survey in the email or behind a CTA button, copy the survey's link. In Mailchimp, head over to Automations > All journeys > Build from scratch and create a path that will send an email with a survey to an Audience, wait a certain period of time, then send the survey again, and so on. Feel free to create an Automation most suitable for your use case. 6. Send out a survey to measure satisfaction after an event Use a Survicate survey to measure attendee satisfaction after a conference or an event of any type.

Sales Marketing,"7 Reasons To Consider the Mailchimp CRM For Your Business Customer Relationship Management may not come to mind when you see the Mailchimp monkey logo. But maybe it should. Catch the scoop on Mailchimp's CRM platform. By Octavia Drexler Edited by Natalie Stenge Updated December 24, 2023. 7 Reasons To Consider the Mailchimp CRM For Your Business main image Imagine going into your favorite neighborhood store, where everyone knows your name and your order, only to find the nice people behind the counter have completely forgotten who you are. It stings, right? It also makes you not want to go back! That's similar to what happens when you don't have a customer relationship management (CRM) software to help you keep track of your customers. No matter what business you run or what size it may be, a CRM tool helps you stay on top of your customer data, contributing to email marketing that works, a sales process that feels truly personal, and support that connects with your customers. And if you're in the market for an affordable, efficient, and perfectly integrated CRM, Mailchimp's set of tools might be just what you need. Keep reading to see why. What is a CRM software? A CRM software is a tool that helps your business manage your relationships with your customers. Teams use CRMs to track interactions, data, and notes about current customers or potential ones. By serving as a comprehensive database, customer relationship management software stores vital customer information such as contact details, communication history, purchase behavior, and preferences. This centralized hub facilitates better understanding and customer engagement, resulting in improved customer loyalty and business growth. What does a CRM tool do? A CRM tool helps you collect, store, and organize customer data but also automates tasks like lead tracking, task assignments, and appointment scheduling. Most CRMs come with automation features, which foster consistency and save valuable time for sales and customer service teams. Also, the abundance of data stored in a CRM helps teams make better decisions and uncover improvement opportunities in pretty much every department – from how marketers reach their target audience, to how sales teams move through their sales process. Finally, the built-in analytics and reporting capabilities CRMs have help managers get an overview of customer actions and trends to gain crucial insights into customer behavior. crm-history-and-evolution Is Mailchimp a CRM? Mailchimp is largely known as an email tool, but it can go beyond sending email marketing campaigns to working as a decent CRM. Mailchimp integrates the necessary features specific to CRMs, like Contact management Audience segmentation Personalized communication In bringing these features together, Mailchimp bridges the gap between email marketing automation and CRMs, allowing businesses to manage customer relationships more effectively within a single platform. Types of sales CRMs There are three main types of sales CRMs, each catering to different aspects of customer engagement: Collaborative CRM This type of CRM promotes interdepartmental collaboration by enabling teams to share customer insights and notes. Businesses can enhance the customer experience across various touchpoints by fostering seamless communication. Operational CRM Operational CRMs excel in automating routine tasks such as order processing, lead management, and customer support. This automation optimizes workflows and ensures consistent and efficient operations. Analytical CRM Analytical CRMs leverage data analysis to extract meaningful insights from customer information. By identifying patterns and trends, businesses can make informed decisions, refine marketing strategies, and tailor offerings to meet customer demands. three-crm-software-types Why are CRMs important for marketers? Although they are mostly seen as sales tools, CRMs play a pivotal role in marketing because the data collected and stored in them helps marketers with behavioral targeting. CRM data helps marketers segment their audience and build personalized email campaigns that resonate. Additionally, CRMs enable marketers to track marketing campaign performance, analyze engagement metrics, and adjust strategies accordingly. This data-driven approach leads to higher engagement, conversions, and, ultimately, better ROI. Pro tip: make sure all of your communication is GDPR-compliant. Check out our guide to Mailchimp's GDPR features. Advantages of CRM for SMB marketers A lot of small and medium-sized (SMB) marketers think CRMs are only useful for large businesses. That's not true, though. SMB marketers can reap a lot of benefits from CRMs, too: Deep customer insight A CRM provides a unified platform to collect and manage customer data, facilitating deeper insights into customer behaviors and preferences. Better campaign segmentation With audience segmentation capabilities, SMB marketers can tailor messages to specific chunks of their mailing list, resulting in more relevant and impactful campaigns. campaign-segmentation-best-practices Improved tracking and reporting CRMs offer real-time tracking and reporting, allowing SMB marketers to fine-tune strategies based on actual performance data, rather than outdated information and hunches. Small and medium-sized businesses frequently avoid investing in tools like CRMs because they don't think they're big enough for such solutions. However, this attitude often backfires because, without a CRM, they miss out on the many benefits of using one – this actually hinders their growth. Advantages of CRM for sales teams Sales teams benefit significantly from the adoption of CRMs: Better time management ""Time is money"" might sound like an old cliche, but it's certainly true. Using a CRM eliminates manual work and significantly improves time management. More specifically, CRMs automate routine tasks like data entry, follow-ups, and lead assignments, allowing sales teams to focus on high-value interactions, healthy sales pipelines, and closing deals. Improved customer relationships Every salesperson knows nothing sells better and more recurrently than good relationships. Access to detailed customer profiles enables sales teams to personalize their approach, building trust and rapport with potential and existing customers, making them more likely to convert or become loyal customers. crm-effects-on-sales Enhanced sales processes Chaos is never a good business partner, but sales teams can feel it more stringently than anyone. With tight deadlines and high bars to clear, any kind of disorganization can prove costly. CRMs provide a streamlined platform to organize prospects and track progress, ensuring nothing slips through the cracks. This organization facilitates better sales processes, improving conversion rates. Boosted efficiency No tool can guarantee success, but using a powerful CRM can bring sales teams one step closer. Automation and data-driven insights help teams close more deals in less time by eliminating redundant efforts. This increases efficiency and productivity. Comprehensive reporting Data makes the world go round, and sales teams are no exception. A CRM collects valuable data that teams can use to generate detailed reports on sales performance, helping businesses identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. Cost savings No business has ever said ""no"" to saving a good buck. By automating manual tasks, CRMs contribute to cost savings by optimizing resource allocation and reducing operational overheads. Personalization The more you understand your Ideal Customer Persona and existing customers, the more you can tailor your solutions, connect more with your leads, and create customer-centric offers that turn into sales. CRMs provide an easy way to segment your leads and customize your messaging for each. positive-campaign-personalization-effects Increased sales The combined effect of the aforementioned advantages translates to increased sales through better customer relationships and streamlined processes. Advantages of CRM for business operations CRMs offer broader advantages that extend beyond customer interactions and can benefit the business as a whole: Improved communications CRMs break down communication silos by enabling teams to access up-to-date customer information, resulting in better internal collaboration and customer service. More than anything, a solid CRM database helps your teams relate to the same source of truth, which improves inter-departmental relations and helps everyone be more efficient. Automated data collection Your business needs data like human bodies need water: without it, you'll dry up in a desert of hunches, presumptions, and fuzzy numbers. CRMs automate the data collection process, enabling businesses to make informed decisions based on real-time customer insights and performance metrics. CRM software will also take manual data collection and management out of your team's hands. This improves their efficiency and reduces the probability of human error. To err is human, but there are tools to help you minimize that. Enhanced workflow automation CRMs don't just collect data – they also help manage it better. By automating workflows like lead assignment, task distribution, and report generation, your teams can focus on what really CRMs automate data entry and updates, ensuring accuracy and saving time, which would otherwise be spent on manual data management. Customer journey monitoring It takes an average of eight touchpoints to make a sale. You won't be able to know, with absolute certainty, how your customers interact with your business, and what kind of journey they take before converting. Still, CRM data can support your buyer journey mapping process and learn more about: Where your customers come from, What makes them tick (and click), And what tipped them over the edge into buying your product. CRMs provide a comprehensive view of the customer journey, allowing marketers to track real-time interactions and make necessary adjustments to increase ROI. Scalability Innovation is great, but it's useless without scalability. As an SMB grows into a bigger business, its operations become more complicated and time-consuming. An effective CRM system is designed to scale with the business, ensuring that processes remain organized and efficient as the company expands. How to choose a CRM as an SMB The market isn't short of CRM solutions for every business size and pocket. That doesn't mean all Customer Relationship Management tools on the market are worth your time. Some may just not be a good fit, and that's perfectly fine You need to know how to sift through the ocean of options to narrow it all down to a handful of CRMs likely to fit your business. Selecting the right CRM for an SMB involves strategic considerations, such as: Ease of use An intuitive interface is crucial for swift adoption, especially for SMBs without dedicated IT resources. Your team's already busy, likely juggling with more than they can even handle – adding yet another brand new tool to learn how to use can be burdensome. Make sure the CRM you pick is as easy to use as possible. The more intuitive it is, the quicker your team will learn how to use it, and the more time it will free up for other tasks. Comprehensive feature set The features you need in a CRM depend on your business needs, but comprehensive feature sets are key when it comes to SMBs. You may not need all the features offered by all the tools on the market. Still, you should list those you want and ensure your chosen tool can provide them to you. Analytics and reporting Advanced analytics capabilities empower SMBs with insights into customer behaviors, marketing campaign effectiveness, and trends, enabling data-driven decision-making. Adding data into tables is nice and it can help you keep things in order – but it's analytics and reporting where the true power of a CRM shines through. Integrations A good CRM should have seamless integrations with existing software and tools, to enhance operational efficiency and minimize disruptions. Direct integrations save you time and help you stay on top of all your customer data without manual transfers from one tool to another. Audience management tools Effective list segmentation and targeting functionalities enable SMBs to deliver tailored messages and campaigns that resonate with their customers. crm-ideal-qualities How can Mailchimp help marketers’ CRM needs?

Sales Marketing,"The Cons Of Mailchimp No One Tells You About Janani March 17, 2023 Email Book a Meeting cons of Mailchimp Mailchimp is a popular email marketing platform that has gained a significant following among businesses and marketers. Its range of features has become a go-to tool for creating and managing email campaigns. However, like any tool, Mailchimp has limitations and drawbacks that are often overlooked or not discussed enough. In this blog post, we will explore the cons of Mailchimp that are not commonly discussed and provide insights to help you decide whether Mailchimp is the right tool for your email marketing needs or to consider other Mailchimp alternatives in the market. So, let’s dive in and explore the cons of Mailchimp that no one tells you about! The Cons of Mailchimp You Need To Consider Before Using The Service! 1. No autonomy over the design of email Mailchimp is the email marketing tool of choice for over a million users worldwide. However, one of the drawbacks of Mailchimp is that it doesn’t offer much flexibility in design or templates. While you can customize their templates, there isn’t much room for creativity. However, with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, you can create your custom-made template and import it into Mailchimp for future email marketing campaigns. So if you want to make an email that stands out and looks different than everyone else’s, Mailchimp might not suit you. 2. Customer service could be better While Mailchimp provides various resources such as documentation and video tutorials to assist users, their customer support can sometimes be slow to respond and may not always provide the level of support users need. It’s worth noting that Mailchimp offers different customer support levels depending on your chosen plan. However, Mailchimp’s customer service is only available via email or chat; no phone support is available. This can be frustrating for users who need immediate assistance or have complex issues that may be difficult to communicate through email or chat. Customer service could be better Source: apps.shopify.com 3. User experience can be improved to make workflow more accessible and faster The bad user experience of Mailchimp is another drawback of the service. The users have to do a lot of clicks to reach the goal, open new windows, and scroll from one page to another. It takes time to get things done in Mailchimp. The user interface is not user-friendly and requires much effort for a new user to get familiar with it. So, Mailchimp users have grown tired of Mailchimp’s lackluster and unappealing user experience. It is especially problematic for novice users who might not be familiar with the basic concepts that Mailchimp uses. Some users have reported difficulty navigating the platform and complaints about slow loading times and a cluttered interface. User experience can be improved Source: G2 4. Possibly a bit better contact organization The other main drawback of Mailchimp is its organization of contacts. Mailchimp doesn’t allow you to organize your contacts in any way except by category or tags. You can’t sort by last name, first name, etc. If your contacts come from different sources (like your website, social media, and newsletter signups), you may end up with a mishmash of very similar names that are difficult to keep track of. The only way to solve this problem is to manually sort through your contacts list. 5. More free templates to choose from would be great Mailchimp lacks some basic email templates that other competitors provide. This is not a problem for professional marketers but can annoy new users. The lack of simple email templates makes it difficult for new users to create emails quickly and easily. It forces them to use third-party tools or basic text editors to create an email template, which is time-consuming and frustrating. Also, their templates are not very appealing, and options are pretty limited. Moreover, it’s not easy to find free email templates that you can use for all of your emails in Mailchimp. You can only find some free templates that you can use for newsletters, but if you want something more personalized, you will have to pay for it. More-free-templates Source: G2 6. Inability to do much with the Mailchimp smartphone application Another prominent drawback of Mailchimp is its inability to do much with the smartphone application. One cannot create and edit campaigns from the Mailchimp mobile app but must use the Mailchimp web interface instead. And the Mailchimp app is not very useful for someone who wants to do more than check their campaign statistics. For example, you cannot send out an email campaign through the Mailchimp app or create an A/B split test with their app. Inability to do much with the Mailchimp smartphone app Source: apps.shopify.com 7. Mailchimp emails going to spam One of the most common issues Mailchimp users face is their emails going to the spam folder. This can happen if your email content triggers spam filters or if your subscribers mark your emails as spam. And this is a big problem for any business that invests time and money into creating email campaigns for their business. The most common reasons why Mailchimp emails going to spam include: Many recipients per email Bulk content A large number of emails go to a specific domain. It’s also important to note that Mailchimp has a spam filter built into its system, which checks your email content for spam triggers before sending it out. However, this filter may not catch everything, so reviewing your email content thoroughly before sending it out to your subscribers is important. So, make sure you follow our best practices for sending emails to ensure your emails don’t end up in spam. While Mailchimp can help you improve your email deliverability, it’s not a magic solution. You’ll still need to put in the effort to ensure your emails land in your subscribers’ inboxes. Mailchimp emails going to spamSource: apps.shopify.com 8. Tagging contacts across various buckets can be managed better The drawback of Mailchimp is that it can’t tag contacts based on their actions in an email. For example, if someone opens an email you sent via Mailchimp, it can’t tag that person as “opened” or “unsubscribed.” Mailchimp tracks click and open, but these are only reported at the campaign level. So, Mailchimp is still an excellent tool for email list management and email marketing, but if your goal is to reach out to all of your contacts personally, you might need Mailchimp alternatives. Tagging contacts can be managed better Source: apps.shopify.com 9. Paying only for active subscribers would make it the best Mailchimp offers different pricing plans based on your number of subscribers. They do not offer a “pay only for active subscribers” pricing model. Instead, they charge you based on the number of subscribers you have on your list, regardless of whether they are active or inactive. While it may be ideal for some users to only pay for active subscribers, it’s important to remember that its pricing structure is also difficult to understand if you don’t want to spend much money on your email marketing campaign. This makes Mailchimp users look for an affordable alternative to Mailchimp. 10. An in-built library for stock images could be significant Another potential downside of Mailchimp is that it does not offer an in-built library of stock images. While Mailchimp offers some basic ability to upload your own images, users must source their stock images from other websites or services like Canva. This can be time-consuming and may add additional costs if users need to purchase images from a stock image provider. While an in-built library of stock images could be a convenient feature, it may not be a critical factor for all users when choosing an email marketing service for B2B. This makes users difficult to create stunning emails for their campaigns. However, it’s worth noting that many other email marketing services also provide an in-built library of stock images. 11. Mailchimp data breach. One of the crucial reasons users might want to consider using alternatives to Mailchimp is to protect their information from being accidentally shared with unauthorized parties. Unfortunately, Mailchimp has had some security issues in the past, including a second breach that occurred on January 11th of this year. In this incident, it was reported that someone could access Mailchimp accounts using employee login credentials. This breach affected 133 companies, including well-known names like Woocommerce, Fan Duel, The Solana Foundation, and Yuga Labs. One of the ways this breach impacted customers was by leaking encrypted data, and in the case of Woocommerce, their customers’ names, store URLs, and email addresses were exposed. Woocommerce was proactive in addressing the issue by sending an email to its customers warning them of the breach. In fact, one of their customers even tweeted out as below: Mailchimp data breach Source: Twitter To Wrap Up This! Mailchimp is undoubtedly an excellent email marketing tool offering many features to help businesses connect with customers. However, it’s essential to consider the cons of using Mailchimp before deciding whether it’s the right choice for your business. Moreover, there are plenty of Mailchimp alternatives in the market to consider. If you’re tired of using Mailchimp, try a better alternative to Mailchimp, BayEngage.

Sales Marketing,"Mailchimp Review: Core Features, Pros and Cons, Pricing and More By Stefanos Bournias What’s the first brand that springs to mind when you think of email marketing software? For me, the answer is Mailchimp. And I’d argue that most people in the US would say the same. When it began in 2001, Mailchimp’s smart marketing positioned it as the #1 brand in the email marketing software space. Back in my short-lived corporate days, I used Mailchimp extensively (it was the best tool at the time). Years have passed since and I no longer use Mailchimp today. But millions of people still do, even in the current era of TikTok and plant-based meats. Does being the most well-known brand equate to the best product? And how has Mailchimp improved over the years? Let’s take a closer look and find out! Table of Contents hide What is Mailchimp? Mailchimp’s Pricing Plans Core Features Pros and Cons Final Thoughts What is Mailchimp? Mailchimp Landing Page Mailchimp is a third-party email marketing software that allows you to manage your email lists, newsletters, run automated marketing campaigns, and much more. Mailchimp caters primarily to small businesses. Its heavy users are e-commerce store owners, digital businesses, freelancers, and marketing agencies. Most users use Mailchimp to manage their newsletters, run email marketing campaigns, and set up autoresponder sequences. Mailchimp’s Pricing Plans Mailchimp seems to be competitively priced compared to other email marketing tools, but the costs can increase exponentially as your email list grows. Here are the basic pricing tiers: Mailchimp's Pricing Plans This is the basic pricing plan if paid yearly: $0/month: Free Forever – 2,000 contacts & 1 audience $9/month: Essentials – 50,000 contacts & 3 audiences $14/month: Standard – 100,000 contacts & 5 audiences $299/month: Premium – 200,000+ contacts & unlimited audiences That said, there’s a caveat here. Note how the Essential and Standard pricing tiers mention “up to X contacts.” Here’s how much extra you’ll have to pay if your email list has 10,000 subscribers on the most basic plan (Essentials): Mailchimp Price Calculation $78/month is a significant increase and it goes up to $270/month at 50,000 subscribers. It’s almost double that price on the Standard plan. As you can see, the prices can add up quickly. To give you perspective, you can get lifetime access to SendFox for $49 and manage up to 5,000 subscribers for a one-time fee. (For a one-time payment of $147, you can manage up to 15,000 subscribers.) Let’s see what Mailchimp has to offer for these price tags! Core Features Mailchimp has definitely continued improving their product over the years, adding some neat new features that we’ll cover here. Before we dive into the core features, let’s explore how you can manage the audience on your email list: Mailchimp core features - Audience Dashboard If you already have an email list, you can import it directly into Mailchimp and start managing it. You can also set up sign-up forms, like popups that integrate with your website, to start building or growing your existing list. The tagging feature allows you to label and filter your audience based on location, where they opted into your list from, engagement, activity, and more. By tagging your subscribers, you can segment your audience and send personalized, relevant emails to specific segments. Mailchimp review - Create a segment Now, this is straightforward and most email marketing platforms have this feature. Nothing too special here. However, I do think the built-in survey feature is a powerful addition that you can use to nail down segmentation. That’s about it for managing your email list. Let’s get into the core features! 1. Creating campaigns One of the features that was largely responsible for propelling Mailchimp into the top position in the email marketing space (aside from the fun winking mascot) was the campaigns feature. Mailchimp was one of the first tools in the email marketing space to enable people with zero design skills to design polished emails. Here are some of the campaign types that you can create: Mailchimp campaign types It’s not shown in the screenshot above, but there’s also a new feature that allows you to create and post Facebook ads. I wanted to create a regular HTML email, so I went ahead and clicked on the email template. Here’s where Mailchimp provides you with 3 different options to create campaigns: Mailchimp email template You can either use the layouts (templates) that consist of pre-designed blocks, themes (similar to the layouts except they come with stock images), or code your own design. To use the templates, all you need to do is select one and start adding content or customizing the layout. This is what the editor looks like once you select a template: Mailchimp showcase your product Once you’re in the editor, you’ll see the tools or blocks on the right and the preview on the left. Of course, the UI is that beloved drag-and-drop functionality that enables you to create some neat designs with code-free block building. No code for the win! 2. Automations & Integrations As a marketer, I’m always looking to optimize my workflows. And since I hate repetitive tasks, I automate (or outsource) what I hate doing. That’s why I was so excited to dig into Mailchimp’s integrations and automations. What can you automate with Mailchimp? Mailchimp offers customizable automated workflows for your audience, e-commerce, marketing, and special events. Mailchimp customize automated workflow I like that the platform includes templates that can get you started quickly. The autoresponder templates are solid. Plus, you can set up email sequences to recover abandoned carts, set up a welcome email series, and more in a hot second. There are hundreds of integrations you can choose from whether you’re an e-commerce store owner, blogger, or small business owner. You can integrate with the most popular apps as well some more niche ones. Mailchimp e-commerce That said, the automation template library is small and you only have around 20 templates to choose from. In any case, the most fun part is creating your own automated workflows. And Mailchimp has a pretty neat UI for this that gives you a visual representation of the sequence you’re building. Mailchimp test customer flow The email automation setup is quite robust and gives you the option to set up rules to send follow-up emails based on certain conditions such as opens and clicks. There are also more complicated automations you can set up depending on your goals. The If/Else/Wait logic for mapping your contact’s journey isn’t very user-friendly, but Mailchimp offers a handy resource to help you understand the concepts and get set up. I think companies like MailerLite do a much better job here. Overall, the automations and integrations will suffice for most beginner users. But for more advanced templates and intuitive workflows, you might want to check out Active Campaign (over 500 templates, or “recipes” as they call them) or MailerLite. 3. Reporting: Insights and Analytics Mailchimp’s reporting features are very thorough. They contain essentially everything you need including client, geographic, and social media tracking as well as a Google Analytics integration. Mailchimp reports One of the neatest features here includes smart recommendations that Mailchimp provides you based on your customers’ behavior. For example, if you’ve integrated your e-commerce store to Mailchimp, you can get granular data on how likely a customer is to make a repeat purchase (i.e. purchase likelihood). Mailchimp's feature - predictive insights This feature is commonly known as predictive insights and it allows you to make data-backed decisions on customer behavior. Based on this data, Mailchimp provides you personalized product recommendations for specific customers. Mailchimp also offers other data points like customer lifetime value (LTV), which you can use to easily segment your customers and target high-value customers with personalized messaging. Aaaand that’s a wrap on the features! We’ve gone through some of Mailchimp’s core features, and highlighted some of the latest micro-tools they’ve added to the toolkit. Now it’s time to explore some of the potential drawbacks and advantages. Pros and Cons As mentioned earlier, Mailchimp is the #1 brand in the email marketing space, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the best in terms of features. Like most tools, it’s not a one-size-fits-all platform and it does come with its own drawbacks and advantages. Pros Generous (but feature-limited) “free forever” plan Easy-to-use editor and creating campaigns is a breeze Tons of integrations, so there’s something for everyone Cons Paid plans are expensive (especially if you have a large email list and need advanced features) Marketing automations are not as robust or intuitive as other tools, like Active Campaign Small library of pre-built automation workflows Final Thoughts Mailchimp is one of those tools that has extremely lovable branding, adorable chimp and all. Plus, when it comes to functionality, it offers everything that most users will need. That said, certain features are only available on the pricier tiers. You may find yourself paying a hefty monthly bill if you want full functionality and a quickly growing subscriber base.",MailChimp

As the biggest player in the field, some critics have alleged some complacency by Mailchimp, and a perceived reluctance to respond to criticism.

Sales Marketing,"HootSuite Brian Dean Written by Brian Dean Last updated Oct. 10, 2022 What Is Hootsuite? Hootsuite is a social media management tool with features to help with planning, scheduling, and syndicating social posts. Key features include automatic scheduling, social media monitoring, performance reporting, basic task management and more. Why Is Hootsuite Useful? Hootsuite can save you time with your social media marketing. Instead of logging into each network and posting there one at a time, you can manage Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Pinterest all from one place. And its “Streams” feature can help you stay on top of relevant conversations as they’re happening. Again, you can monitor conversions on different networks from a single dashboard. Hootsuite also has a helpful Analytics feature for in-depth social media performance reporting. If you run an agency, you know that reporting the ROI of social media can be tricky. Hootsuite’s Analytics feature helps you show off your deliverables. Key Features Post Scheduling Though its feature set has grown over the years, Hootsuite’s bread-and-butter feature is still scheduling social media posts. When you schedule a post on Hootsuite, the first thing you’ll do is choose which social networks to post to. Hootsuite – Post to And you can select any that you’ve integrated with Hootsuite. Next, you’ll write the post itself. Hootsuite – New post text And add media, like images (you can either upload your own or use one from Hootsuite’s media library). Hootsuite – Add media And you’ll get a preview of how your post will look. Hootsuite – Post preview Obviously, the exact post will look a bit different depending on where you’re posting. But this preview gives you a general idea. Next, you can select the exact date and time to publish with the “Schedule for Later” feature. Hootsuite – Post schedule That way, you can schedule posts well in advance. You can even use Hootsuite.com’s automatic scheduling feature to let it decide an optimum time for you based on its algorithms. Pretty cool. Once you have some posts scheduled, they’ll show up in your Planner – Hootsuite’s calendar of upcoming posts. This helps keep things organized and lets you see what’s coming up at a glance. You can also draft posts directly on the calendar, and drag and drop them to fill different time slots. Hootsuite – Planner Streams The “Streams” feature lets you easily monitor the different social media channels you’re active on. In your Streams, Hootsuite will show you a constant feed of relevant social media activity. Hootsuite – Streams The most basic way you can use Streams is to keep an eye on your own mentions in real-time. But you can also set them up to show you posts using certain keywords, hashtags, or posts from specific social media accounts (like influencers or VIP contacts). And of course, you can do this for any of Hootsuite’s supported social media networks. Then you can respond quickly (right from within Hootsuite), regardless of where the conversation is happening. Hootsuite – Streams – Tweet reply Needless to say, this is a massive time saver if you’re active on several social accounts. And if you run an agency with lots of clients, you’ll need a single platform where you can monitor and reply to conversations happening on social media. Streams can also be a great tool for content creation, giving you an ongoing feed of new content to share and comment on. For example, I monitor the “link building” stream on Twitter. Hootsuite – Link building stream And when I see the same topic or angle getting shared again and again, I’ll add it as a post idea to my Content Calendar. Analytics No social media management platform would be complete without reporting. Hootsuite’s Analytics will allow you to see your performance by individual social profile, or via a “mixed” dashboard with all of your connected networks. Key metrics covered include: Fans and Followers Posts and Tweets Engagement Traffic Plus more advanced metrics like: Performance by post Inbound messages with sentiment analysis Total clicks per country Page content clicks Engagement by type And lots more. You can also schedule your reports for automatic distribution via email on a weekly or monthly basis. Great for client reporting! Assignments Hootsuite allows users to assign items to different team members. That way, you can have your social media team work on different tasks from inside of the platform. Hootsuite – Assign to team member This is a critical feature for businesses that do customer service support on social media. For example, let’s say a technical question about your product comes through on Twitter. You can assign that to your IT helpdesk along with a private message providing context. Hootsuite – Support team assignment To assign items to your team, you’ll first need them to make Hootsuite accounts and connect them to your organization within Hootsuite. Once that’s set up, any member of your team can send assignments to themselves or others. To view your own assignments (and items you’ve assigned to others), simply click on the “Assignments” menu item. Hootsuite – Assignments There, you can respond to, reassign, or resolve them. And since Hootsuite integrates with third-party tools like Asana, Salesforce, Slack and more, you can also push assignments directly into your existing workflow. Content Library The Content Library, available to Business and Enterprise users, is another great feature for marketing teams. It allows you to set up templates and pre-approved images that can be used for social posting later. You can also add private notes and tags to each asset. And you can set an expiration date on certain visual assets, which is perfect for holiday-themed images or limited-time offers.",Hootsuite
Sales Marketing,"Hootsuite: At a Glance Hootsuite is a leading social media management tool that streamlines and supercharges the process of managing multiple social media accounts. It is one of the biggest names in the social media management industry as it was one of the first social media management platforms of its kind. Hootsuite ranked as Forbes Advisors’ No. 3 best social media management tool in 2024. In addition to its core features, it uniquely offers a depth of data-driven insights that are hard to come by with competing products. Pros Hootsuite has grown into a very comprehensive platform and yet, despite its long list of features, it is very user-friendly. What’s nice is that it is evolving and improving constantly―with a focus on making the process of simultaneously managing multiple social accounts easier and more efficient. For example, it now integrates with Grammarly to help uphold quality writing and Canva for creating graphics for social posts easily. Cons While Hootsuite was once available for free, that is no longer the case. With plans starting at $99 per year, it’s not the most competitively priced platform in the market. For example, two of its direct competitors cost a fraction of the price, with Zoho Social starting at $10 per month and Buffer at $0. Aside from pricing, another pitfall of Hootsuite is that it only includes training and advanced analytics with its top-tier plan and its support can take hours to respond. How Hootsuite Works With Hootsuite, users can collect all of their social media accounts and manage them simultaneously from one centralized platform. Not only does it streamline the social media marketing efforts but it also helps businesses stay organized with content calendars, the ability to create, schedule and publish posts, manage social ads, engage with your audience and get informative insights based on your social media data and analytics. Hootsuite User Dashboard Hootsuite Core Features As one of the most robust social media management tools, Hootsuite has a large number of features that help businesses manage different social media accounts in one place more effectively. Its core offerings include social media content planning and publishing, audience engagement tools, analytics and social advertising. Content Planning and Publishing Hootsuite’s original main feature was its ability to connect multiple social accounts in one place and use one content calendar to schedule and publish content―and it’s still one of the key features today. It has a robust content calendar where users can view and edit all upcoming posts. In my experience, I found its post creator to be very a user-friendly tool, largely because it is very intuitive. It comes complete with the ability to upload images or graphics, add images from its built-in stock library or design visuals with Canva directly through the Hootsuite interface. When its time publish the post, users can choose to publish immediately or select a future date when Hootsuite will automatically push it live. Additionally, it also has features that are designed help assist users create and publish content more easily. For example, it has a built-in artificial intelligence (AI) writing assistant to help users craft compelling social content. It also has an “Inspiration” section to help you come up with new content ideas, repurpose high-performing content and convert website content, such as blog posts, into social posts. Hootsuite Add New Post Social Media Engagement Tools In addition to helping users build out quality content, Hootsuite also helps users more effectively engage with their audiences. It has a helpful unified social inbox where you can monitor all direct messages across social platforms in one place. As simple as it sounds, it’s a tremendous time-saver and helps ensure that you and your team never miss a message. It also has listening streams to help you identify and stay ahead of trending topics better, auto-responders to answer questions 24/7 and assignment tags quickly to route communications better. Hootsuite Social Inbox Analytics Part of what makes Hootsuite so powerful is its ability to collect, unify and disseminate data across all social accounts with its unified social analytics, giving users great insights that they might be hard-pressed to gain on their own. It has customizable social media analytics reports as well as reports that compare your performance to others in your industry. This way businesses can gauge their own performance to industry benchmarks and use the insights to stay ahead of the competition. Hootsuite Analytics Advertising Businesses that advertise on social, can manage their paid content in addition to their organic content on Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn. How it works is that you can set up “auto-boost” existing ad campaigns through Hootsuite, which auto-optimize effectively based on your set objectives, timelines, criteria and audiences. However, it’s worth noting that you have to set up ad campaigns directly through the ad platforms, such as Facebook Ads to use this feature. This can be an insightful feature for businesses that are interested in streamlining the platforms that they use as ads can be created, deployed and monitored directly through Hootsuite. What’s nice about this feature is that while it makes the process of ad creation really easy, it also gives a great deal of insights. On top of that, businesses can then have an easier way of comparing the performance of their organic content to their paid content. What Sets Hootsuite Apart Hootsuite stands out for two main reasons―and for two reasons that rarely occur in conjunction. First, Hootsuite is extremely feature-rich. It does do just about anything and everything that a social media manager would need to do to perform their job. However, that doesn’t mean you won’t need someone to manage Hootsuite and develop social strategy. The second reason is that it’s extremely easy to use. So, despite offering a wide range of features, it doesn’t have much of a learning curve, making it quick to get set up and a painless process to learn how to use. Hootsuite Pricing and Plans Professional	Team	Enterprise Starting Price (Billed Annually)	$99 per month	$249 per month	Custom Maximum Social Accounts	10	20	50 Maximum Users	One	Three	Five Social Networks	Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube and Pinterest	Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube and Pinterest	Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube and Pinterest Unlimited Posts	Yes	Yes	Yes Draft, Schedule and Publish Posts	Yes	Yes	Yes Post Time Optimization	Yes	Yes	Yes Bulk Scheduling	Yes	Yes	Yes Reports and Analytics	Yes	Yes	Yes Canva Integration	Yes	Yes	Yes Grammarly Integration	Yes	Yes	Yes Roles and Permissions	No	Yes	Yes Social Content Calendar Sharing	No	Yes	Yes Automated Link Tracking	No	Yes	Yes Approval Workflows	No	No	Yes Advanced Reporting	No	No	Yes Professional Plan Hootsuite’s Professional plan costs $99 per month with annual billing and includes the one user and up to 10 social connections. While it’s an entry-level plan, it is still very feature-rich. Users get access to the full content calendar, the ability to create, schedule and public unlimited posts per month, analytics and a variety of social engagement tools, such as an all-in-one centralized inbox and contact management. It’s a good choice for the average business looking to streamline and enhance its in-house social media effort. However, it’s not ideal for large businesses or agencies managing other businesses’ social accounts. Team Plan The Team plan jumps up to $249 per month with annual billing and includes up to three users and 20 social accounts. It comes with everything from the Professional plan, but a handful of additional features, such as automated link tracking and social content calendar sharing. Because it includes more social accounts and users it’s well-suited for medium to large businesses with an in-house marketing team. Enterprise Plan The Enterprise plan has custom pricing and you can request a demo. It includes up to five users and 50 social accounts. On top of the additional users and social connections, it also includes a further depth of insight with more advanced analytics and reporting that data-savvy businesses can use to better inform social strategy. It also includes advanced user permissions, approval workflows, dashboard notifications, campaign planning and more. It’s geared toward large businesses. It may also be a good option for a growing agency managing a limited number of client accounts. Hootsuite Setup The setup process is pretty straightforward and it offers a 30-day free trial to help new users decide whether it’s right for them. To start your free trial, you will first need to input your full name, business email address and password. From there, you will be redirected to a page where you are required to select a paid plan and input your payment information. Be sure to select whether you would like to sign up for a monthly plan or annual plan as it defaults to the annual option. After submitting your payment successfully, you will be prompted to connect at least two social accounts, which include Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok Business, YouTube and Pinterest. It’s very easy to connect, you must have a business account on the social network and have the login information (or already be logged in from your device). Hootsuite Free Trial Sign Up Hootsuite Ease of Use Hootsuite has come a long way for those who tried it years ago. From the outset, it’s easy to set up. The process of connecting social platforms is surprisingly easy―especially if you’re already logged in your social accounts from your device. Once, within the user dashboard, it’s very well-designed and intuitive, making the learning curve very minimal. Granted, it is also very robust so, while it’s very easy, it will take a little time to familiarize yourself with all that it has to offer. Hootsuite Security Hootsuite has a number of built-in security features, that account for infrastructure (with physical and cloud-based data centers), host security, data rights and protection and, interestingly, monetary rewards to users who submit security incidents. For example, if you submit a security incident that is deemed critical, you get a $100 CAD Amazon gift card. Meanwhile, it does not offer many security options for users. For example, while users can set up two-step verification, it does not offer user permissions and controls on its low and midtier plans. Hootsuite Security Hootsuite Customer Service and Support Support is available for users via live chat, which can be accessed from within the user dashboard. You are first connected to a bot that attempts to answer your question, but if you have a question beyond its scope, you are prompted to input your name and email address to be connected to a live agent. It says that users should be connected to an agent within a few minutes. In my experience, I contacted support and over two and a half hours later, had yet to receive a response. According to user reviews, this is not uncommon for Hootsuite support. For a fairly expensive product, its support quality is disappointing. Additionally, it has 24/7 support via Twitter and Facebook. However, this isn’t likely to be a particularly useful support channel for users with technical issues or account questions. As with live support, it’s not likely to provide a prompt response. Hootsuite Additional Features Worth Noting One of my favorite features of Hootsuite, beyond its scheduling and reporting capabilities, is its “Streams” tool, which gives users a Kanban-style dashboard of their social profiles. It displays the performance of your recent posts, a column listing your upcoming scheduled posts as well as social media activity and mentions. Though all of this data can be found elsewhere, it’s a convenient way to check the pulse and performance of each of your social accounts quickly.

To start, Zoho Social starts at $10 per month with annual billing of $15 per month without a contract for up to nine social accounts. While Hootsuite starts at $99 per month (billed annually) for up to 10 accounts. This is a steep price difference for the addition of one account. Granted, Hootsuite is a more robust social media management platform. So, while Zoho Social might be more suitable for startups and small businesses, Hootsuite is generally the better choice for larger, more social media marketing-heavy businesses and brands as well as agencies. Hootsuite vs. Buffer Like Hootsuite, Buffer is another one of the oldest social media management platforms. Buffer is the far better value for those on a budget as it not only offers a free plan, but it also has industry-low prices starting at $5 per month with annual billing or $6 per month when billed monthly. It offers a number of the same features as Hootsuite, although it does lack Hootsuite’s depth. While both are widely considered easy to use, Buffer is more simplistic lending to an overall shorter learning curve. In general, Buffer is better for budget-strapped businesses and those who are looking for a simple way of managing social content calendars more effectively. Meanwhile, Hootsuite is ideal for businesses that place a good deal of emphasis on social media marketing and need the tools to create a well-oiled social media marketing machine. Read more: Check out our detailed Buffer vs Hootsuite comparison. Hootsuite vs. Sprout Social Hootsuite and Sprout Social are two head-to-head competitors that are both comprehensive social media management platforms geared toward businesses that depend heavily on social for sales and marketing as well as agencies managing client’s social accounts. The main difference between the two is not only the Sprout Social is over double the price at $249 per month, but business goals as well. For example, Hootsuite is aligned better with businesses that are looking to bolster their social media presence while Sprout Social is more aligned with businesses looking to better manage customer relationships with its built-in customer relationship management (CRM) and reviews management features. Who Is Hootsuite Best For? Hootsuite is a great solution for data-driven marketing teams looking for a helpful way to organize content, collect data and make informed strategy decisions. Businesses with in-house marketing teams that are looking to save staff time and supercharge their efforts will find Hootsuite to be a good value for price. However, it’s not the ideal solution for those who are looking for a simple content scheduler or agencies looking to manage client accounts. Conclusion Hootsuite is an overall very user-friendly tool that streamlines the process of managing various social media accounts in one centralized place. It can help simplify social media management in general, and it can also help businesses understand their audiences better and optimize content that reaches them more effectively―never mind resonating with them. However, it no longer offers a free version and it’s not the most affordable platform in the market, so it may not be the ideal solution for businesses that won’t take full advantage of its robust data insights.",Hootsuite

These platforms can be used to engage with customers, generate leads, boost sales, and much more. But is creating a presence on social media platforms enough? It’s important to find the right platform where the target audience exists and deliver valuable content to encourage reactions. But how do you determine your target audience? How do you identify the right platforms to concentrate? When is the most effective time to reach out to your target audience? Finding answers to these questions is easier said than done. Without a process in place, it feels impossible. This is where social reporting helps. You can make key strategic decisions regarding your social media initiatives based on social media reports. And in this article, we’re looking into how to use Hootsuite for social media reporting. What is social media reporting? Social media reporting is, essentially, extracting important information from data provided by social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc. on metrics such as no. of likes, views, reach, etc., over a period of time. The insights provided by social media reporting can help you make more informed, smarter, and refined social media decisions, maximizing ROI with every dollar spent on organic and paid campaigns. Social media reporting offers you a plethora of information to generate leads, build customer relationships, boost sales, and create share-worthy content that your audience wants to read and consume. Importance of social media reporting From boosting brand awareness to generating leads and reaching out to potential customers, social media can be a goldmine for B2B businesses. However, navigating the enormous amount of data provided by social media can be confusing, overwhelming and tough. If you’ve ever had trouble attributing your growth to any of your efforts on social media, it’s time for you to learn about social media reporting. Social media reporting assists you in organizing a large volume of data and extracting crucial insights, in addition to providing detailed reports on ongoing campaigns. Here are a few reasons why we think social media reporting is important for your business: 1. More creative content Social media reporting can help you create more effective content by providing a detailed report on the ideal post length and the most engaging content – both in terms of format and topic that your audience responds to the most. 2. More effective outreach Social media reporting can help you determine the best time and day of the week to interact with your current and potential customers. For instance: Carousels might perform better on Mondays and Thursdays, while other days, your reels might see huge engagement. You can also get insights about which topic resonates the most with your customers on which day, making it possible to run personalized outreach campaigns. 3. Better understanding of your audience Not all social media platforms are the same. As a result, you’ll require a platform-specific strategy. It is not just about providing content but also about reaching the right target audience on the right platform. As a result, social media reports provide detailed insights into the kind of audience your content is reaching to on each platform, allowing you to make informed decisions. As a B2B business, it is important to keep your efforts streamlined. 4. Strong brand positioning Social media reports help you in strong brand positioning by identifying new competitors and allowing you to put more effective strategies in place to stand out, or even build partnerships with other brands that will help you reach wider audiences. 5. Customized reporting Each organization has different objectives and goals for their social media outreach. The data extracted from social media reports can be used to achieve your social media goals. Obtaining social media reports is one aspect of your social media strategy. There’s a lot more to it, such as planning, research, and scheduling. Managing all of this manually, even if you have a social media team, can be stressful at times. Many social media management tools do this to help you focus on the core areas of your business. Now, this is where we’re going to introduce you to how we’re using Hootsuite for social media reporting. What is Hootsuite? What if you could have a platform that handled all aspects of your social media manager’s job? Hootsuite, a social media management platform founded by Ryan Holmes in 2008, does a similar (or even better) job. It helps you plan, schedule, and synchronize your social media posts and gives you key metrics to help you analyze your social media goals. You get a complete picture of your social media goals in one place, eliminating the need to check each platform separately. The following statistics make it clear why Hootsuite is a leader in social media management – More than 18 million customers use Hootsuite. More than 20% of companies use Hootsuite to manage their social media accounts. Hootsuite was crowned as the Best Social Media Scheduling Software at the 2021 MarTech Breakthrough Awards.

Let’s have a look at the points below to see why Hootsuite is such a popular choice – 1. Easy to understand analytics Hootsuite gives you a unified view of all your social media channels. You can even set and change benchmarks over time. The information and figures included in the reports are easy to understand. These reports can even be tailored to your organizational goals.

It provides you with insights that will assist you in taking action toward your future goals. Source: Hootsuite 3. Improve your ROI It’s important to monitor the return on investment (ROI) of social media campaigns to evaluate if the outcomes outweigh the costs. The dashboard’s easy-to-read graphs, tables, and KPIs make it simple to identify discrepancies and improve your future ROI. 4. Improve your customer support Customers wait an average of 20 seconds for a response to their question. As a result, providing quick, reliable, and engaging customer service is important. Hootsuite provides detailed information on response time and top performers. To improve overall performance, ask the top performers to share their strategies with the rest of the team. 5. Stay on top of user information Hootsuite offers you a free analytics report every week. The reports give you information on the number of clicks, popular links, and other user data that you can use or send to your clients. Hootsuite offers features that no other platform can match. Users may easily schedule, monitor, and evaluate their social media using the all-in-one features. Source: Hootsuite Let’s take a closer look at these features! Hootsuite features that make it the best social media reporting tool Hootsuite’s most basic and important feature is still scheduling social media posts. However, over time, the platform has improved its functionalities. 1. Schedule your posts Source: Hootsuite To schedule your social media posts, you have to simply select the platform and integrate it with Hootsuite. Manually, type the post content. Add images, videos or other media along with the post. Source: Hootsuite You’ll get a preview of how your post will look before you proceed. Source: Hootsuite The preview won’t be exactly like the post on the platform, but it is enough to give you a general idea. Next, you can select a date and time to post with the “Schedule for later” feature. This is how you can schedule your posts in advance. P.S – Hootsuite’s automated tool also provides a general indication of when your post will perform best based on its algorithms. Isn’t it great? 2. Streams Source: Backlinko If you use multiple social media platforms or run an agency with many clients, we know how hard it can get to keep track of all these platforms. The best way to manage your accounts is to use “Streams,” a popular Hootsuite feature. With the feature, you can keep an eye on relevant social media activity. You can use the feature to show you posts related to a few keywords, hashtags, or posts from specific social media accounts. You can easily build connections and start the conversation when you get a real-time update on social media activities. For instance: You can add the keyword “Crypto” as a stream on Twitter. You can easily view conversations regarding the same keyword. If you come across something important, don’t miss to add it to your calendar. 3. Analytics Source: Hootsuite We think “reporting” is the ultimate goal of any social media platform. Hootsuite analytics offers you a complete insight into all the social media platforms in one place. You can even track your performance by individual social media profile. Since we are talking about social media reporting, we think this feature is of utmost use for every B2B business. The feature provides a comprehensive view of all social media channels within a single tool. Over 30 individual report “modules” are available through a redesigned launch bar in Social Analytics. Users can choose from various modules in any combination to create unique reports, or they can choose from a number of pre-made report templates for quick reporting. The best thing is that these reports can be customized according to your business or social media goals. For instance, you can monitor brand mentions, link clicks, demographics, top-performing content, and so on. Now you don’t have to juggle between several measuring tools because Hootsuite analytics features provide a complete analysis to understand the effect of each social media platform. You can get reports regarding multiple social media campaigns with clear analysis to conclude. Once you have the detailed reports, you can adjust according to new campaigns and your reporting needs. It’s easy to share your reports not only with team members but any Hootsuite user. You can authorize clients or people from different departments to view reports with Hootsuite. Reports can be sent via email to the chosen recipients daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis. Hootsuite users with any plan – Basic, pro and enterprise can use this feature. Downloading reports, however, require points*. You can select the desired action based on the points you have collected. *Hootsuite reports and analytics work on a points-based system. These points can be purchased separately in the final step of completing your analytics reports. A Pro user gets 50 points for generating reports every month. If you are a Free account user, you will be required to upgrade your Hootsuite account. Once you have finished adding modules to your report you can see the points counter at the top of your dashboard. If you exceed the available points, as an indicator, the number of points changes to red. Hootsuite is making its features more relatable, useful and customized to help businesses and organizations to boost their social media campaign ROI. 4. Assignments Source: Hootsuite This is the most underrated feature of Hootsuite, which allows you to assign tasks to your team members. This feature can help businesses to expedite their customer support service. For instance – If someone has raised a query on Twitter regarding your product or service. You can assign this task to your I.T. helpdesk along with a private message providing context. To assign tasks, you have to create Hootsuite accounts for an individual team member. Once that’s set up, any member of your team can send assignments to themselves or others. Pro tip: Hootsuite can also be easily integrated with third-party tools such as Asana, Salesforce, Slack, and others, allowing you to push assignments right into your existing workflow. What platforms can Hootsuite manage? We’ve seen Hootsuite’s potential and what it can accomplish. Is the social media management tool, however, capable of integrating all social media platforms? Hootsuite used to be restricted to solely scheduling and analyzing written content, but in 2016, the company added video integrations with YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This will aid businesses in reducing the difficulty of managing video content while also increasing reach. Today, video content is an important aspect of any company’s marketing strategy. Companies have benefited greatly from video platforms like Instagram reels, TikTok, and YouTube. Hootsuite connects all major social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Linkedin, allowing businesses to manage video content and other social media activities. Users can also monitor comments and interact securely as a team to manage several accounts, allowing them to respond to consumer inquiries faster. Companies can use Hootsuite to manage not only their accounts but also the accounts of their clients. How to create a report on Hootsuite? You may collect data and create reports for social media platforms using Hootsuite analytics. If you manage an agency, you know how difficult it can be to generate social media reports. On the other hand, Hootsuite allows you to create several reports, customize and export them. Let’s have a look at how to use Hootsuite to create reports step by step. Go to the Analytics page. Select Expand Navigation > Select New Report if the Analytics navigation is not displayed. Source: Hootsuite To discover a template quickly, type a search term into the top search box. On the left, you may also choose a report category. You can choose from the following categories depending on your plan: Facebook Twitter Instagram Business LinkedIn Pages LinkedIn profiles Custom report Amplify Team (for Enterprise customers with Team Admin permissions) Insights Impact Ad Analytics Source: Hootsuite 4. For customized reports, you can choose from a variety of metric libraries. Choose a social network and look for a metric, or use the search field to look for specific metrics (those that start with the word ‘Post’). Source: Hootsuite Add metrics to your report Source: Hootsuite A single report can display up to 100 tiles, but you can add an endless number of tiles. From the Analytics navigation, choose the report that will contain the new tile To open the Metrics library, select Add metric. You can choose from numerous libraries of metrics depending on your plan. Select a social network from the Metrics library and search for a metric.

Select Customize to change the tile’s title or to choose a compare or sort by option. You can also modify the visualization type or make your tile a different size. Increase the size of your tile if your info isn’t being displayed. Source: Hootsuite Add the metric into your report. The Metrics library appears when you add a metric to your report.

No. Scheduling is one feature of Hootsuite; apart from this, you can access social media reports from all the platforms and even assign tasks directly to your team. 4. Can I access Hootsuite on mobile devices? Yes. Hootsuite offers a mobile app for both iOs and Android users to directly manage their social media activities and conversations on their mobile devices. Now managing your social media is easy even when you’re on the go. Other Hootsuite alternatives Are you looking for a social media management tool that is similar to Hootsuite? Social media management can be done with a variety of tools. These platforms, however, are very similar to Hootsuite. These tools may offer more or fewer features than Hootsuite. Let’s take a look at all of the alternatives we’ve tried. 1. Sendible Sendible is the best Hootsuite alternative. It also allows you to connect to all major social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and others. You get an overview view of your social media accounts, similar to Hootsuite, as well as a social media inbox that allows you to respond to all messages, comments, and tweets from a single platform. People may share your content without tagging you at times. To maintain track of your brand, Sendible has a tool called “social listening.” It’s a useful platform and a great substitute for Hootsuite. 2. Sprout Social Sprout Social is a great alternative to the Hootsuite team and enterprise account. It also has a social inbox and a social media calendar to help you keep your team organized. The built-in CRM/task management tool is what we enjoy most about this platform. The tool allows team members to add and request content approval in real-time. Cool. Isn’t it? The features provided by this platform are exceptional; however, the prices are extremely high. 3. Buffer Buffer is another popular Hootsuite option, although we believe it is best for individual users. Buffer is a basic scheduling tool that lacks features such as “streams” and “social media inbox.” Your social media postings can be easily created and scheduled. Like Hootsuite, it gives metrics so you can observe how well your postings are performing. This is your go-to social media management tool if you don’t have to deal with several clients and don’t need a lot of detailed analysis. 4.SocialPilot We’ve tried both Hootsuite and SocialPilot, and they’re both the same, in our opinion. However, with a few more features, SocialPilot might have outperformed Hootsuite. Similar to Hootsuite, SocialPilot has a common dashboard that allows you to group different social sites. While using SocialPilot to acquire your RSS feeds, you’ll be able to search for content related to your field. Hootsuite, on the other hand, lacks this feature. If finding content isn’t a priority, Hootsuite will suffice to accomplish your social media goals. Pros of using Hootsuite You may have realised the value of Hootsuite for social media analytics and why we love this tool. If you’re still not convinced we have a few more reasons for you to love it. Having the opportunity to access all of your social media platform metrics in one location is really useful for a company trying to grow its online presence. Analyzing social media engagement metrics to learn about your audience’s pain points and interests is simple. The best thing is that you can download the report data and export them in PDF or PPTX format in professional and team plan. However, with business and enterprise plan you can also export files to XLSX and CSV format in addition to PDF and PPTX format. The platform’s metrics and reports are simple to understand. These reports can easily be shared with your team members and clients. What can be improved? Hootsuite is one of our favorite social media reporting tools, and we always recommend it to our clients. However, we believe that there are a few features that can be improved for a better user experience. For some people, using the Hootsuite dashboard can be overwhelming. Learning the UI can be difficult for team members. And so we believe the UI can be beginner-friendly. The cost structure of reporting here isn’t optimal because it’s based on the number of reports and the number of things you wish to measure. You can only use the ow.ly URL shortener. This isn’t a problem for most people, but if you have your own short URL or use a different provider for statistics, Hootsuite isn’t for you. Hootsuite offers many bells and whistles, and we think users don’t need to know all of them. Small businesses can use basic features to manage their social media activities. Conclusion With the increased use of social media and rising competition, getting comprehensive reports regarding your social media efforts is important. The reports offer you insights that lead to successful social media campaigns and increased ROI. Hootsuite is a one-stop solution to get actionable insights to maximize your social media engagement. Imagine getting analytics of all social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin in one place. This helps you save time and effort to check each platform. What organizations need in terms of analytics will vary from business to business. Hence, you can customize social media reports provided by Hootsuite to your social media goals. Moreover, getting analytics is one part of these tools; there’s a lot more to it. You can also create, schedule, and manage all your social media accounts in one place. So, if you’re searching for a social media reporting tool that’s more than just a scheduling tool, give Hootsuite a try and see if it meets your needs.

But our editorial integrity ensures our experts’ opinions aren’t influenced by compensation. Terms may apply to offers listed on this page. Covering the basic needs for community management across various social media platforms, this tool is a reference in its industry. Let’s look at what Hootsuite is. “Tout de suite” is a French expression which means “right away”. Add an owl to the equation and you get “Hootsuite”, the name of one of the most popular social media platforms for small business marketing. Hootsuite is a social media management tool that makes social media for small businesses more manageable and profitable. Overview: What is Hootsuite? Hootsuite is a software as a service (SaaS) platform which connects a number of social media accounts to a centralized social media management console. Community managers can connect to just one platform and manage several social media networks from one central spot, rather than manage a number of individual social media profiles separately. What is Hootsuite used for? Hootsuite lets the community manager execute on a social media strategy, by planning ahead, scheduling and gathering data into one report. The platform allows social media teams to monitor activity and interact with users. Using Hootsuite for planning social media activity Planning and post scheduling are two of the key activities in social media management and planning of a social media content calendar. In the Hootsuite Calendar view, the community manager picks a time slot to plan a publication to one or more of the connected social media networks. The Calendar view presents an overview of planned posts. Hootsuite's Calendar View A post can be scheduled to publish to several social networks simultaneously at a future date and time in the Calendar view. Image source: Author Using Hootsuite for engagement One of a community manager’s most important tasks is to respond and engage with users in a timely manner. Hootsuite allows you to monitor engagements with your social media accounts, and to quickly identify engagement opportunities when a user or business mentions your social media profile. Time is of the essence, and it’s very important to respond or enhance the discussion and generate an increased awareness around your post. Hootsuite centralizes a social media inbox of direct messages addressed to the connected accounts. Messages arrive in a central inbox where the community manager can respond directly to each message. Hootsuite's Streams view In the Streams view, social media publications and account mentions can be monitored. Image source: Author Using Hootsuite for social media reporting Social media analytics is another key task in social media management. Hootsuite reports on activity across several social media networks in one common interface. To do this, the tool connects to the reporting interfaces of the various networks and aggregates the data in its centralized reporting interface. Hootsuite's Reporting Post Activity from several accounts can be compared in Hootsuite. Image source: Author Using Hootsuite for boosting posts Social media algorithms have reduced the organic reach of posts over time. This means an unsponsored post is seen by less people than formerly. Sponsorship is a way for social networks to monetize their otherwise free service. A publication is rarely seen by all the fans or followers of a profile. Therefore community managers use this form of advertising to “boost” the reach of individual posts. This can be done directly from the social media profile, as is the case for advertising from a Facebook business page. Hootsuite, via its integration with social networks, allows users to perform this basic advertising function directly from its central console. More advanced social media campaigns typically use other forms of social media advertising than “boosting” and shouldn’t be performed through a social media management tool. Using Hootsuite for scheduling posts Post scheduling is one of the most beneficial and time-saving tasks social media management tools can help you with. This is typically reserved for business pages, but the tools are increasingly allowing the user to schedule posts on personal profiles too. When scheduling posts on a personal Instagram page, this tool can schedule a notification allowing you to post via your smartphone at the scheduled time but cannot automate publication. Top features for all Hootsuite users Hootsuite covers the basic social media functions: planning posts across multiple social networks, monitoring activity, and reporting on performance. Hootsuite stands out for a number of reasons which we will go through below. 1. Learn the basics of social media management at no cost Hootsuite provides this service for free. The Hootsuite free plan allows the user to connect three social networks, and post a limited number of times per month. This is a great opportunity to learn the ways of social media management and become familiar with the way the tool works. For someone just starting out with social media, initial needs will be limited to a few social networks and few postings anyway. The tool can be a great aid in starting out with social media management. Hootsuite offers an upgrade to a Professional account once you need to post more or add more social networks. 2. Boost posts on social networks Boosting is where a post’s reach is amplified by investing in a small advertising budget and is a great addition to the tool. We distinguish between community management functions and social media advertising, and “boosting” lives in both of those universes. Hootsuite makes boosting available to community managers and very easy to use. 3. Create streams to monitor activity and engagement Hootsuite allows you to create a number of streams. Each stream monitors an account or a social media handle and shows posts in a chronological order with the most recent post appearing at the top. This is a good way to view recent activity and get a feel for the flow of an account. Monitoring social media mentions can help the community manager react in a timely manner and interact with other social media profiles. 4. Report on social media activity across networks Reporting across various social media platforms is a challenge Hootsuite addresses in a configurable reporting environment that can be viewed from several angles. Hootsuite reports on followers, engagement, posts and page clicks and collects some metrics for each of the social media networks connected to the account. Hootsuite's Multiple Account Comparison Report Hootsuite gathers data from multiple social media platforms and integrates them into one overview report.

Brands that actively manage their social media presence, engage with their audience, respond to online reviews and customer feedback, and demonstrate authenticity are better positioned to maintain a positive reputation. Outside of online review websites (like Yelp, Google, and Tripadvisor), consumers turn to social media platforms to learn more about businesses. 46% of consumers turn to Facebook, 35% to YouTube, 32% to Instagram, and 20% to TikTok. Answering a complaint on social media can increase customer advocacy by 25%. Positive social media interactions can turn customers into brand advocates. When satisfied customers share their positive experiences, it contributes to building a strong and positive brand reputation. Encouraging and recognizing brand advocates can further strengthen your brand’s image. Hootsuite Features to Manage Your Brand Reputation Hootsuite is a comprehensive social media management platform with a range of features designed to help users manage, schedule, and analyze their social media activities. Below are some features your team can use to manage your company’s social presence and brand reputation management. Social Media Publishing Hootsuite’s social media publishing features allow teams to create and publish content across multiple social media networks in one place. The platform tells you when to post on social media to get the highest engagement; there is also an option for using the bulk social media scheduler. Streamlined approvals also reduce risk and ensure that all your posts are ready to go thanks to a simple approval process that allows team members to review. Meanwhile, if your team is looking for creative inspiration for posts, Hootsuite has built a new AI tool that can instantly generate captions and new post ideas. Brand Monitoring and Social Media Listening If potential and existing customers wish to engage with your brand, they aren’t always going to visit your website, send you an email, give you a phone call, or fill out a survey form. Thanks to social media, they now have the option of tagging your brand on Twitter or Instagram, posting Facebook reviews, or sharing their feedback on other digital channels like Google, Tripadvisor, and Yelp. Hootsuite’s social listening tools help your team avoid delays in responding to customers, regardless of where they choose to engage with your business. Out of the box, the platform lets your team add multiple user accounts so that you can see your brand’s entire social media presence in one place. Specifically, you can create different feeds or “streams” for each account. This allows your social media team to easily keep an eye on (and respond to) different types of user-generated content being published on LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter from a single page. Social Media Analytics and Hootsuite Insights Hootsuite users can also access insights, analytics, and real-time results to help them understand and improve their social media performance. This lets your team cut out the guesswork with social media analytics tools that tell you exactly how to grow your brand on social. With Hootsuite, you can track essential metrics like follower growth, post effectiveness, and engagement metrics; you can also generate customizable reports to assess the impact of your social media strategy. Employee Advocacy Amplify is a feature of Hootsuite designed to facilitate employee advocacy on social media. Employee advocacy involves employees sharing company content and messages on their personal social media profiles to help amplify the brand’s reach and engagement. With Amplify, Hootsuite lets team members share pre-approved content, such as company news, blog posts, promotions, and other relevant updates, directly from the Hootsuite platform to their social media profiles. Show Off Reviews With Hootsuite’s social publishing features, teams can show off great feedback and share the best reviews with their social media followers. These types of posts offer valuable social proof to prospects and can serve to guide their purchase decisions.

Here are some of the ways you can use Hootsuite to stay on top of the latest social conversations, feedback, and reviews about your brand.

According to research, 59% of consumers have a more favorable view of brands that respond to customer service questions or complaints on social media. You can also use Hootsuite to track more specific elements, such as keywords, hashtags, and location data. This type of monitoring is helpful for any company that wants to keep tabs on its reputation on social media even when the conversation isn’t necessarily directed toward them in posts. The Voice of the Customer is especially loud on social media, and these insights help you find ways to improve customer service and experience for future patrons. Respond to Reviews Responding to reviews is extremely important, especially for companies that are looking to convert prospects, casual visitors, and review readers into loyal customers. Taking part in the conversation and demonstrating that your brand cares about reviews and unsolicited feedback can have a significant impact on your company’s reputation and bottom-line performance. Apart from monitoring social media content, teams can use Hootsuite streams to quickly respond to online reviews. Using the Hootsuite-ReviewTrackers integration, users can post review responses through Hootsuite, helping build brand trust and demonstrating that your company cares about customer feedback. Interpret Data and Act on Insights Gaining customer insights from social media is crucial for several reasons, as it provides your organization with valuable insights that can inform strategic decisions, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall performance. You can use Hootsuite to capture valuable customer feedback and actionable insights into the customer experience.

Sales Marketing,"Hootsuite: A Detailed Overview and Recommended Use Cases Last Updated on September 19, 2022 by Randy A. Brown 4 Comments Hootsuite: A Detailed Overview and Recommended Use Cases Blog / Resources / Hootsuite: A Detailed Overview and Recommended Use Cases It’s no secret that having a strong social media presence is important to business success. One problem we often face is the vast number of social networks to keep track of and share to. Handling too many makes it difficult to have a powerful presence on any of them.

Measure your team’s performance and see how long they take to respond and resolve posts, mentions, and comments that are assigned to them. Premium plans add Powerpoint and Excel as export options. Recommended Ideal Use Cases Here are a few ways that Hootsuite can be used. Keep Up to Date with Industry News Social networks are some of the best ways to get the latest information about your industry. If there’s some buzz going around, it will be on social media. The problem is many of the industry leaders are either on different networks or mostly publish on their own websites. Of course this would normally mean you’d have dozens of websites and networks to explore and that can turn into a disaster quickly. Use Hootsuite to create streams of those you follow. This not only includes their social networks, but also their RSS feeds. You can then share the latest news and trends and possibly be seen as a go-to source for information, grow your social following, and improve engagement. Managing a Social Media Team Hootsuite gives you several tools to manage a small or large teams. Appoint team leaders to approve posts for their team and track their activity. Pre-approve posts that the team can share. You could also place content within the cloud that can be shared. Add internal communications apps, such as the Amplify app, and communicate with your team through Hootsuite. This lets you work and manage your team from a single app, making them aware of resources and announcements. Manage the Social Media Strategy of a School or Company Social media is a great way to attract talent, raise awareness of your programs and opportunities, engage with students and prospects, inform current employees and students of events, etc. Hootsuite’s studies show that 3 out of 4 students used social media when deciding where to enroll in 2015 and 57% of colleges and universities use social media to raise money from donors. Companies that seek top-level programmers, engineers, or other high-quality talent could get similar results by being the company to follow on social media. Hootsuite makes this easy with its scheduling and sharing possibilities. Ending Thoughts Hootsuite is a powerful platform. Even though it has a lot of features, the interface is still simple and intuitive. The free version has enough features for the majority of uses, but new features can be added for free or inexpensively through apps, or by upgrading to a premium plan. If you’re looking for a powerful platform to manage multiple networks and curate content, Hootsuite is worth considering.",Hootsuite
Sales Marketing,"Pros Stellar range of features in automation and email marketing Unlimited automation branching White glove new user onboarding service Convenient integration with Salesforce apps like Einstein Cons Too expensive for smaller SMBs Lacks standalone mobile apps Salesforce Pardot Specs Free Plan A/B Testing Social Media Marketing All Specs Smaller businesses might get sticker shock at Salesforce Pardot's $1,250 per month subscription costs, but frankly, for what's included under the hood, professional digital marketers will consider that money well spent. As an all-up marketing automation solution, Pardot has few peers due mainly to it's very deep feature well that includes list-building features, lead-scoring packages, contact tags, campaign rules, and a host of other automation capabilities. But even with all that potential complexity, Salesforce has managed to design Pardot so it's easy to use, even the analytics and integration modules. Yes, it's costlier than most of the other packages we've reviewed, but because it strikes such a nice balance between broad capabilities and ease of use, we're awarding it our Editors' Choice designation in the marketing automation category, along with fellow competitors Campaigner and HubSpot. If you can afford it, this platform has it all, including a Quick Start Onboarding Package that'll assign you a Pardot Implementation Manager who can greatly accelerate getting your team trained up and running on the platform. You Can Trust Our Reviews Since 1982, PCMag has tested and rated thousands of products to help you make better buying decisions. Read our editorial mission & see how we test. Email Marketing and Integration Many customers use Pardot as an email marketing solution, and we've tested it that way, too. Here, Pardot continues to lead the pack, again based on that intuitive interface coupled with a good feature selection that includes all the hits, like A/B testing, segmentation, and dynamic content generation. However, our Editors' Choices in that category, Campaigner and Mailchimp were still easier to use, though Pardot is very close behind and still very capable in this space. Pardot comes with excellent out-of-the-box integrations with other Salesforce platforms, notably Einstein Analytics, which can add a valuable and actionable business intelligence (BI) layer quickly and easily. And while it's not part of our customer relationship management (CRM) product roundup, the tool does have CRM modules available. However, most customers will probably opt for integrating Pardot with the company's flagship CRM, Salesforce Sales Cloud. That will likely be a trend no matter which vendor platform you select as there’s a consolidation trend going on in email marketing right now, where we're seeing products offer deeper integration with proprietary or third-party partner CRM suites in an effort to broaden their capabilities and attract new customers. Solutions like SendInBlue and Zoho Campaigns have recently expanded their feature set or latched on to other solutions by the same vendor through integrations. Sales automation, similarly, is an increasingly popular hook that can offer a more dynamic range of marketing solutions. Salesforce Pardot is different in that it was created to fit within the larger Salesforce solutions ecosystem. The advantage for businesses already tied into Salesforce is a more seamless and organic expansion of functionality. Fortunately for Salesforce, Pardot's B2B marketing automation is easily extended without resorting to third-party integration since Salesforce has not only a large and fully compatible software portfolio of its own but also a huge partner ecosystem of approved software add-ons and integrations. This lets Pardot users build highly individual and customized automation solutions without the headache of full-on custom development. To be fair, though, most companies will need to have Salesforce specialists on-staff to handle both the integration work and the automation setup as those layers aren't built around point-and-click operations. New Developments and Features For 2020, Salesforce Pardot has added customizable email resubscribe messages, Handlebars Merge Language and Snippets support for forms and landing pages, and a new export API. Pardot users also get Einstein-powered behavior scores on prospect records and as criteria for automation rules. It is now possible for Pardot admins to determine the default message that appears across forms, and marketing users can customize their messages on a per form basis. This functionality is available for Pardot accounts with the Handlebars Merge Language (HML) option enabled. Marketing users can now personalize content with merge fields. Plus, they no longer have to switch between the legacy merge language and HML as they work on different assets in Pardot. For more nuanced analytics, Einstein Behavior Scoring makes it an option to use behavior scores as criteria in automation tools. Einstein Behavior Scoring tells you which customers show the strongest buying signals, and now you can use these scores to further target your marketing segments. Customization and personalization are high on Pardot's feature list, which makes it ideal for businesses with very specific marketing needs. Pardot Pricing The standard Growth Pardot plan costs $1,250 per month for up to 10,000 contacts when billed annually. This plan includes email marketing, prospect tracking, lead scoring, 50 forms, 50 landing pages, chat support, as well as standard Salesforce CRM integration. The Plus plan costs $2,500 per month for up to 10,000 contacts when billed annually. In this middle tier plan, Pardot offers A/B and multivariate testing, email analytics, Google AdWords integration, application programming interface (API) access, and an integrated marketing calendar. The Advanced plan, which we tested, costs $4,000 per month for up to 10,000 contacts when billed annually. It includes access to Einstein AI technology. This plan offers custom user roles and permissions, custom object integration, a dedicated IP address, predictive lead score, and behavior scoring. All plans give you a capacity for 10,000 contacts which should cover the needs of most small to midsize businesses (SMBs). Salesforce Engage, which is $50 per month per user add-on option, gives you access to real-time alerts when contacts open a marketing email and read it. For example, if you send out a note about a Cyber Monday sale in your store. Engage will send you an alert in Pardot when your customer opens the email. The proactive alerts are useful and a feature that you'll also find in products such as Infusionsoft by Keap. Salesforce Pardot 2020 Automation Features Clicking on a contact's record in Engage also provides email templates you can use to send off a note. The advantage of Salesforce Engage is it could reveal trends may help close deals faster. Interactive dashboards are highly informative and assist reps monitoring and controlling their campaign's success. Salesforce Engage also makes it possible to access a live and customizable feed of prospect activity on your phone, tablet, or desktop, so there's no excuse not to jump on prospective deals. Pardot has the highest starting price of any of the marketing automation tools we reviewed. In its class, you'll find tools such as the aforementioned HubSpot, our marketing automation Editors' Choice tool for SMBs. However Pardot offers a cheaper price starting at $1,250 for 10,000 contacts compared with Hubspot's price of $3,200 for 10,000 contacts. With Pardot you can't choose a package with less than 10,000 contacts which might be an issue for smaller companies wanting to get started with email marketing but whose smaller contact base cannot justify the expense. Businesses with more modest requirements will be better served by products like Infusionsoft by Keap . That package costs $200 per month for 10,000 contacts, 50,000 emails per month, and access for up to five users. The package also includes Infusionsoft's four core feature sets (CRM, e-commerce, marketing automation, and sales automation). Infusionsoft by Keap is a superb example of a modern and flexible solution priced just right for SMBs. If you need a product that can scale as you grow, then Zoho Campaigns offers a pay-as-you-go plan in which you buy and use email credits. The credits are applied based on a number of emails you can send. These Zoho Campaigns plans begin at $12 for 500 credits, meaning 500 emails. Or you can send 5,000 emails for $80, and up to $750 for 100,000 credits. Monthly subscriptions, which include unlimited emails, begin at $5 for up to 500 subscribers, all the way to $750 per month for up to 120,000 subscribers. Smaller firms getting their email marketing feet wet will appreciate the flexibility of starting small and ramping up when necessary. Salesforce Pardot 2020 Fields A Slick Interface As you'll find with most Salesforce-associated products, Pardot's dashboard is very clean, with easy to read tabs and icons. Most users find it easy to navigate the tool regardless of how deep into the weeds they might get. Pardot uses a left-hand navigation setup that we found useful for quick data consumption. However, Pardot has taken an added step of letting you collapse the navigation rail depending on how much room you need to view your reports or to expand your automation sequence branches. Pardot's prospect profiles give you easy access to interaction history that you can use to plan or revise campaigns that target this specific user. You'll have information on how prospects entered your database, how they've been contacted, which emails they opened, and which emails they deleted. You can even add notes to the profile and assign a prospect to a specific marketer who might be able to better bring the prospect along the marketing pipeline. Like Zoho Campaigns, which features a very basic What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) email builder, Pardot's not going to win any awards for building one-off email templates. It's a very simple builder that lets you add text and images. If you need a fancier email, then you can drop in HTML code to create your own emails and templates. Pardot does offer 39 pre-set email templates, which should be more than enough for you to accomplish most standard email-creation tasks. If you're going to spend the bulk of your time in the email builder, then check out SendinBlue's builder, which is one of the more complex and creativity-inspiring builders we reviewed, or HubSpot's, which is also feature rich and super intuitive. Once the email or template is created, you can pop into the Testing tab to see how the email will look on various clients. You can see how the email will look on every browser, email client, and device. This is a genius feature that you'll only find in Pardot among the solutions we've tested. You can also analyze the potential for spam to see if you pass tests, including the spam engines used by Google Gmail, GMX, Mail.com, and Microsoft Outlook. The Engagement Studio is where your automation campaigns are created. This is one of the best automation branching sequence builders we've tested, rivaled only by Infusionsoft. To create a sequence, you'll be asked to name the campaign and select a folder in which the campaign will live. You'll also be asked to name a recipient list, suppression lists, and the time you'd like the emails to be sent. Once you've added these details, you'll be directed to a map that features a start, end, and a ""plus"" sign. Click the plus sign to add an action, trigger, or rule. Within each of these options, you'll find a drop-down list of activities that will define the next step of your sequence. The only thing missing from the Engagement Studio is the ability to drag and drop new actions or triggers into your sequence. Otherwise, it's one of the easiest sequence builders you'll find. It's an infinite pallet that places no restrictions on the number of east, west, north, or south branching options you provide. This means you'll be able to create a custom automation campaign that can feature endless options, actions, and reactions. You won't find that on tools such as Zoho Campaigns. Within Engagement Studio, you can pretest the process of an automated program to see how it reacts. This is essentially a fire drill automation campaign to ensure your complex branching doesn't lead to a dead end or a duplicate email. Pardot offers in-depth reporting that lets you see a step-by-step examination of your sequence to determine where recipients are leaving or converting within the sequence. This lets you switch out a specific part of an automation build rather than having to start from scratch if your marketers aren't seeing the results they'd like to see. Social Media Marketing Depending on which plan you're on, you'll gain access to a host of superb multichannel tools that you won't find on most strict marketing automation tools. For example, unlike Infusionsoft, Pardot lets you create social media campaigns. The tool lets you schedule and send posts in real time to Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter simultaneously. You can create an unlimited number of social accounts and schedule and send as many posts as possible. You can also use the tool to view social stats (e.g., how many times a prospect clicked on one of your posts, if he or she shares the post, or if he or she left a comment). Pardot also offers a search marketing tool plugged into Bing, Google, and Yahoo. You can check search engine rankings, monthly volumes, ranking difficulties, run competitor analysis, and monitor your paid search campaigns. No other tool we reviewed offered search marketing functionality. If you opt for Salesforce Engage access, then you'll be able to use Android and iOS apps to connect to Pardot in order to view all of your leads and actions. You'll get mobile alerts whenever users download whitepapers or enter information on landing pages. Unfortunately, there are no standalone Pardot mobile apps. Salesforce Pardot Einstein Scoring System Working with Email Marketing Along with email automation, Pardot has very capable email marketing features. We gave Pardot a test run by creating an email campaign to advertise floor lamp deals. We added some contacts (prospects) into the system, and then assigned them to ourselves so they would show up as eligible to receive the email blast. There are two ways to create prospects (or contacts). You create a list, go to each person's record, and add them to that campaign. Another method is to use dynamic list, in which you search for the criteria of a prospect and add the prospects if they match the criteria. You could add certain prospects based on their score and from which campaigns the emails originated. When you import a file of prospects, it has to be in CSV format. XLS doesn't work. Just like with Campaigner, when importing a CSV or Microsoft Excel file, we had to separate the first name and the last name into separate fields, so the software would also recognize as separate fields, like first name and last name. Then we went ahead and created an email campaign. When we entered the editor to draft an email, a template appeared, but it wasn't intuitive on how to edit it. First we chose to add new email list campaign, but then we backtracked to add new email template. Once we sent it out we could access reports that show data like click-through rates, and which emails originated from a certain campaign. If click-through rates aren't high, you can edit the emails to improve them and then send to the next batch with the edits. You can get a behavior score using Salesforce's machine learning (ML) capabilities in the Advanced package. Einstein can learn which prospects are doing the best so you can target those customers with emails. We were unable to access Einstein in our test account because it wasn't linked to a main Salesforce account that includes the Einstein features. The process of finding a list in which to import the prospects was a bit clumsy. We had to assign a campaign to various prospects, but when we tried to tag campaigns, Pardot said those campaigns were ""empty."" We had to select a step called ""Un-delete matching prospects found in the recycle bin during this import"" to select a list item. After we restored prospects from the recycle bin, we were able to assign prospects to the ""Customers"" and ""Monthly Newsletter"" lists. We were also able to complete our importing of contacts from a CSV file. After we created a campaign, we attempted to run an A/B test to compare the effectiveness of multiple emails. However, in our test account, we had a message that these automation-based emails will be blocked. Autoresponders and system emails would not be blocked, however. Salesforce says these email capabilities were blocked in our test account due to ""trust and security reasons"" which usually have something to do with email reputation. That's an important concern, since your account can get flagged as spam if you're not careful. Every day users should contact their email compliance officer when they see a message like this. In our instance, we simply canceled the test. You can select the percentage of the audience you want to test and what criteria will determine the winner (Opens vs. Clicks). We found that Pardot has impressive trigger actions called Completion Actions, in which you can automatically add a contact to your prospect list when they complete a form. It also offers common email marketing features like notifying the sender when a prospect opens an email. Salesforce Pardot Integration Flowchart ABM and Support Pardot contains a host of interesting features designed to expand and improve on what is an already top-notch system. It offers integration with Salesforce Account-Based Marketing (ABM), a tool that automates the work done between sales and marketing teams to identify target accounts, marry data between sales and marketing databases, and execute campaigns to each account's primary decision maker. The tool is backed by Salesforce's Einstein AI engine. To access ABM you need to use Sales Cloud along with Pardot. To access ABM, you'll need the 360-degree view of customers with CRM, which is Sales Cloud, as well as the marketing automation features of Pardot. Support is one area where Pardot has many competitors beat. Salesforce Pardot's phone support is available 24 hours a day, Monday through Friday (ending Friday at 8pm EST). The company has a voluminous and growing knowledge base for self-serve support. I found the chat support to be quite intuitive and responsive to my queries and the knowledge base was replete with information about every aspect of Pardot's operation. Like most Salesforce products, Pardot's support is consultative and it's easy to get a real human on the phone or on email to quickly help solve issues or make suggestions on how to improve your campaign outcome. More importantly for new users and SMBs, Salesforce has a Quick Start Onboarding Package, which is a white glove service assigning a dedicated Pardot implementation manager to each account.

Smaller businesses or mom-and-pop operations will certainly find Pardot daunting, both because it's expensive and has such a dizzying array of features. For small shops and those just starting out with digital marketing, there are much better tools available, like Editors' Choice pick HubSpot, which is both fairly easy to use and has a generous feature set that combines marketing automation with email marketing, sales, and CRM. Salesforce Pardot is an enterprise-class marketing automation behemoth, it is better suited to agencies or sales teams who can make full use of its automation features and deep integrations with the greater Salesforce ecosystem and it earns its place as an Editor's Choice pick for email marketing.",Pardot
Sales Marketing,"What Is Pardot Used For? [10 Frequently Asked Questions Answered] By Lucy Mazalon April 27, 2022 Salesforce Marketing Cloud Account Engagement (formerly Pardot) is a go-to choice for Salesforce customers looking for a B2B marketing automation tool. Not only is it tightly integrated into Salesforce’s core objects, Pardot’s reasonable price point makes it accessible to many organizations, and is appealing to new users as an intuitive tool with a minimal learning curve. While working as a Pardot/Salesforce Consultant, I was geared up to answer questions about Pardot (Account Engagement) – what I noticed, is that the same questions were asked by marketing or IT professionals who were curious about Pardot. That’s why I’ve compiled answers to the most frequently asked Pardot questions, explained by someone who has ‘on the ground’ experience. What Is Pardot and How Does It Work? Pardot is a marketing automation solution that enables marketers to identify prospective customers that are most likely to convert. Marketers discover this by communicating with prospects in the right way, at the right time. Marketing automation aims to treat each prospect as an individual, as they make their way through getting familiar with your product or service, at their own pace. Pardot works by leveraging: What you know about a prospect: the data they’ve submitted through forms, data from your Salesforce CRM, or other platforms. What the prospect does: how they interact with your digital marketing assets, such as your website, social media presence, or offline interactions. What Is Pardot Used For? Depending on the type of business, Pardot can be used for some (or all) of the following: Email marketing: One-off emails to lists of prospects, automated email journeys. Email automation can be based on specific actions, triggers, or ‘wait’ periods. This is suited especially well to lead nurturing. Forms: Capture data from new prospects, or enrich existing prospect records (also, you can specifically request data for the blank fields on the prospect’s record) Engagement History: Compile a log of all activity prospects make across your online assets (website, landing pages, etc). Segmentation: Multiple options are available to split your prospect database into audiences for more targeted marketing. Scoring: Score prospects based on their engagement behavior. Grading: Grade prospects based on how closely their data aligns with your ideal customer profile (demographic and/or firmographic data). Lead qualification: Pardot score and grade combined identifies prospects your sales team should focus on. Social media marketing: post to LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook – then track post engagement. If a prospect is known and tracked in your Pardot database, activity will appear on their Engagement History. Search marketing: Add keywords to track, view keyword SEO metrics, track competitor SEO performance. Marketing analytics: Report on campaign performance, and marketing influenced pipeline (with Campaign Influence). Multi-channel marketing: Thanks to Salesforce’s expansive marketing product suite, Able to link it with others, such as digital advertising (eg Google Ads), advanced website analytics (eg. GA) What Is the Difference Between Pardot and Salesforce? Salesforce is the central hub for all customer interactions. This means that not only are the bulk of sales and service interactions happening in Salesforce, but integrated systems also feed information into Salesforce – all to form a single, comprehensive view on what’s happening. Pardot is a marketing automation solution that is an add-on to Salesforce’s core platform. This tool acts as a middleman between unknown visitors (who have been captured and converted to known prospects), and your Salesforce CRM. You could say that Pardot protects your CRM from prospects that are not indicating they are ‘ready to buy’. Salesforce takes care of lead and opportunity lifecycles, account and contact data, support case management, etc., and for this reason, is mostly geared towards salespeople. Pardot takes care of email marketing, prospect data capture, prospect behavior tracking and scoring, etc. so, it’s geared towards marketers. How Does Pardot Work With Salesforce? Pardot and Salesforce work closely together to leverage all of the data the two platforms gather. While you hear that “Pardot works closely with Salesforce”, here are some specific examples: Bidirectional data sync: thanks to the Salesforce-Pardot connector, Pardot data is synced to Salesforce and vice versa. The two platforms exchange multiple types of data. In a typical organization’s setup, Pardot gives Salesforce new lead information and engagement data, whereas Salesforce feeds Pardot with all that the sales teams are doing – whether leads are qualified/disqualified, how opportunities are progressing, and which products or services the prospect purchased. Most organizations’ funnels are split neatly into ‘top of funnel’, ‘middle’, and ‘bottom of funnel’. Top of funnel: attract and acquire leads using tactics that will drive traffic to your website (SEO, PPC, social media, content marketing. Middle of funnel: engage, nurture and qualify leads using tactics that will get the data you need to qualify prospects. Bottom of funnel: Opportunity lifecycle, where the deal goes through multiple stages in the run up to becoming a new customer. Traditionally, each team would typically play a distinct role with little overlap (left funnel); however, the funnel is now more blurred, where the marketing team supports further down the funnel (right funnel). How is this possible? Marketing automation solutions with solid CRM connectors, like Pardot, can feed data on Opportunity progress or stagnation to send prospects on automated marketing journeys. Plus, it doesn’t stop at the bottom of funnel! Marketing can go beyond, influencing renewals, upsell opportunities, or cancellation. READ MORE: How Do Pardot and Salesforce Work Together? Is Pardot Owned By Salesforce? Yes, Pardot is owned by Salesforce. Salesforce acquired Pardot in 2013 as part of the $2.5B ExactTarget acquisition, now Salesforce Marketing Cloud (Pardot had been purchased by ExactTarget the previous year). Salesforce made the decision to retire all Pardot connectors to other CRMs, in order to double-down on the Salesforce-Pardot connector. Pardot is part of Salesforce due to the acquisition, but also the Pardot Lightning App. Can Pardot Be Used For B2C? Pardot was known as a B2B marketing automation solution for many years before Salesforce amended the messaging. As I mentioned in the previous answer, Pardot is best suited for organizations that have a “considered” sales cycle – which tends to be related to B2B sales – but is not exclusively B2B. Here is a list of some Pardot customers. Yes, Pardot can be used for B2C marketing. If B2C marketers have a high-value product or service, with a “considered” sales cycle, then they will gain value. I’ve worked with B2C organizations that have used Pardot successfully because they tick the criteria I just listed. READ MORE: Pardot vs Marketing Cloud: Key Differences Is Pardot Similar to MailChimp? From the outside, Pardot and Mailchimp appear to have little difference. However, if you have used both tools, you will quickly get to know where they shine. Even though I made a living through Pardot consulting, I have always used MailChimp at The DRIP/Salesforceben.com. The main differences are: How the connection to Salesforce works. The Pardot connector ‘talks to’ more objects, and the sync is reportedly more reliable than with the MailChimp connector. Analytics: MailChimp and Pardot used to be on par when it came to reporting on marketing activity; however, Pardot has surpassed this with educating their customers on Salesforce Campaign Influence, plus, releasing Engagement History and B2B Marketing Analytics. Segmentation: the way MailChimp works is by first creating audiences, then segmenting into groups, and tags. This means that each audience is distinct, but a contact can exist in multiple audiences (with multiple, unlinked records). Pardot, on the other hand, works as one database, where you can segment into multiple lists (like audiences) without duplicating the record. Unique Identifier: Pardot uses CRM ID (Salesforce Lead/Contact ID) whereas MailChimp uses email address, like most marketing automation platforms. This means that if there are two Lead records in Salesforce with the same email address for a reason (ie. deliberately duplicated) then only the first record would be acknowledged by Mailchimp (the rest considered duplicates). MailChimp has a generous freemium version and easy e-commerce plugins. READ MORE: Pardot vs. MailChimp Is HubSpot Better Than Pardot? Is HubSpot better than Pardot? A very tough question! When it comes to HubSpot versus Pardot each platform has its own strengths. Both organizations are innovating at speed, and comparisons become outdated with each release cycle. Yes, you can read opinions with websites like G2 and Capterra, however, here is my take. HubSpot has a reputation for shining at ‘top of funnel’ marketing, especially acing inbound marketing. Pardot focuses on sales enablement and customer journeys involving considered purchases (ie. ones that involve a sales rep). Pardot is limited in terms of out-of-the-box integrations, but it does have some connectors. Marketing App Extensions were brought in to serve up activity data from integrations like any activity data (plus, you should tap into the Salesforce platform for much more integration capabilities which can, in turn, pass data to Pardot). HubSpot integrates with many third-party tools using connectors; their “plug-in-and-play” partner ecosystem has been a priority for them in their growth strategy. READ MORE: HubSpot vs Pardot – What are the Differences? How Can I Learn Pardot? There are plenty of ways to learn Pardot including self-guided learning, instructor-led training, and official certifications that are globally recognized credentials. Options for free Pardot training include: Trailhead: the first stop for anyone who wants to learn Salesforce. Pardot Trailhead trails include: Pardot Lightning App Basics, Pardot Email Sending, Pardot Email Marketing, Pardot Engagement Studio for Pardot Lightning App (and many more!) Pardot Bootcamps: Bootcamps are community-organized events where Pardot experts share what they know about a specific section of the certification exam guide (Pardot Specialist, Pardot Consultant). I really enjoyed presenting on the “Evaluation” section of the Pardot Consultant certification guide; I found it challenging as it’s the hardest section to study for (ie. it’s very broad). Everyone who presents on the bootcamps offers snippets from their own experiences that are immensely valuable to your long-term career. Pardot blogs: these sites offer insights that go into specific use cases or organizational pain points you may encounter. There’s The DRIP, The Spot for Pardot (and many more!)",Pardot

User adoption: Pardot is a complex tool that requires training and a certain level of technical expertise. This can make it difficult for users to fully adopt and utilize the platform effectively.

The Pardot and Salesforce CRM integration offers a wide range of features and tools that can help businesses increase efficiency, improve lead generation and conversion rates. However, costs for large databases (more than 10k contacts) can be prohibitive. In this case, we suggest HubSpot Marketing Hub.

Sales Marketing,"What is Pardot and what does it do for marketing automation Digital Environment 2024.06.07 Salesforce Pardot is a tool that allows you to completely control how many users you are leaving a cookie for, how many have entered the system thanks to your marketing actions, how many are ready to be passed to sales to manage them, how many have received an offer from the sales team, or how many opportunities have been won and have even generated customer acquisition and loyalty journeys, etc. All of this is possible thanks to its great structure. After logging in, we’ll find Campaigns, Forms, Assign to, Opportunities related to the prospect (Candidate or Salesforce contact), Completion Actions, Email Tracking, Automation Rules, Pardot API, Engagement, and much, much more. Marketing professionals have a clear conversion and loyalty funnel at their fingertips, which they can share with different departments at the right time. Pardot allows you to drive, measure and share your Inbound Marketing with different teams, from acquisition to converting prospects into brand ambassadors, through loyalty, all controlled with Pardot's famous Marketing Automation. The origins of Salesforce Pardot The union of Pardot and Salesforce took place in 2013. Salesforce bought ExactTarget that year, when Salesforce’s marketing was just “Campaigns” and some HTML templates with the words “Join us” on the banner. And just then, ExactTarget bought Pardot. Therefore, Salesforce’s purchase was doubled and would cover its future strategy of both B2B and B2C marketing. Marc Benioff said the following: “I hope that the CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) will spend more on technology than the CIO (Chief Information Officer) in 2017.” At the time, the words were received incredulously, but it turns out he was right. The goal was, and still is, to align the sales and marketing departments in a way that would allow for resource optimization and not duplicate communication with prospects. And with Pardot, it was a success. Originally, Pardot was a tool that could stand alone, without a CRM, because of its small “Prospects'' tag that could serve as a mini CRM. It doesn’t have a large amount of data behind it, but it does have detailed information, such as the “Activities” and “Audit” tabs and more information about Scoring and Grading. But above all, Pardot was a walking API, capable of connecting with any CRM, Salesforce or not, until Salesforce limited it in 2018. After this moment, if you wanted to connect Pardot, it must be done to a CRM, and it can only connect to Salesforce itself. What does Pardot do? It’s main functions: Acquisition with Pardot Marketing Automation Client acquisition is the first obsession of any marketing professional, and not for nothing. One of the first goals of a company is acquisition: to attract our possible clients, making conversion easy through attractive content, effective landing pages, attractive emails, tracked content, forms, etc. Pardot’s functions give you the ability to define origins easily, generating clear campaign structures and making it more clear than ever before that for Pardot, UTMs are the tool’s first weapon. Pardot is focused on cookies and pure conversions, a field in which it excels. Pardot allows for not just the creation of landing pages where the content we want to offer can land safely, but also for the registration of all the movements of a prospect. Let’s digress about prospect and its meaning; in Pardot, we are all equal and when qualifying, it doesn’t distinguish between leads and contacts*. Everyone is a prospect, thanks to codes that are inserted into the content that we associate with the platform; later on, they will serve to associate all the activities to a prospect, in addition to allowing us to create email templates or upload our own HTMLs. We’ll discuss forms in the next paragraph. *Previously, when prospects were in Salesforce, Pardot could perfectly identify if they were a candidate or a contact. Salesforce Pardot and Conversion Forms are very important to Pardot. With this tool, filling out a form goes from being a transitional experience to becoming an almost interactive activity. We can choose between forms that fill out 'on their own' as they have already collected data about us (progressive profiling) or forms (Forms & Form Handlers) connected to Salesforce, and that also bring a series of Completion Actions that make things happen as soon as we click on the magic 'submit' key, such as getting an email automatically or becoming part of a list that will feed a journey. And if you forget to include a Completion Action, don't panic: Pardot has some backups for these scenarios, including Automation Rules. What happens if you already have a form that sends data to an excel on your website and you want to improve it with Pardot’s functions? Well, you can link it to the tool through a 'code' that provides the solution called endpoint 'by Form Handler'. Nothing escapes, everything is traced, placed and ready to convert. And not only that, but when it enters the system, the necessary people are alerted, either Sales/Call Center or Owners in Salesforce, and the prospect is placed in lists to start the communication flow. Loyalty thanks to Salesforce Marketing Automation Loyalty is probably another of the main obsessions of a marketing professional. It deals with resolving the necessities of a prospect and maintaining the relationship at the same time, adapting to new demands. Pardot does it through a passionate journey called Engagement Studio that allows us to guide the person who left us their email on a path in which we can automate the sending of an email with Pardot, depending on if they’ve clicked or not, what websites they’ve visited, and if they have consumed a specific content. Or, if they are part of a list that has previously been registered through a form. You can create journeys to figure out each interaction and bring your prospect along the best possible path. Engagement Studio offers one of the best functions across Pardot. ABM and Mediation with Pardot Pardot is focused on the B2B environment and, although marketing is always directed to people, Account Based Marketing (ABM) has come to stay. It’s imperative, within B2B strategies, to keep in mind that we are talking about companies and that, independently of who they are, we want to align ourselves with the company’s needs. The union of marketing and sales is one of the cornerstones of Pardot. To achieve it, thanks to automation and the different rules of lead qualification, we can award points (Grading and Scoring) to our prospects that, with the integration of Pardot with Salesforce, are then moved to the commercial department already qualified (MQL; Marketing Qualified Lead) and are ready to be converted into clients. From marketing, we must clearly outline the rules to define when a lead is qualified and when to pass them to sales. Therefore, we avoid fruitless efforts on the commercial side. If marketing does their part for the commercial side (MQL), the SQL rate (Sales Qualified Lead) will surely improve. And how do we measure success? With the reports provided by Pardot that explain who has visited your landing page, who filled out the form, who clicked on links from your email, or the steps that a prospect took from when they were just an IP address until they gave us their email and started browsing our site. If you go to the “Reports” tab and look for the “Lifecycle” report, you’ll be able to see absolutely everything about the conversion in Pardot. In addition to Pardot’s reports, Salesforce also provides us with reports and panels that give a complete and necessary vision of the process. Pardot and Salesforce are the ideal combination to ensure the optimal tracking of a client’s behavior. The advantages of using Pardot with Salesforce The key advantage to using Pardot is marketing process automation, which saves the time and effort of the team when creating, executing, and measuring successful campaigns. But there are others that are just as important: Personalization: the high level of participation permitted by Pardot allows us to create more solid relationships with prospects and interact with them through dynamic campaigns that are adapted to the moment in the brand relationship. We can better understand the client experience and perfect all the steps of the process that go from marketing to sales. Pardot realizes client tracking in each moment of the funnel and presents adjusted content at this moment in a dynamic way; it shows you what it is doing and when. Lead quality: frustration with leads is a constant point of contention between marketing and sales. Pardot will help you create a better relationship between the teams, given that the prospects generated are the right ones. Through Scoring and Grading techniques, we can ensure that we are classifying leads according to their awareness for and interest in the brand or product. And with this score, we can deliver leads to sales at the ideal time. Acceleration of sales: this advantage is a direct consequence of the two previous points. Managing the opportunities is the priority, and Pardot highly values classification and prospect grading. With automatic grading, we can ensure that the leads that we pass on to sales are prepared, and we can even receive real time alerts on our phone about the leads, if we so desire. Improve the ROI: obtaining insights of the true return on investment of our marketing campaigns is possible. Tracking allows us to detect and increase the investment in campaigns that have worked well.

Sales Marketing,"Pardot Best Practices: 7 Essential Features to Use Implementing the most efficient practices, will not only save you time but maximise the productivity of your team. In this blog I will share a brief overview of the top Pardot best practices and 7 essential features to use. Hollie Fitzpatrick Hollie Fitzpatrick 8 mins Pardot Best Practices: 7 Essential Features to Use Share This blog was written before Pardot was renamed to Marketing Cloud Account Engagement. You can read more about the name change and what it means here. Despite there being multiple ways you can use automation software, when we say Pardot best practices’ we simply mean, using Pardot in the most effective way to streamline activities and automation, in order to produce the best results. As an award-winning consulting company (yes - that is a humble brag!), we push clients to do everything through best practice - from conducting regular account audits, keeping your Pardot account tidy, and much more! Why is following Pardot best practices important? Implementing the most efficient practices, will not only save you time but maximise the productivity of your team - it honestly makes a big difference! Today I will share a brief overview of the top Pardot best practices (in our opinion) used at MarCloud Consulting everyday to maximise our clients marketing automation experience. Overview of the top Pardot best practices: Enable Connected Users Turn on Connected Campaigns Create a Lead Scoring and Grading Model Comprehensive Folder Hierarchy Create Page Actions and Use Them with Scoring Categories Upgrade to Handlebars Merge Language Utilise All Available Features within Email Builder Infographic showing Pardot best practices 1. Enable Connected Users By syncing users between Pardot and Salesforce, it allows for a seamless transition between the two instances, with the added benefit of better management and security for users. There are numerous benefits to having connected users turned on. The key one is, you will only have to create users in one place. Therefore, you will no longer have to create users in Salesforce, and then in Pardot - removing yet another manual process! This can be done by manually mapping users and setting up Single Sign-On (SSO). Users will then have one login that will allow them to have access to both systems - hence a seamless transition from going between the two. Enabling this feature is actually very important as by Spring ’21, Pardot-only user login will be retired and access into Pardot will be exclusively through Salesforce. If you are worried about additional costs… Pardot will be distributing 100 Salesforce Identity Licenses which can be issued to users in place of a full Sales or Service Cloud License - at no additional cost. Click here to learn more about how to map Salesforce users to Pardot. 2. Turn On Connected Campaigns By connecting Salesforce and Pardot Campaigns, campaign data is easily accessed and beneficial to both Marketing and Sales users. The main reason we recommend setting this up is that we are aligning reporting across both systems. Once this feature is turned on, Campaigns are created in Salesforce and automatically populated in Pardot. This also ties in nicely with having a comprehensive Campaign Hierarchy in place. The campaign hierarchy shows Campaigns that are associated with one another via the Parent Campaign field. One key consideration is, each Campaign can have only one parent Campaign, but an unlimited number of sibling Campaigns and a Campaign hierarchy can contain a maximum of five levels. By adopting Parent/Child Campaign hierarchies in your account, users are able to drill down and view the metrics of individual Campaigns (child) in addition to displaying the summary on the Parent Campaign. As a result, Connected Campaigns allows for a new visibility into reporting on how marketing initiatives are performing, evaluating the impact of each touchpoint through multi-touch attribution. Additionally, we can use this to pull data into the B2B Marketing Analytics app to create granular reports based on Salesforce and Pardot Campaigns. For more information regarding Campaign reporting & Multi-Touch Attribution, click here! 3. Create A Lead Scoring & Grading Model This feature allows prospects to be scored based on their activities with your company and paired with prospect grading (how interested we are in the prospect). It is an important tool that determines which prospects are “sales-ready”. Using a blended Pardot lead scoring and grading strategy combines both aspects to determine how prospects move through the sales funnel and qualify as a marketing qualified lead’ (MQL). Note: We recommend ensuring that your Marketing & Sales teams are aligned with deciding at what score and grade a prospect will be to qualify as an MQL and be sales-ready e.g. do prospects need to reach a score of 100 and a grade of B+ before they are passed to the sales team. Overall, this is best practice in order to maximise sales potential and effectively contact prospective customers with relevant products/services that they are looking for and enhance ROI. For more info on Scoring and Grading, check out our Scoring and Grading Handbook for marketers. 4. Have a Comprehensive Folder Hierarchy in Place (and set up Scoring Categories if Pardot Plus Edition) To be brief, folders are an organisational feature and not many really reap the benefits that folders provide. With the countless marketing assets used in your company (forms, email templates, whitepaper documents etc…), combining relevant information into specific folders allows a structure to take form. Screenshot of creating a comprehensive folder hierarchy Please note you can only have 10,000 items in a folder, and 16 levels of subfolders. If you are a Pardot Plus account user, you will be able to utilise Scoring Categories in your folder hierarchy. By enabling Scoring Categories through Pardot’s Folder hierarchy, we are able to collectively group prospects based on different forms of engagement, illustrated by an overall score and score on each subgroup (areas of engagement). For more information on how using Folders in Pardot can enhance your marketing automation journey, please click here. Watch this video to learn how to organise your Folder Hierarchy 5. Create Page Actions & Use Page Actions with Scoring Categories Page actions are simply actions that are generated when a prospect views a specific page on your website. Every time a prospect views a page that you have listed as a Page Action’ it shows in their Prospect Activity’ section on their prospect record. This is a powerful feature to utlise as we are able to pinpoint what interests the prospect and the stage of the buying journey they are currently at. This in turn allows us to market to them effectively and efficiently! This is a key Pardot best practice in itself, however this can be explored further with the use of Scoring Categories. Essentially, Scoring Categories refer to a prospect’s engagement with your business, how many points have been accumulated, shown through an overall score or subcategories based on certain activities. When used in conjunction, this feature can add or reduce a prospect’s score in Pardot, dependent on the score allocated to certain pages. By utilising this, we are able to segment different prospects for lead qualification. For more information, we have a really helpful blog that explains how Pardot Scoring Categories Lead To Better Segmentation. Additionally, we can set up completion actions off the back of a page view. Screenshot of how to create a page action For example, we could use the Completion Action Notify user’, to inform a Sales rep that a prospect has visited the pricing page on the website. By using completion actions, the sales team can be automatically notified which allows them to act quickly whilst that prospect is engaging. 6. Upgrade to Handlebars Merge Language (HML) Originally, we used Pardot Merge Language (PML), using Pardot variable tags to create customised content. As we upgrade to HML we are able to use one shared language between Pardot and Salesforce. There are many key benefits of upgrading, but I will outline a few. HML unlocks conditional logic in email content, to put this simply: HML is utilised to minimise grammatical mistakes in emails through the #IF statement. If the field you require is empty (if we don’t have the recipient's first name), the IF statement will change the sentence so there is not a blank space. For example: Instead of “We’ve got good news for you, !” it will be “We’ve got good news for you!” and is therefore a very important aspect to Pardot email best practice. Another cool feature from HML is the ability for prospects to opt themselves back in directly from a form through the Pardot Resubscribe Process. As a result, we are able to customise the resubscribe prompt message and help prospects to re-engage with our brand. Most importantly, this feature works hand-in hand with the sales and marketing team alignment. HML means we will now have a more standardised language between Pardot and Salesforce, the tags are compatible between the two systems, allowing for a unified structure. This feature may already be turned on but if not… all you have to do is click on the Get Started’ button as displayed below: Screenshot of the get started button feature And click Upgrade to HML’ (remember, this is irreversible). If you would like to read more, my colleague Jake has written a blog that outlines all the features of Why You Should Use Handlebars Merge Language (HML) for Pardot. 7. Utilise All Available Features within Email Builder The list of Pardot email marketing best practices ranges from technical, to analytic, to design. One of the most underrated Pardot email marketing features is the ability to personalise content through dynamic content and variable tags. Dynamic content allows us to deliver different variations within one email to prospects based on criteria we determine. We encourage clients to personalise their content to align with their buyer personas they have set up within Grading Profiles. By engaging with this design strategy, the recipient's email experience is magnified for a targeted effect. As previously mentioned, pinpointing where the prospect is in their buying journey can allow us to send relevant content and to finish it off, a clear call to action to encourage conversions. Similarly to content, the design will have to follow the same structure, ensuring key points are clearly communicated in an engaging fashion to avoid skimming or deletion! An exciting announcement: And to end on a high note… As part of the Winter ’21 Release, Pardot is releasing a user-friendly alternative to the current email builder, specially designed for Lightning. As detailed by our Pardot Specialist Hannah, the new Pardot design feature: The New Drag-and-Drop Pardot Email Builder lets you drag email components onto your email template where you want, with ease. One of the features of the new Drag-and-Drop Email Builder is the ability to store and take images from Salesforce CMS, therefore having all image content stored in one place. Enabling CMS (Content Management System) allows you to create, manage and share content across multiple channels into the new email builder in Pardot. Salesforce CMS is available as an app in Lightning Experience. Made to include all Pardot editions, this is a great feature to get excited about!

Sales Marketing,"6 Advanced Pardot Form Features You Should Be Using By Jennifer Contino November 11, 2022 With many features on offer, you could be overlooking the best that Pardot forms offer. We often get stuck in the everyday, quick turn, marketing automation rut, and forget there’s more to explore. Whether you’re new to Pardot, or a seasoned user, we recommend you check out these advanced features to spice up your forms. This guide will cover the following Pardot form features: Progressive Profiling Pardot Dependent Fields Kiosk/Data Entry Mode Include the ‘Not You?’ Link reCAPTCHA Personalized Thank You Content READ MORE: Pardot Forms: 12 Things You Should Know 1. Progressive Profiling When a prospect returns to a form, only form fields that the prospect has not previously completed will be shown (that’s unless the field has the “Always display even if previously completed” setting enabled). If you’re running recurring events such as monthly webinars, meaning that prospects are coming back to register over and over, it’s likely that they will just see the email field. Enter Progressive Profiling, enabling you to display forms field based on what data the prospect has already completed previously. For example, if we already know a prospect’s job title, the next time they return to the form, we can ask which marketing automation platform they’re using. This is how the example above looks in Pardot. The purple box indicates the fields they will see initially. Once the prospect has completed their job title, the field highlighted orange will display: Note that there’s a (c) next to the field name, which stands for “conditional”. To set up Progressive Profiling in Pardot: Click to edit the field you want to make conditional. Go to the Progressive tab, and add the fields that need to be first completed before this field is displayed. Progressive Profiling is really helpful in enabling you to collect more data from prospects as they continue to engage with you via form submissions – you’re more likely to get a higher form conversion rate because you’re not bombarding the prospect with a long form to complete. READ MORE: Pardot Progressive Profiling Form Tutorial & Examples 2. Pardot Dependent Fields If you need related information about a prospect when they select a particular field value, use Dependent Fields in Pardot to capture that data point from only the relevant prospects. Perhaps a prospect is indicating that they’re using Pardot as their current marketing automation platform, and you would like to know how long they’ve been using it, set up a dependent field. On the other hand, if they select “Hubspot” then you’re not interested in how long they’ve been using it. To set up Dependent Fields in Pardot: Click to edit the field you want to control the dependent field (i.e. “Current marketing automation platform”). Go to the Dependent tab, and check “Display other fields in this form based on the value of this field”. Fill in the “When this field equals” and “Show this field” (i.e. When “Current marketing automation platform” equals “Pardot”, show “Pardot Experience”) Note that there’s a (d) next to the field name, which stands for “dependent”. Pardot dependent fields are useful for ensuring that the prospect can be routed to the correct assigned user, if your lead assignment rules contain multiple different fields. 3. Kiosk/Data Entry Mode Kiosk mode is a Pardot form setting that stops a Pardot tracking cookie being placed on your browser when you submit a form. With Kiosk Mode enabled, no one gets cookied. Why would you want this to be prevented? The most common use case for Kiosk Mode is for devices set up at events to capture data from multiple prospects. You don’t want any activity on the device to be associated with the most recent prospect that submitted the form. READ MORE: Pardot Forms: 12 Things You Should Know 4. Include the ‘Not You?’ Link Have you ever been forwarded a link to a form and it displays another person’s information? This can happen when an email with a link to a form is forwarded, or you share devices. That’s where the ‘Not You’ link comes in. When enabled, a small link will appear under the email field. When a prospect clicks this, Pardot clears the data on the form so that the prospect can enter their own information. I always recommend enabling this setting as best practice, otherwise, we will see the wrong data stored on the wrong records in Pardot. To include the ‘Not You?’ link on Pardot forms: Go to the “Look and feel” step, and go to the Advanced tab. Check the “Include “Not you?” link to allow visitors to reset the form” setting.
