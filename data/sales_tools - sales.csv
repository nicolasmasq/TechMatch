1,Sales Marketing,"10 Sizzling Salesforce Summer ’24 Features for Developers

By Andrew Cook
April 23, 2024

The sizzling Salesforce Summer ’24 release is just around the corner! Like sunshine breaking through the clouds, the highly-anticipated release notes are here to illuminate your day. This summery burst of features brings a wave of exciting new additions!

Discover all the details to get ready for your instance’s upgrade, and find your release window here. But for now, let’s dive into the heart of this blooming landscape and explore the most captivating features and updates – crafted specifically for developers – in the Salesforce Summer ‘24 release.
1. Evaluate Dynamic Formulas in Apex (Beta)

In Apex, there’s exciting news: Dynamic formulas can now handle SObjects! With the introduction of the `Formula.builder()` method, you can easily create a FormulaBuilder instance to tailor your formulas as needed.

What’s even better? You can use the `getReferencedFields()` method to fetch a list of field names referenced within a formula. This handy feature streamlines your workflow by providing quick access to the fields your formula interacts with.

Here’s a bonus: While formula evaluation in Apex is constrained by a character limit, there’s no need to worry about hitting the compile size limit. This flexibility allows you to craft complex formulas without being hindered by compile size restrictions.

Let’s take a look at how this might work. Let’s say you want to calculate a potential discount for an Opportunity based on the Opportunity amount and a user-specified discount percentage stored on a custom field.

Opportunity opp = [SELECT Id, Amount, Discount_Percentage__c FROM Opportunity WHERE Id = :someOppId];

// Construct the dynamic formula using Formula.builder()
FormulaBuilder fb = new Formula.builder();
Formula dynamicDiscountFormula = fb
                                 .discount(opp.Amount, opp.Discount_Percentage__c) // Hypothetical 'discount' function
                                 .build();

// Evaluate the formula
Object result = dynamicDiscountFormula.evaluateWith(opp);

// Cast the result (likely a Decimal) and use it as needed
Decimal calculatedDiscount = (Decimal) result;
System.debug('Calculated Discount: ' + calculatedDiscount);

Here is what the above is doing:

    Fetching the Opportunity: We query for the relevant Opportunity record.
    Constructing the Formula:
        We create a FormulaBuilder instance.
        We assume a hypothetical discount function within the FormulaBuilder to calculate the discount based on the amount and percentage (you would likely tailor this to your specific calculation).
        The build() method finalizes the formula.
    Evaluating the Formula:
        The evaluateWith(opp) method executes the formula in the context of the Opportunity, substituting field values.
    Handling the Result:
        We cast the result to a Decimal for further usage.

2. New and Updated Items in Apex

As usual, there are plenty of new and updated Apex items. First up is the Auth namespace which introduces several enhancements, including new classes, methods, and changes to existing ones.

New Classes:

    ExternalClientAppOAuthHandler: This class extends the capabilities of managing external client apps. Key methods include authorize, customAttributes, and refresh for user authorization, attribute setting, and configuring token refresh.
    Auth.HttpCalloutMockUtil: A new utility class facilitating mock HTTP callouts, promoting enhanced test coverage.

New or Changed Methods in Existing Classes:

    Auth.JWT Class: Several methods like getValidityLength, setValidityLength, getNbfClockSkew, and setNbfClockSkew now handle exceptions differently, throwing a NoAccess exception for JWTs generated using Auth.JWTUtil.
    Auth.JWT Class: The getAdditionalClaims method now returns additional claims for JWTs generated using Auth.JWTUtil, with claims formatted as inner lists converted to JSON strings for easier conversion into maps.

In the ConnectApi namespace (also known as Connect in Apex), new classes, methods, and enums are introduced, offering expanded functionalities for REST API resource actions.

In the DataSource namespace, updates focus on mapping external data types to Salesforce external objects via the Apex Connector Framework. New methods like currency, date, email, percent, and phone in the Column class enable the creation of new columns on a DataSource.Table.

Under the System namespace, notable additions include Apex cursors for traversing large result sets, instantiation of FormulaBuilder, improved error handling for non-platform event sObjects, and new exceptions for cursor management.

In the FormulaEval namespace (Beta), enhancements include new methods for retrieving referenced field names in formulas and setting context types for formula evaluation.

Lastly, the Enablement namespace (Developer Preview) introduces classes and methods for creating custom items in Enablement programs. Key classes like EnblProgramTaskDefSubCategoryType, LearningItemType, and LearningItemTypeHandler facilitate defining exercise and learning item types, along with providing metadata information for custom learning item types.
3. Updates to SOQL

As with Apex, SOQL has also received some love with plenty of enhancements in the upcoming release that may impact existing code reliant on older errors and functionality.

Changed Error Codes:

The error code `MALFORMED_QUERY` now replaces `D_QUERY_FIILTER_OPERATOR`.

Changed Functionality:

Negative currency values are now permissible in queries, such as:
1

SELECT Name FROM Invoice__c WHERE Balance__c < USD-500

Changed Error Messages:

Below are examples illustrating how error messages have evolved:

Invalid SOQL queries:
1

SELECT Id FROM Account USING everything

    Old: unexpected token: ‘<EOF>’
    New: unexpected token: ‘everything’

Quotes surrounding an unexpected token:
1
2
3
4

ELECT annualrevenue , parentid FROM Account
WHERE (isDeleted = false AND NumberOfEmployees != 100)
OR (isDeleted = false AND Site = '999')
AND ParentId = '000000000000000' LIMIT 50000 OFFSET 0

    Old: unexpected token: AND
    New: unexpected token: ‘AND’

Using NULL literals in WHERE statements:
1
2

SELECT Id, Name, Country__c, State__c, City__c, PAN_Number__c
FROM Account WHERE PAN_Number__c like NULL AND Name LIKE '%a%'

    Old: invalid operator
    New: unexpected token: ‘OR’

More than two nested functions:
1

SELECT convertCurrency(calendar_year(convertTimezone(lastmodifieddate))) FROM account

    Old: expecting a right parentheses, found ‘(’
    New: unexpected token: ‘(’

Invalid datetime literals:
1

SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE SystemModstamp > 2020-12-12t12:12:00-25:00

    Old: line 1:67 mismatched character ‘5’ expecting set ‘0’..’3′
    New: Invalid datetime: 2020-12-12t12:12:00-25:00

Using “WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED” without a proper Apex context setup:
1

SELECT Id FROM Account WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED

    Old: SECURITY_ENFORCED not allowed in this context
    New: rule soqlWithIdentifierClause failed predicate: {this.helper.allowApexSyntax() && this.helper.hasApexContext()}

Be mindful that running SOQL queries against DMOs may consume Data Services credits from your Data Cloud subscription. Ensure caution when utilizing features like ‘FOR’ loops, query locators, recursion, or any mechanism resulting in multiple queries to Data Cloud. For comprehensive information on usage billing, refer to the Data Cloud Billable Usage Types documentation.
4. Data Cloud Objects – Now With SOQL!

Static SOQL is now an available option for querying Data Cloud data model objects (DMOs), providing a more direct alternative to using dynamic SOQL or ConnectAPI. This enhancement allows for more efficient and straightforward querying of DMOs. Additionally, starting from API version 61.0, SOQL queries using Apex `Database.QueryLocator` or within `FOR` loops are supported.

Prior to version 61.0, only the first 201 records were returned in such queries. Batch Apex is currently restricted from using QueryLocators with DMOs but is supported when using Iterable. This change applies across all Salesforce editions.

Here’s an example demonstrating the usage of static SOQL with the `UnifiedIndividual__dlm` Data Cloud object:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12

// Static SOQL example
List<UnifiedIndividual__dlm> unifiedIndividuals = [
    SELECT
        Id,
        ssot__FirstName__c,
        ssot__LastName__c,
        ssot__Email__c,
        ssot__SkyMilesBalance__c,
        ssot__MedallionStatus__c
    FROM UnifiedIndividual__dlm
    WHERE ssot__CompanyId__c = :companyId
];

However, it’s crucial to note that running SOQL queries against DMOs can consume Data Services credits from your Data Cloud subscription. Ensure caution when utilizing features like `FOR` loops, query locators, recursion, or any mechanism resulting in multiple queries to Data Cloud. For comprehensive information on usage billing, refer to the Data Cloud Billable Usage Types documentation.
5. Scratch Org Snapshots for Efficient Configuration in Salesforce – Now GA

We highlighted this feature going into beta in the Spring ‘24 release. Well, that beta seemed to go pretty well as this feature is now being made generally available!

Scratch Org Snapshots allow users to capture a snapshot of a scratch org’s configuration at a specific moment in time. This snapshot can then be used to replicate the same configuration in other scratch orgs, streamlining the process of reproducing specific setups.

Scratch Org Snapshots are available in both Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic, across Developer, Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited editions. To access this feature, the Dev Hub org needs to be upgraded to the Spring ’24 release.

This feature simplifies the traditionally manual and time-consuming process of setting up scratch orgs with project dependencies. Users can activate Scratch Org Snapshots in their Dev Hub org, and Salesforce CLI commands such as “org create snapshot” and “org list snapshot” can be used to manage and create snapshots.

Ultimately, Scratch Org Snapshots boost efficiency by facilitating the rapid replication of scratch orgs with specific project dependencies, reducing the need for repetitive manual configurations.
6. Run Flows in Bot User Context – Enforced

With this update turned on, when a bot starts a process, it uses the user profile and permission sets linked to the bot to decide what data it can access and change.

Before this update, processes started by a bot worked in system mode, giving them permission to access and change any data.

Now, processes are started by a bot work in user mode. When a bot starts a process, the permissions linked to the bot and any sharing rules determine what data the process can access and change.

For instance, let’s say the bot triggers the Update Account Type process:
1

POST /v54.0/actions/custom/flow/Update_Account_Type

This update enhances security in Salesforce by preventing bots from accidentally creating or changing records they shouldn’t.
7. Allow Only Trusted Cross-Org Redirections – Enforced

To safeguard your users and network, ensure that you include the specific Salesforce org URLs you trust in the Trusted URLs for Redirects allowlist. Without being on this list, users won’t be able to navigate to a different Salesforce org, including its publicly accessible pages and content, from your org.

Any redirections to other Salesforce orgs will be restricted unless the URL is listed in the Trusted URLs for Redirects allowlist. Essentially, users won’t be able to reach a different Salesforce org’s content from your org unless the URL is deemed trustworthy.

This measure aims to protect users from potential security threats, permitting links, actions, or processes to direct users to another Salesforce org only if the target URL is trusted.

This change specifically affects situations where users are directed to a different Salesforce org, such as when clicking a link to an Experience Cloud site hosted in another Salesforce org. Once this update is enforced, such redirections will be permanently blocked.

The following types of URLs are most commonly impacted:

    Hard-coded links leading to a different org, like a link pointing to a production URL in a sandbox environment.
    Processes that guide users to another org, such as a workflow in production directing users to a sandbox to perform a task.
    Links redirecting users to another production org, especially relevant if you manage multiple production orgs.

Notably, this change doesn’t affect access to URLs within the same org with different domains, such as links from a Lightning page to a file. Users will always be able to access URLs within the org where they are logged in.

8. Enable EmailSimple Invocable Action to Respect Organization-Wide Profile Settings

With this update activated, the EmailSimple invocable action follows the email address profile settings set at the organization level.

Once enabled, any usage of the EmailSimple invocable action will comply with the organization-wide email address profile settings.

Previously ignored, the profile restrictions within your organization-wide email address settings now take effect.

Any features utilizing EmailSimple for organization-wide email addresses will be affected if they’re executed within a user context and the user’s profile doesn’t align.
9. Lightning Component Updates

Updates to Lightning Components are aplenty in this release. Below are some of these updates, along with some recommendations on how you may want to address them:
Lightning Web Components (LWC)

    Accessibility Enhancements: Many LWC components (combobox, datatable, helptext, input, progress-indicator, etc.) have improved keyboard navigation, error handling, assistive text, and ARIA attributes for a more inclusive user experience.
    New Attributes: Gain more control over component behavior with new attributes like:
        aria-describedby and aria-labelledby (select, textarea) for better accessibility
        date-access-key and time-access-key (input type=”datetime”) for keyboard shortcuts
        show-compact-address, subpremise, subpremise-label, and subpremise-placeholder (input-address) for refined address form layouts.
    Dynamic Data Loading (lightning-tree): Improve the performance of large trees by loading data dynamically as tree nodes are expanded.
    Module Updates:
        lightning/analyticsWaveApi: New functions to manage CRM Analytics folders.
        lightning/platformUtilityBarApi (Beta): Control utility bar elements programmatically.
        lightning/platformWorkspaceApi: Enhanced compatibility and no longer requires Lightning Web Security pre-activation.
        experience/mobilePublisherConfigApi (Beta): New wire adapter to manage mobile publisher navigation.

Aura Components

    lightning:InputAddress: Offers more flexible address input formats with new attributes (showCompactAddress, subpremise, subpremiseLabel, and subpremisePlaceholder).

Based on these updates, we recommend developers review their custom Lightning Web Components (LWC) and Aura components to assess how they can leverage the accessibility changes and new attributes introduced in recent updates. For applications dealing with large tree structures, adopting the lightning-tree component with dynamic data loading capabilities can significantly enhance performance and user experience.

Additionally, exploring the latest module updates for Lightning Web Components (LWC) offers opportunities to extend functionality and improve development efficiency by incorporating new features and enhancements into applications.
10. Streaming API Retirement

If you are using Streaming API versions 23.0 through 36.0, this is an important update. These API versions are scheduled for retirement in the Winter ’25 release. These versions are now deprecated and will no longer receive official support.

It’s essential to recognize the significance of this update for several reasons. Firstly, sticking with older versions means missing out on the latest enhancements and bug fixes, which could impact the performance and stability of your application.

Secondly, as Salesforce continues to evolve, these legacy versions may encounter compatibility issues, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior or integration breakdowns. Therefore, action is required to ensure the continued efficiency and reliability of your Salesforce environment.

If your applications are currently dependent on any of the retiring Streaming API versions, it’s imperative to promptly upgrade to a supported version. This urgency stems from three key factors:

    Newer API versions (37.0 and above) provide improved features, bug fixes, and overall reliability, contributing to enhanced stability and performance.
    Ensuring your integrations remain functional is crucial for long-term compatibility, safeguarding against disruptions as Salesforce progresses.
    By transitioning to Durable Streaming, introduced in version 37.0, you can capitalize on advanced event replay capabilities and enhanced fault tolerance, further fortifying your system’s resilience.

2,Sales Marketing,"5 Insights from the “State of Salesforce” 2023-24 Report

By Ben McCarthy
September 14, 2023
Branded content with IBM

IBM’s “State of Salesforce” report is back, and perfectly timed to provide an extra layer of context for all the exciting Dreamforce news coming out this week.

The report, which has been running since 2011, is the largest of its kind, providing valuable insights into the most successful Salesforce implementations.
The State of Salesforce

Since the release of the last 2022-23 IBM report, it’s been a bit of a whirlwind – and not the fun kind. Words such as downturn, inflation, layoffs, and recession have plagued our channels since the end of 2021, and Salesforce has been no exception to this.

But there is a very bright light at the end of the tunnel, and that light is coming to us in the form of artificial intelligence. With the insane adoption of generative AI apps, and many industry thought leaders such as Bill Gates and Marc Benioff predicting that this new wave of technology will be unlike anything we have ever seen, could we be experiencing a new industrial revolution?

Inside this year’s report, readers will find the results of the IBM research team speaking to 3,459 executives involved in Salesforce implementations. The report also contains a lot of data comparing the “pioneer” organizations, those who are embracing AI and change, versus the “pensive” who have yet to fully complete their digital transformation.

Let’s dive into the current state of Salesforce for 2023-24, and some of the top trends that will affect all Salesforce professionals.
Insight 1: Shape the Future of Generative AI

Artificial intelligence: hype or the real thing? A natural question to ask when a new “game-changing” technology arrives on the scene. After all, some might still be reeling from the buzz around cryptocurrency and NFT’s.

But artificial intelligence is different. Never in my 11 years in the Salesforce ecosystem have I seen Salesforce professionals, the wider tech ecosystem, and company executives get so excited over a technology. Let me share a few key findings from the report…

    75% of CEOs believe competitive advantage will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI.
    50% of CEOs are now integrating generative AI into products and services.
    43% are using generative AI to inform their strategic decisions.
    Generative AI sales budgets are expected to triple by 2025, with marketing and service budgets expected to more than double.

Most people hadn’t even heard of generative AI until less than a year ago, so I find these results pretty incredible.

One big separation from the companies IBM identified as “pioneers” versus “pensives” in this space, is how they are approaching generative AI. Pioneers are already experimenting with AI, trying to find use cases that can increase profitability, and free up their employees to focus on higher value customer tasks. They are also expanding the potential remit of generative AI, that could be used across customer service, sales, and marketing.

Pensive companies, alternatively, are cautiously focussed on internal use cases. Part of this cautiousness could be due to the “Trust Gap” that Salesforce has identified, which they have already set out to solve with the AI Cloud.
READ MORE: IBM and Salesforce Team Up To Help Businesses Accelerate Adoption of Trustworthy AI

If, after reading this insight, you feel that your company may be falling behind the curve when it comes to experimenting with AI, there are two major areas to focus on:

    Experiment: Whether this is upskilling yourself as a professional, or working alongside your business to get a headstart on potential projects, experimenting is the way to do it. Of course theory is important too, but with widely accessible generative AI platforms available, it’s time to get to grips with the potential.
    Think holistically: Don’t restrict yourself to improving the current state of operations, and think beyond simply helping your employees generate some text. We are still at the very early stages of AI, and anything is possible.

Just in case any extra motivation is needed to get started, pioneers expect nearly 15% of their workforce will be augmented with generative AI tools within the next year as more employees are trained and gain hands-on experience.

Insight 2: Gain Altitude With Industry Clouds

It was around 2015 when I first heard of verticalization within Salesforce the company – that is, ensuring every touch point from sales teams, to product, and the implementation partner had an industry focus and specialization.

This had a couple of main benefits. Firstly, the customer was surrounded by Salesforce experts that understood their industry, and spoke their language – acronyms and all. Secondly, it allowed the customer to get value out of their implementation faster. So it’s no real surprise to see IBM identify Industry Clouds as top trend for 2023-24.

Why are they so impactful? Simple. Industry Clouds allow Salesforce customers to adopt specific, customer-centric solutions tailored for their industry.

The reason this trend has been included, is due to the ROI and impact that pioneering organizations see when they implement Salesforce Industries. IBM has identified that pioneers see 150% more ROI than pensives. Pioneers are also more bullish on industry solutions in general, and are implementing customer experience with Industry Cloud capabilities 56% more than pensives.

In addition, an encouraging statistic to come out of the report is that pioneering companies make up 14-24% of every industry, meaning that all organizations can take advantage of industry solutions.

Insight 3: Integrate Data to Dismantle Siloes

Remember when big data was the hot topic as organizations tried to work out how to deal with the immense amount of data they are generating? Well, we have come full circle.

Data might not be the hot topic anymore, or be as interesting to talk about as artificial intelligence, but it is fundamental in everything we do as Salesforce professionals – especially in the age of AI.

IBM’s third insight, in my opinion, is imperative to all businesses’ future success. In last year’s report, IBM identified Salesforce multi-cloud as an important trend, but in the 2023-24 report, we need to go beyond just multi-cloud, and ensure that all data from the organization is sitting in a centralized location.

Of course, this means we have to do the basics right, such as ensuring an Account Manager has oversight of the customers implementation and any post-support that is going on. But by having centralized data, it also allows us to overlay AI to generate insights.

The State of Salesforce report shows that pioneers are able to…

    Reveal new opportunities 39% more than pensives.
    Apply AI to generate insights 54% more.
    Identify 28% more unmet customer needs.
    Discover new business models 37% more.

It’s also important to point out that data is the bedrock foundation of which generative AI efforts are laid. If data is sparse, inaccurate, or out of date, your generative AI outputs will be too.
Insight 4: Invest in a Change-Ready Culture

If there’s one thing that’s inevitable in the world of technology, it’s change.

In the Salesforce ecosystem over the past 10 years, we’ve had to support lightning migrations, integrations of marketing automation systems, supporting a remote-first workforce, and now, we need to roll out artificial intelligence.

If there’s a second thing we’ve learned in the world of technology, it’s that the companies that embrace chance and agility are those that reap the rewards, and the data backs this up. Pioneers prioritize higher accuracy in measuring Salesforce ROI so they can adopt more quickly (117% more than pensives) and they are also 89% more likely to adapt their business model.

Pioneers are also 38% more likely than pensives to crowdsource innovation from within. This is especially important for artificial intelligence. Due to the fact that there are only a handful of well-known use cases for AI, it’s time to find out from your ‘boots on the ground’ how AI might be able to help them.

But embracing change and implementing Salesforce isn’t enough, your organization needs to have proper change management in place to ensure that ideas and new technologies turn into cold hard ROI.

Insight 5: Overcome Enterprise Inertia With Innovation

Innovation is something all companies know they need to do, but in reality it can be a challenge. However, as this insight in the report suggests, it’s a sure fire way to overcome a stagnant organization.

Innovation is also the perfect word to summarize all the insights in this year’s report. Any one of these trends will support your organization in becoming ready for changes to the market.

And how do you understand changes in the market, or within your business? The answer is data. Data might as well be the closest thing we have to a crystal ball. Our ability to move in any one of a multitude of directions, with the ability to shift in another quickly as circumstances change, all hinges on our ability to see into the future.

The pioneers in this year’s report are generating an average of 40% more revenue per license – from $2.6M for pensives, to $3.6M for pioneers. This generates a virtuous cycle, they continue to generate strong results that help fund further technology investments, and greater future returns.
Summary

This year’s State of Salesforce report provides valuable insights into how the top performing companies on the planet are already implementing change in the next wave of technology.

There is no doubt that the next few years are going to be extremely exciting for organizations who adopt generative AI, and of course, for those Salesforce professionals who will be implementing it.

One of my favorite parts about this report is that it focuses on the vital and also secondary areas that we will all need to take into consideration when embarking on this new journey. Whilst AI is our favorite new toy at the moment, let’s not forget about data, change management, and adoption as core pillars of any Salesforce implementation.",https://www.salesforceben.com/5-insights-from-the-state-of-salesforce-2023-2024-report/,Salesforce

15 Best Practices in Salesforce that Your Organization Should Follow

Home / Blog / Salesforce / 15 Best Practices in Salesforce that Your Organization Should Follow

During Salesforce implementation, adhering to these practices is crucial for long-term success. From managing clean data to designating a product owner, each step plays a crucial role in user experience. Staying informed about Salesforce platform updates and continually adapting business processes are key aspects to maximize their impact. Additionally, being prepared to report issues and find effective solutions is essential for maintaining system integrity and performance. Whether you are new to Salesforce or a seasoned professional, here are some best practices you should be aware of.

1- Understand Internal Processes

Successful Salesforce implementation requires a deep understanding of internal processes and a well-defined business logic. Before making extensive customizations, it is advisable to clearly prioritize fundamental business needs over superfluous desires, starting with standard Salesforce functions to address immediate needs. This progressive approach avoids unnecessary complexity and facilitates long-term issue resolution.

Additionally, it is crucial to capture detailed requirements by mapping existing workflows and business processes before introducing new features. Technology is utilized most effectively only when processes are fully understood, allowing significant improvements in user experience. Using reason, prioritizing business logic over desires, becomes a key principle for a successful and adaptable implementation as business needs evolve.

2- Keep the Focus on the End User

Salesforce’s fundamental premise is to simplify the lives of end users. To achieve this, it is essential to involve them from the beginning, even before implementation. This active participation creates a sense of ownership among users and facilitates the identification and addressing of potential weaknesses in their experiences. Otherwise, there is a risk of users abandoning the platform, either due to confusion or feelings of neglect.

In this regard, it is crucial to keep users informed about changes and updates as well as seeking their input at various stages while prioritizing their needs. This approach ensures the design of a platform that not only adapts to business requirements, but also generates optimal results by actively considering user feedback.

Additionally, don’t forget to optimize Salesforce for mobile devices as a key element to enhance team efficiency by utilizing Salesforce Mobile and responsive designs in platform customization. This consideration of mobile usability and adapting the interface to various screen sizes not only improves productivity, but also allows accessibility to Salesforce information from any location.

3- Appoint a Product Owner

Many organizations have established effective Salesforce management through a designated product owner, also referred to as an administrator or project manager. This individual, whether an internal employee or an external administrator, serves as the point of contact for questions, issues, and update requests. The product owner becomes an invaluable resource for your team, providing direct assistance and facilitating efficient communication regarding Salesforce usage. It’s worth noting that new Salesforce users can turn to managed service teams to get started before hiring someone internally.

4- Select the Ideal Salesforce Consulting Partner

Having a partner for configuration, development, implementation, and support throughout your Salesforce journey is invaluable. Certified experts can advise on the initial setup, using best practices to support ongoing success. They assist in making informed decisions on customizations, focusing on essential functions, and maintaining system usability.

Additionally, your partner will be available for continuous support and training, handling improvements, user issues, errors, and new requirements as they arise. Their consistent experience and assistance are key elements to maximize the effectiveness and adaptability of your use of Salesforce.

5- Prioritize Data Quality

Maintaining data quality is essential for Salesforce efficiency. Neglecting this aspect can lead to incorrect, duplicate, or missing data, resulting in erroneous decision-making. It is recommended to establish effective data hygiene processes, including naming conventions and data selection lists to standardize information. Training users on the importance of maintaining accurate and complete data significantly contributes to this process.

Valuable tools such as duplicate record checks, data cleansing, and quality metrics can help ensure data integrity. While Salesforce may be the sole source of information for your company, without proper data, you won’t be able to fully leverage its potential.

6- Update and Customize

Updating and customizing in Salesforce are essential practices to optimize system performance and assure alignment with changing business requirements. However, it’s crucial to strike a balance, avoiding excessive customization and code that could lead to technical debt for future maintenance and scalability. The recommendation is to opt for out-of-the-box solutions whenever possible, simplifying processes for users and administrators, and facilitating data search and entry.

Moving from simplicity to complexity requires choosing the right resources. Staying informed about Salesforce updates and carefully planning customizations require knowledgeable and skilled resources which are essential to knowing when and what updates will be implemented. To overcome these challenges, having online resources and Salesforce partners that provide guidance when needed becomes a key strategy to maximize the value of Salesforce and ensure its smooth long-term operation.

7- Develop Integration Strategies

Developing a robust integration strategy is crucial to effectively connect Salesforce with other systems in your technological environment. Use APIs and middleware tools to ensure a seamless flow of data between platforms. Interoperability between Salesforce and other business applications enhances information consistency and accessibility. A well-thought-out strategy facilitates real-time data synchronization and avoids redundancies, enabling efficient information flow between systems and thus optimizes data-driven decision-making.

8- Use Automations and AI

The key to optimizing processes in Salesforce is the strategic use of automation tools such as workflows and triggers. This practice not only improves overall efficiency and reduces errors in data, but also frees up time and resources for the team by automating repetitive tasks. It’s essential to identify and plan appropriate tasks for automation to avoid negative impacts on system performance. With tools like Flow Builder, Salesforce provides a robust platform to effectively implement automation, significantly improving organizational operability. With the explosion of AI in CRM, automations have grown exponentially!

9- Establish a Robust Governance Model

Implementing a strong governance model is crucial for efficient Salesforce administration. This model includes change management, usage monitoring, and compliance assurance. Establishing a version control process ensures supervised implementation of updates and changes which can reduce the risk of errors and conflicts. Additionally, maintaining detailed documentation for configurations and customizations allows a clear understanding of the system structure and facilitates future updates. Governance in Salesforce is key to maintaining stability and consistency in the working environment, promoting efficiency, and ensuring security.

10- Perform Continuous Monitoring and Audits

Continuous performance monitoring in Salesforce is crucial for providing an optimal user experience and efficient system operation. Tools like Salesforce Health Check and Analytics facilitate the identification and resolution of potential bottlenecks, allowing proactive adjustments that improve speed and efficiency. This preventive approach not only ensures smooth operation, but also prevents unplanned interruptions, maintaining a Salesforce environment that adapts to evolving business needs.

In addition, conducting random audits allows identifying areas for improvement, optimizing customizations, and removing unused elements which ensures that Salesforce evolves in line with long-term business requirements. Continuous optimization not only improves system performance, but also contributes to business dynamics.

11- Facilitate Collaboration and Communication

Fostering collaboration among users is vital to maximize the utility of Salesforce. Utilize tools like Salesforce Chatter or Slack, among others, that are integrated with Salesforce to facilitate communication. This creates an environment where users can efficiently share ideas, updates, and best practices. Stimulating information exchange within the platform not only strengthens collaboration, but also enhances operational efficiency and data-driven decision-making.

12- Use Sandboxes

Before launching any new functionality or significant changes in the production environment, thorough testing in a sandbox is necessary. This allows identifying and correcting potential issues before affecting real-time operation, thus avoiding unpleasant surprises and ensuring that adjustments proceed as expected. Regular testing of existing functionalities is also important to maintain their operability and proper use by the team.

On the other hand, comprehensive user training is essential for developing their competence in using Salesforce. A well-trained team maximizes the platform’s capabilities and contributes to optimizing its performance. Investing in user training is a key decision to ensure long-term success.

13- Document Everything

After implementing functionalities in Salesforce, it is crucial to maintain the logic supporting decisions and system usage. Develop comprehensive documentation for administrators and end-users, detailing methods, key elements, and specific functions. In addition to serving as a study guide for the team, updated documentation complements testing, which ensures coherence and efficiency.

14- Ensure Data Security

Data security is paramount. Implement measures to establish an effective system for protecting your organization’s sensitive data. For example, use secure passwords, multi-factor authentication, regular backups, IP address filtering, etc. Other measures, such as combining profiles, permission sets, and field-level security, guarantees that each user has access only to the information necessary to fulfill their roles and responsibilities. This strengthens the integrity and confidentiality of data in Salesforce.

15- Establish a Change Management Strategy

Change management in Salesforce is essential for the growth and scalability of your solution. This practice allows the introduction of new features in a prioritized and planned manner, avoiding potential negative impacts on users or overall business operations. It involves selecting a dedicated team, developing strategies for change requests, active involvement of stakeholders, consideration of the impact on users and processes, and the design of training and communication plans. Adopting this practice is crucial to ensure a smooth transition, optimized performance, all while minimizing risks associated with significant changes in Salesforce.

By following these practices, your organization will maximize the advantages of Salesforce and improve productivity, data accuracy, and user satisfaction. Don’t forget to review and adjust them as your business evolves and Salesforce introduces new features.

6,Sales Marketing,"5 Salesforce Features Every Admin Needs in 2024

By Christine Marshall
February 26, 2024

With every release, Salesforce rolls out yet more incredible features and enhancements. As a Salesforce Administrator, it’s your responsibility to stay up to date on these key changes and continuously aim to review and enhance your Salesforce org. It’s not all about you though! Many new fun features can enhance productivity for your users.

In 2024, I predict a continued focus on increasing ROI (return on investment) by optimizing your existing Salesforce setup to include the latest features and enhancements already at your disposal. In this article, I’ve put together my top five features every Salesforce Admin needs in 2024 to stay ahead of the curve and bring your Admin a-game!
1. Permissions

The retirement of permissions on Profiles may have been delayed. However, Salesforce is still moving towards a Permission Set security model, and now is a great time to get ahead of the curve and start planning your migration.

“Hey, #AwesomeAdmins, I wanted to update you on the End of Life of Permission on Profiles. We are no longer going to enforce the Spring ‘26 end-of-life date. However, I still wholeheartedly recommend you operate with a permission set-led security model. All of our investments are very mission set and permission set group focused from a permissions standpoint. In the coming weeks, you will see some updated blog posts from me on the @SalesforceAdmns blog.”

Cheryl Feldman, Salesforce

Salesforce has introduced numerous new features over the past few releases to help you view and analyze your profiles.

When moving from Profiles to Permissions Sets there are plenty of pitfalls to avoid! Check out the article below for 5 important things to avoid.
READ MORE: Moving from Profiles to Permission Sets: 5 Pitfalls to Avoid | Salesforce Ben

Still a bit new to Permission Sets? Not to worry. Andreea has put together lots of tips for you to get you started successfully.

And while we’re at it, you should also swot up on Permission Set Groups which allow you to group Permission Sets.
2. Dashboards

Engage your users and key stakeholders by upgrading your dashboards to incorporate the latest features and enhancements.

You and your users can now create visually stunning and engaging dashboards with images, rich text, and dashboard widgets that are bound to impress your users and key stakeholders. Increased user adoption and engagement!

To get started, click “+ Widget” and select the type of widget to add when editing a dashboard.
READ MORE: Embed Image Widgets in Salesforce Dashboards

You can also add up to five filters (instead of three) from the Spring ‘24.

Save valuable admin time by transferring dashboard ownership. Historically, when the owner of an important dashboard left the company, you had the hassle of cloning and recreating the dashboard. From Winter ‘24, you can transfer ownership of a dashboard and the new owner has complete control of the dashboard.

If a user with multiple dashboards leaves the company, you can also transfer dashboards in bulk!

Don’t forget that dashboards are not just for the Dashboard tab – dashboards can be embedded in other places, such as the Home page, to give users the metrics they need as soon as they log in to Salesforce.
3. Dynamic Forms, Dynamic Actions & Dynamic Related Lists

I’m starting to sound like a broken record – I’ve been advocating for Salesforce’s dynamic product suite for years now! The absence of support for standard objects and mobile may have prevented you from exploring these features but I have good news for you! As promised at Dreamforce ‘22, Salesforce has extended Dynamic Forms to support hundreds of standard objects! Specifically, support has been extended to the majority of LWC-enabled standard objects (Lighting Web Component enabled).

In addition, Dynamic Forms is generally available for mobile as of the Winter ‘24 release.

With Dynamic Forms now readily available on most standard objects and mobile, 2024 could be a good time to assess your existing page needs and have fun re-designing and re-building with Dynamic Forms, Actions, and Lists.

Still unsure if these features are for you? Here are a couple of use cases to spark some inspiration.
Dynamic Forms

Remove the need for multiple page layouts by using a single Dynamic Form and making Fields or Field Components visible to specific users. For example, you could create a Dynamic Form for Cases and display different information to your Support Team and Sales Team.

You can also make Fields and Field Components conditionally visible based on Record Type or a field’s value. A classic example might be to make the Closed Lost Reason field visible only when an Opportunity record is Closed Lost. Or perhaps the Contract Renewal Date field should only appear once an Opportunity is Closed Won. The possibilities are practically limitless…
Dynamic Actions

Do you have any actions that are only applicable to part of a process or a particular group of users? Dynamic Actions can be configured to display based on filters you determine. You could choose to only allow managers to view a “Send Contract” action or hide a “Send Follow-Up Email” action when a Case is closed.
Dynamic Related Lists

Use Dynamic Related Lists to create related lists that are filtered to specific records. For example, Closed Won Opportunities, Open Opportunities, and Open Cases. Name your Dynamic Related Lists to ensure it is clear to your users what records are being presented. In addition, you can configure what fields are displayed and in what order, choose the number of records to display, and also select which actions are available.

Get started now with the following guides:

4. Einstein AI Tools

Stuck on where to start? For now, let me give you some idea of the features available to you and what’s coming soon.

    Einstein Search: Provides users with personalized and predictive search results within the Salesforce platform. Einstein Search uses machine learning algorithms to understand user behavior, preferences, and context to deliver more relevant search results. This helps users find the information they need faster and more efficiently.
    Einstein Lead Scoring: Utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze and predict the likelihood of a lead converting into a sales opportunity or becoming a customer.
    Einstein Opportunity Scoring: Utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze and predict the likelihood of success for sales opportunities.
    Einstein Forecasting: Uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to bring more certainty and visibility to your forecasts.
    Einstein Activity Capture: Allows users to automatically capture and log emails, meetings, and other activities related to customer interactions directly within Salesforce.
    Einstein Case Classification: Automatically categorize and classify support cases submitted by customers.
    Recommended Articles in Flow: Provides personalized self-service support to customers by recommending relevant knowledge articles during their interactions with a Flow.

There are plenty more AI features currently available. Check out Lucy’s article on the 50+ Einstein AI products and tools.

Coming Soon

Einstein for Formulas

Anticipated to be released at the end of February, after the Spring ‘24 release, Einstein for Flow will act as your assistant and explain formulas in formula fields, validation rules, and default values in fields. The assistant will be available when you create a new formula or when you modify an existing one.

Einstein for Flow

Currently in pilot with a group of customers, Einstein for Flow is expected to go GA in Spring ‘24. As an Admin, you’ll describe the Flow you need in natural language. Einstein for Flow will then generate the Flow for you.
Source: Salesforce

Copilot

As a personal assistant, Einstein Copilot will sit in the CRM app and respond instinctively to any user queries. Powered by Prompt Builder, you can create and manage natural language prompts that can be used to interact with Einstein Copilot in the front end. Accessing this tool means all the information being delivered is reliable and accurate, as it is technically being engineered by the admin.

In addition, you can test out how your prompt works in the playground environment, allowing you a space to trial and error your responses!

Prompt Builder

Salesforce Prompt Builder is a new feature in Salesforce that was also announced in the Spring ‘24 release, that lets you create prompts to generate personalized content. These prompts are like short questions you ask Salesforce to make content for you, such as personalized emails, social media posts, or website pages.

Instead of giving users a blank slate like ChatGPT, it uses templates for specific situations, like “Write an introduction email to this customer” or “Write a follow-up email to this case”.

It’s a powerful tool for enhancing customer engagement and sales, but it’s important to use it ethically and ensure the generated content is accurate and non-discriminatory.
READ MORE: Einstein Copilot & Prompt Builder to be Released in February | Salesforce Ben

I expect we’ll see further AI announcements for Admin at TDX, so be sure to check out our coverage of the event to stay up to date on the latest news!
5. Intelligence View & Seller Home

As businesses strive to keep up with customer expectations and stay ahead of their competitors, an engaging and efficient Salesforce interface for sales users becomes increasingly important.

Several new features have been rolled out for sales teams over the past few releases, including Intelligence View and Seller Home. Both features are designed to offer users an easy way to access information and identify tasks to be done and records that need attention.
Intelligence View

Intelligence View for leads, contacts, and accounts is a great way for users to simply and easily identify prospects and customers that need attention. This will save them time, with less need to wade through every record and they can also take action directly from the Lead, Contact, or Account tab. Fewer clicks = happy users.
Seller Home

Seller Home is designed to drive success for your sales team by giving them a complete view of their business. Sales users can get a ton of useful information at a glance including:

    Opportunity overview
    Account overview
    Lead overview
    Contact overview
    Weekly or monthly goals
    Today’s Events
    To-do items
    Recent Records
    Contact suggestions – identified by Einstein from a user’s emails and events

This new dashboard-like home page is the default Home page for the Sales, Sales Console, and Sales Engagement apps. It will appear automatically unless you have customized those pages, in this instance, you can manually enable it from Setup.
Summary

With every release, Salesforce gives us new features and enhancements to explore. As Admins, we should proactively keep up to date with all of these exciting changes to ensure we are following best practices and utilizing Salesforce to get the greatest return on investment.

How to Use Salesforce

Anyone new to Salesforce will know that it has a learning curve, mostly because of how feature-rich this CRM is. Here, we offer a beginner’s guide on how to use Salesforce — including navigating the interface, customizing the platform, and setting up personal preferences.
Table of Contents
Navigating the Salesforce Interface

Let’s get started with Salesforce training basics. Salesforce offers two user interfaces: Salesforce Lightning and Salesforce Classic. When you log in, you’ll arrive on the homepage.

The homepage in Lightning Experience provides a graph of your quarterly sales performance, and it displays an Assistant that documents your to-do list.
Salesforce homepage showing quarterly sales performance and user to-do list
Salesforce’s homepage



In Salesforce Classic, your homepage will show a high-level view of your work, including recently viewed items and your work calendar.

At the top of each Salesforce page are links and tabs that you can use to navigate the platform’s features:
Salesforce page showing highlighted links and tabs
Salesforce homepage navigation



Here’s how to navigate Salesforce:

    Click the Home tab (1) to switch between objects and features. Object homepages offer information on your Salesforce objects, like a list of your accounts.
    You can use the search bar (2) to find records
    Click Admin User (3) to access user-specific customizations from your user profile
    Access the Setup page to customize Salesforce (4). This is only accessible if you have administrator privileges.
    The Help tab (5) gives you access to Salesforce learning and training resources
    The bottom left icon (6) offers you access to the other apps stored in Salesforce
    The More button (7) gives you access to tabs that aren’t visible via the navigation bar

Customizing Salesforce

You can choose which tabs you want to see when you log into Salesforce with Salesforce Classic by simply:

    Entering ‘Customize My Tabs’ in the Quick Find box (if you’re using Improved Setup User Interface). If you’re not using this interface, type ‘Display’ and click on Change My Display.
    Select the app you want to customize from the drop-down Custom Apps menu
    Save changes

You can also customize the related lists that show up on your detail pages. Here’s how you’d customize your pages in Salesforce Classic:

    Enter ‘Customize My’ in the Quick Find Box
    Select Customize My Pages, and then Change My Display
    Select the snapshot you wish to show on the Home Tab (this is available if your home page includes a dashboard)
    For other tabs, select your list and click Add or Remove to add or remove related lists
    Save any changes

Setting Up Personalized Preferences

You can personalize your navigation bar in Lightning Experience. You can add items to the navigation bar or remove or rename them later. To make multiple changes to the navigation bar, simply:

    Select the pencil icon

Salesforce page showing highlighted pencil icon
Salesforce customization



    To rename the items listed in your navigation bar, select the pencil icon next to the item that you wish to rename and make the desired changes
    You can reorder the items in your navigation bar by dragging them
    To delete the items listed, click the x next to each item
    To add more items, click Add More Items. Using the bar, search from all available items or your favorite list

To configure your settings, you can update your personal information like your email, password security question, and the way your tabs and pages are organized via the dashboard.

To do this in Salesforce Classic:

    Click the down arrow positioned next to your name on any Salesforce page. Based on your organization’s settings, click My Settings or Setup in the dropdown menu.
    If you click Setup, select the desired setting from the left-side menu
    Salesforce showing ""My personal information"" and prospective changes listed.
    Salesforce showing ‘My Personal Information’ and prospective changes


    From there, make the desired changes e.g. under personal information, change your time zone, or reset your security token.
    If you click My Settings, look on the left-side menu and click the item you wish to change in order to display its sub-menu. Then select the item you want to change.

Changing personal information with Lightning Experience



Here’s how you’d do this in Lightning Experience:

    Click your image, located at the top of any Salesforce page
    Select Settings
    Click the menu item you want, located on the left-hand menu
    Make changes as required
    Hit Save

Creating Custom Objects, Fields, and Workflows

You can use custom objects to track and store your company’s data. You can create custom objects to facilitate any kind of data — such as contact information, spreadsheet data, or revenue forecasts.

Here’s how to create custom objects in Salesforce’s Lightning Experience:
custom object data shown in Salesforce
Custom object data shown in Salesforce



    Click Create | Custom Object, located at the top right corner of any page in Setup
    Complete the fields for your object
    You can create a custom object tab by selecting the Launch New Custom Tab Wizard
    Save your custom object
    Want to create custom fields for your object in the future? In Object Manager, select Fields & Relationships

To create custom objects in Salesforce’s Classic:

    From Setup, type in “Objects” in the Quick Find box, then click Objects
    Hit New Custom Object
    Follow the Wizard to create the fields you need for your custom object
    Save

How to Create Custom Fields

In Salesforce, you get access to a number of standard files (files that most CRM users need), like company name, contact, and date. However, you might want to capture information beyond those covered by a standard field.

You can do that with custom fields by following these steps:
custom field data shown in Salesforce
Salesforce custom field data



    In your Salesforce org, hit the lightning icon
    Select Setup
    Select Object Manager
    From the Object Manager page, select the object (e.g. Asset) to open details for that object
    Click Fields and Relationships
    Click New

New button highlighted in Salesforce

Now, you’ll want to do the following:

    Choose your data type
    Hit Next
    Fill out the Field Name, description, and input format
    Choose the field’s visibility and editing access
    Hit Next
    Hit Save

You can also create custom workflows to help support your day-to-day work processes and everything involved in them — such as data entry, reports, and users.

    In the in-app launcher, hit Workflows and then click New
    Type in your name
    Select usage (e.g. order entry, promotion, activity, etc)
    Select a sales org
    Enter your description
    Save

Setting Up User Roles and Permissions

Your Salesforce learning wouldn’t be complete if you left this post without knowing how to set up user roles and permissions to provide your team with the access they require.

As you’d expect from a top CRM service, both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience allow you to edit sharing settings using Salesforce’s user role hierarchy.

Users higher up in the hierarchy can view, edit, and report on the data owned or shared with them by users below them in the hierarchy. Simply:

    In the Quick Find box, type in ‘Roles’ and select Roles
    If the Understanding Roles page comes up, click Set Up Roles
    Add a label for the Role. The Role Name field will auto-populate.
    Select who the role will report to
    Select the role’s level of access to contacts, cases, and opportunities
    Click save

Here’s how you’d give your team permission to create, edit, or delete queues in Lightning Experience:

    Enter and select ‘Users’ from the Quick Find box
    Select your chosen user
    From the Permission Set Assignments related list, select Edit Assignments
    To assign a permission set, select it from under Available Permission Sets and select Add. To remove it, select it from the same list and click Remove
    Save any changes

Configuring Page Layouts and Record Types

Here’s how to configure record types and page layouts in the enhanced profile user interface:

    From Setup, enter ‘Profiles’ in the Quick Find Box and select a profile
    In the Find Settings… box, add the name of your desired object, click on it, and then hit Edit
    In the Record Types and Page Layout Assignments section, make any of the changes you need
    Hit Save

This is how you’d do the same in the original profile user interface:

    From Setup, type ‘Profiles’ in the Quick Find Box and select a profile
    Click Edit next to the record you need
    Select your record type from the list of Available Record Types and add it to your Selected Record Types list
    From Default, select a default record type
    Hit Save

Managing Leads and Opportunities

Our guide on how to learn Salesforce wouldn’t be complete without covering how you can use the platform to manage leads and opportunities.

Marketing automation software can increase qualified leads by 451%, and Salesforce shines when it comes to lead management. You can view your lead metrics and update your records from Lead Intelligence View.

Metrics include things like:

    Total leads
    Leads with no activity in the past 30 days
    Overdue leads
    Engaged and contacted leads
    Disqualified leads

To view more on each individual record, just click on the side panel icon next to the record’s name or click the lead name to see more information.

Here’s how you’d edit lead details:

    Click edit
    Select the fields you want to update
    Make and save the changes

To share leads in Professional, Unlimited, Enterprise, Performance, and Developer Edition organizations with other users, roles, or groups, click on Sharing.

Now, to convert qualified leads, here’s what you’d do:

    In a lead record, choose the lead you wish to convert
    Type a name for the account you’re creating
    If you’re using Salesforce Classic and want to update a personal account, overwrite the lead source with the value from the lead
    Choose a contact
    If you’re using Lightning Experience, choose an existing opportunity from the list. If not, enter a name for the one you wish to create
    Convert your lead
    Create a follow-up task if you wish (e.g. how you’d like to nurture the lead going forward)

Using Salesforce Reports and Dashboards

A recent survey highlighted how 47% of data engineers estimated that poor data quality negatively impacts a quarter or more of a company’s revenue.

With Salesforce, you can help stay on top of your data with visual dashboards and custom reports. Users with any role can view and whip up new reports from their accounts.

Salesforce Report Builder is a visual drag-and-drop tool that you can use to create your own reports or edit ones already in your database.

Here’s how to access the Report Builder:

    Click Create – Report via the Analytics Tab or New Report on the Reports tab
    To edit a current report, search for it on the Analytics or Reports tab and select Edit

You can also view real-time visual data on each report or several reports via your dashboards.
How to Build a Dashboard With Salesforce

    Create the Source Reports
    You want to start by creating the source reports with the data you want to show. To do this, click Create > Lightning > Dashboard. Next, name your dashboard.
    Add a Widget
    Add a widget by clicking the + Widget button. Choose your source report for the widget and click Select. Customize how it displays and then hit Add.
    Filter Your Dashboard
    To add a filter to your dashboard, locate the Field dropdown and select a field to filter on. Next, give the filter a display name. Click Add Filter Value to assign values to the filter.
    Control User Rights
    To control who can view the dashboard, click the star icon. You can rename the dashboard — select Under Name and Under Description to do so.

    Hit Select Folder, find the new folder, and then click Select Folder. Under View Dashboard As, choose who can see the dashboard. Click Save.
    Customize Your Dashboard
    To customize your dashboard colors or themes, click the star icon to open Properties. You can choose from 14 color palettes from Dashboard Palette and light or dark themes from Dashboard Theme.

Here’s how to build a dashboard in Salesforce Classic:

    Create the custom reports with the data you want to show
    Hit the Dashboards tab
    Click Go To Dashboard List
    Hit New Dashboard
    Click Save

Conclusion

From setting up your personal preferences to managing your leads, Salesforce has several amazing capabilities that make it a great CRM. With these tips, you’ll be up and running with Salesforce in no time. Want an in-depth look at the platform‘s features?

8,Sales Marketing,"5 Insights from the “State of Salesforce” 2023-24 Report

By Ben McCarthy
September 14, 2023
Branded content with IBM

IBM’s “State of Salesforce” report is back, and perfectly timed to provide an extra layer of context for all the exciting Dreamforce news coming out this week.

The report, which has been running since 2011, is the largest of its kind, providing valuable insights into the most successful Salesforce implementations.
The State of Salesforce

Since the release of the last 2022-23 IBM report, it’s been a bit of a whirlwind – and not the fun kind. Words such as downturn, inflation, layoffs, and recession have plagued our channels since the end of 2021, and Salesforce has been no exception to this.

But there is a very bright light at the end of the tunnel, and that light is coming to us in the form of artificial intelligence. With the insane adoption of generative AI apps, and many industry thought leaders such as Bill Gates and Marc Benioff predicting that this new wave of technology will be unlike anything we have ever seen, could we be experiencing a new industrial revolution?

Inside this year’s report, readers will find the results of the IBM research team speaking to 3,459 executives involved in Salesforce implementations. The report also contains a lot of data comparing the “pioneer” organizations, those who are embracing AI and change, versus the “pensive” who have yet to fully complete their digital transformation.

Let’s dive into the current state of Salesforce for 2023-24, and some of the top trends that will affect all Salesforce professionals.
Insight 1: Shape the Future of Generative AI

Artificial intelligence: hype or the real thing? A natural question to ask when a new “game-changing” technology arrives on the scene. After all, some might still be reeling from the buzz around cryptocurrency and NFT’s.

But artificial intelligence is different. Never in my 11 years in the Salesforce ecosystem have I seen Salesforce professionals, the wider tech ecosystem, and company executives get so excited over a technology. Let me share a few key findings from the report…

    75% of CEOs believe competitive advantage will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI.
    50% of CEOs are now integrating generative AI into products and services.
    43% are using generative AI to inform their strategic decisions.
    Generative AI sales budgets are expected to triple by 2025, with marketing and service budgets expected to more than double.

Most people hadn’t even heard of generative AI until less than a year ago, so I find these results pretty incredible.

One big separation from the companies IBM identified as “pioneers” versus “pensives” in this space, is how they are approaching generative AI. Pioneers are already experimenting with AI, trying to find use cases that can increase profitability, and free up their employees to focus on higher value customer tasks. They are also expanding the potential remit of generative AI, that could be used across customer service, sales, and marketing.

Pensive companies, alternatively, are cautiously focussed on internal use cases. Part of this cautiousness could be due to the “Trust Gap” that Salesforce has identified, which they have already set out to solve with the AI Cloud.
READ MORE: IBM and Salesforce Team Up To Help Businesses Accelerate Adoption of Trustworthy AI

If, after reading this insight, you feel that your company may be falling behind the curve when it comes to experimenting with AI, there are two major areas to focus on:

    Experiment: Whether this is upskilling yourself as a professional, or working alongside your business to get a headstart on potential projects, experimenting is the way to do it. Of course theory is important too, but with widely accessible generative AI platforms available, it’s time to get to grips with the potential.
    Think holistically: Don’t restrict yourself to improving the current state of operations, and think beyond simply helping your employees generate some text. We are still at the very early stages of AI, and anything is possible.

Just in case any extra motivation is needed to get started, pioneers expect nearly 15% of their workforce will be augmented with generative AI tools within the next year as more employees are trained and gain hands-on experience.

Insight 2: Gain Altitude With Industry Clouds

It was around 2015 when I first heard of verticalization within Salesforce the company – that is, ensuring every touch point from sales teams, to product, and the implementation partner had an industry focus and specialization.

This had a couple of main benefits. Firstly, the customer was surrounded by Salesforce experts that understood their industry, and spoke their language – acronyms and all. Secondly, it allowed the customer to get value out of their implementation faster. So it’s no real surprise to see IBM identify Industry Clouds as top trend for 2023-24.

Why are they so impactful? Simple. Industry Clouds allow Salesforce customers to adopt specific, customer-centric solutions tailored for their industry.

The reason this trend has been included, is due to the ROI and impact that pioneering organizations see when they implement Salesforce Industries. IBM has identified that pioneers see 150% more ROI than pensives. Pioneers are also more bullish on industry solutions in general, and are implementing customer experience with Industry Cloud capabilities 56% more than pensives.

In addition, an encouraging statistic to come out of the report is that pioneering companies make up 14-24% of every industry, meaning that all organizations can take advantage of industry solutions.

Insight 3: Integrate Data to Dismantle Siloes

Remember when big data was the hot topic as organizations tried to work out how to deal with the immense amount of data they are generating? Well, we have come full circle.

Data might not be the hot topic anymore, or be as interesting to talk about as artificial intelligence, but it is fundamental in everything we do as Salesforce professionals – especially in the age of AI.

IBM’s third insight, in my opinion, is imperative to all businesses’ future success. In last year’s report, IBM identified Salesforce multi-cloud as an important trend, but in the 2023-24 report, we need to go beyond just multi-cloud, and ensure that all data from the organization is sitting in a centralized location.

Of course, this means we have to do the basics right, such as ensuring an Account Manager has oversight of the customers implementation and any post-support that is going on. But by having centralized data, it also allows us to overlay AI to generate insights.

The State of Salesforce report shows that pioneers are able to…

    Reveal new opportunities 39% more than pensives.
    Apply AI to generate insights 54% more.
    Identify 28% more unmet customer needs.
    Discover new business models 37% more.

It’s also important to point out that data is the bedrock foundation of which generative AI efforts are laid. If data is sparse, inaccurate, or out of date, your generative AI outputs will be too.
Insight 4: Invest in a Change-Ready Culture

If there’s one thing that’s inevitable in the world of technology, it’s change.

In the Salesforce ecosystem over the past 10 years, we’ve had to support lightning migrations, integrations of marketing automation systems, supporting a remote-first workforce, and now, we need to roll out artificial intelligence.

If there’s a second thing we’ve learned in the world of technology, it’s that the companies that embrace chance and agility are those that reap the rewards, and the data backs this up. Pioneers prioritize higher accuracy in measuring Salesforce ROI so they can adopt more quickly (117% more than pensives) and they are also 89% more likely to adapt their business model.

Pioneers are also 38% more likely than pensives to crowdsource innovation from within. This is especially important for artificial intelligence. Due to the fact that there are only a handful of well-known use cases for AI, it’s time to find out from your ‘boots on the ground’ how AI might be able to help them.

But embracing change and implementing Salesforce isn’t enough, your organization needs to have proper change management in place to ensure that ideas and new technologies turn into cold hard ROI.

Insight 5: Overcome Enterprise Inertia With Innovation

Innovation is something all companies know they need to do, but in reality it can be a challenge. However, as this insight in the report suggests, it’s a sure fire way to overcome a stagnant organization.

Innovation is also the perfect word to summarize all the insights in this year’s report. Any one of these trends will support your organization in becoming ready for changes to the market.

And how do you understand changes in the market, or within your business? The answer is data. Data might as well be the closest thing we have to a crystal ball. Our ability to move in any one of a multitude of directions, with the ability to shift in another quickly as circumstances change, all hinges on our ability to see into the future.

The pioneers in this year’s report are generating an average of 40% more revenue per license – from $2.6M for pensives, to $3.6M for pioneers. This generates a virtuous cycle, they continue to generate strong results that help fund further technology investments, and greater future returns.
Summary

This year’s State of Salesforce report provides valuable insights into how the top performing companies on the planet are already implementing change in the next wave of technology.

There is no doubt that the next few years are going to be extremely exciting for organizations who adopt generative AI, and of course, for those Salesforce professionals who will be implementing it.

One of my favorite parts about this report is that it focuses on the vital and also secondary areas that we will all need to take into consideration when embarking on this new journey. Whilst AI is our favorite new toy at the moment, let’s not forget about data, change management, and adoption as core pillars of any Salesforce implementation.",https://www.salesforceben.com/5-insights-from-the-state-of-salesforce-2023-2024-report/,Salesforce

Based on Microsoft.com, 26% of sales executives still rely on Office 365 (and Excel as a part of it) as a primary sales productivity solution. But it is challenging to log in and maintain all customers’ data there. As a result, sales teams can’t collaborate on it effectively and miss valuable opportunities.

Salesforce, one of the dominant CRM platforms, helps salespeople automate, manage, and monitor sales processes for optimal efficiency. Since 1999, this sales productivity software has delivered significant business improvements to 150,000 customers.

Salesforce helps connect data, and conversation with actions, automate the workforce and mundane tasks and integrate critical systems to unlock new opportunities for better sales.

How Must Does It Cost to Implement Salesforce? True Insight


How to Use Salesforce for Sales: Sales Cloud Best Practices

Sales Cloud is a Salesforce CRM module designed to streamline lead generation for sales teams. The fundamental items of Salesforce organization are Objects. Salespeople often use four standard Objects: Leads, Contacts, Accounts, and Opportunities. And here’s how the whole Objects hierarchy works.


Leads

A Lead in the Sales Cloud is a prospective customer who has shown interest in buying a company’s product. Salesforce Sales Cloud assists in locating leads and works to turn them into clients.


Contacts

If a sales representative qualifies a Lead, they become a Contact. Contacts contain information about key businesspeople involved in a deal.


Accounts

Usually, a Lead isn’t the only person that has initiated the deal, and there may be other individuals associated with the company. And Accounts unify all the Contracts to keep information about these individuals and companies. Further, salespeople can customize and categorize Accounts by the “Type” field in Salesforce based on the needs of the sales: Prospect Accounts, Customer Accounts, or Partner Accounts. Accounts can also represent Opportunities.


Opportunities

Opportunities are deals in progress. And Opportunities remain Opportunities until they are Closed/Won or Closed/Lost.

How to Activate Leads, Contacts, Accounts, and Campaigns in Salesforce Sales Cloud

To enable all the above, follow these steps:

Step 1: Log in to your Salesforce account.

Step 2: Go to products and choose Sales from the drop-down menu. You are prompted to a new window.

Step 3: Choose the Campaign or Lead or Account, or Contact menu depending on what you want to perform.

Step 4: Now click on the new button. A window pops up.

Step 5: Fill out the details and click on the Save button to save the changes made.

What is a Sales Process in Salesforce?

The Salesforce sales process is a sequence of activities from product and market research to the sales close that a sales representative must complete using CRM tools.

The four typical sales process stages are research, prospecting, sales calls, and closes; however, the exact number of steps might vary depending on the industry, product, and sales approach.

How to Create a Sales Process in Salesforce

Salesforce Sales Cloud enables building a perfect sales process powered by top-notch CRM technology. But before you apply it, you need to draft and negotiate with your team. Here are the effective sales process steps sales representatives usually follow:

    Become an expert in the products you are selling to successfully market their functionality, spot potential pitfalls, shorten the sales cycle and manage objections effectively.
    Identify your buyer persona: their demographics, needs, wants, behaviors, and communication priorities.
    Set up prospecting and lead generation.
    Qualify prospects to make sure that your product is a good match for them.
    Analyze and understand the needs of your customers.
    Take time to prepare for the sales call and be ready for objections.
    Present your product as a solution to the prospect’s issues, not just highlight product features on a sales call.
    Follow up with the prospect and send a proposal, reiterate the following steps, and negotiate the deal.
    Nurture the relationship with your customers, cross-sell, and upsell.

Once you agree upon the key elements of a sales process, you need to set up key sales stages in Salesforce for Leads and Opportunities.


Lead Stages vs Opportunity Stages in Salesforce | Ascendix

Lead Stages vs Opportunity Stages in Salesforce

The most common Lead stages look like these:

    Open: The Lead has been created, but a salesperson has yet to communicate with them.
    Nurture: The Lead has shown interest in the product/service but is not yet ready to purchase. They require further nurturing.
    MQL: This means Marketing Qualified Lead, a prospect who has subscribed to mailing (usually via website) and demonstrates a high level of interest.
    Contacted: A sales representative has reached out to the Lead to initiate the qualification process.
    Qualified: A sales rep is in the process of the Lead qualification.
    Converted: The Lead has been turned into a Contact within an Account.

After conversion, it becomes and remains an Opportunity until the deal is either Closed/Won or Closed/Lost.
The Opportunity Stages look a bit different:

    Awareness: The Contact knows about your product or service.
    Interest: A sales representative has interacted with the Contact and sent them educational content like eBooks or whitepapers.
    Consideration: The Contact is comparing you against other product or service providers.
    Decision: The Contact is narrowing down their choices.
    Quote/Negotiation: The Account decision-makers have received a personalized proposal; discussion may occur.
    Closed/Won: The salesperson has succeeded in closing the sale.
    Closed/Lost: The Account chose not to use your company’s service or product.


How to Set Lead Stages in Salesforce

These are the steps that will help you create your Lead Stages in Salesforce:

    Click the Gear icon.
    Click “Edit Object.”
    Click “Fields and Relationships.”
    Click “Lead Status” in the search box.
    Search for the Lead Status Picklist and click “New’.
    Create your New Status based on criteria defined by your team.
    Click “Save.”
    Go back to the “Edit Object” page from Step 2.
    Click “Reorder.”
    Drag and drop your stage names and modify them accordingly.

After you set up sales stages in Salesforce, you need to constantly monitor historical trends to review and improve your pipeline processes.


How to Build a Guided Sales Path in Salesforce

A guided sales path can support and improve your sales process. You can design your strategy based on the signs and activities most likely to indicate closed deals.
Once you build a process, you can recreate it in the CRM by following these steps:

    Move to the required Object.
    Create a New Record Type within the Object for which you would like to create a Path.
    Navigate to Setup and Enable the Path.
    Type “Path” into the search box and select Path Settings.
    Click “Enable.”
    Select “Remember User’s Path Preferences” to ensure that the Path remembers its previous state.
    Select New Path.
    Create the Path and assign it a unique name.
    Select the Object that the Path will be used on.
    Select the Record Type you created and choose the Picklist from the Record Type.
    Click “Next.”
    Choose up to five critical fields for each stage.
    Click “Next.”
    Activate the Path.

Such a sales path can simplify the onboarding of a new sales representative.

    Streamline lead channels.
    Set criteria for lead deduplication and data hygiene.
    Score and prioritize leads.
    Automate the distribution of leads among appropriate sales team members.
    Nurture leads that are not yet ready to buy.

Salesforce Contact Management: Best Practices

Contacts help the sales team keep the information about critical decision-makers and buyers for a Salesforce account. Salespeople need contacts to reach out to the customer or organize demos.

The Salesforce Contact object has a standard set of fields that can be customized based on your needs. Here are the default Salesforce contact fields you can complete when creating a contact:

    First and last name
    Account name

How to Add Custom Fields to the Default Contact Page Layout

The default layout of the contact page is general, so it may need modification to meet your unique needs. For example, you can add several custom fields to make your content page layout more personalized. These custom fields help you add more professional information for the company and keep these records simple.

You can organize your contacts manually, or if you already have contacts in an Excel spreadsheet, you can use the Salesforce Data Import Wizard.

Then, you group contacts in Salesforce in contact lists to meet certain criteria. Besides that, you can quickly build custom list views or a list of contacts created for a certain period of time.

To make contact management in Salesforce effective, salespeople should associate only one person with only one contact record in Salesforce. These records should contain, as many accurate details as possible. And sales agents should update them as soon as any information changes.

Salesblazers from our online community wanted to know how to get sales reps invested in new workflows and tools. And more specifically: “How do we get them to use the customer relationship management (CRM) software?” Fields get unfilled. Data is not up to date. All of this lowers the return on investment on a tool we’re using the valuable budget for! Ashley Mattis, senior director of sales operations and strategy at Groupon, shares her take on this common problem and the broader issue of change management.

Why do you need buy-in from sales reps?

You could have the most beautifully baked-out processes and tools in your customer relationship management platform (CRM), but if reps aren’t using them, you’ve invested in something with zero return. Building trust is crucial, especially at the beginning, because no rollout of any new tool or process is ever perfect. You’ll hit snags or unanticipated bugs. These early challenges require lots and lots of patience from your team while they get resolved.

If your teams aren’t bought in on the bigger picture, they’ll have zero tolerance for when things inevitably go wrong – big or small. You’ll miss whatever goal you were originally working toward. And the sales operations team would have spent weeks and months rolling out a new process for a CRM that’s ultimately rejected. Buy-in helps you avoid all of that tension and makes sure reps adopt new processes as you introduce new tools into their workflow.

    You have to start at the top to be effective at the bottom, and nothing beats finding the right person to deliver a message.

How do you get sales reps to use new tools and processes, like a CRM?

Recruit a pit crew. They’re a mix of sales reps from across different levels and verticals, a representation of people with more tenure and those who are quick to adopt technology. This group should be the first to know about upcoming changes and act as your litmus test.

Then recruit people outside of sales operations to lead the pit crew. Bring in product management, engineering, and sales leaders to explain the data behind the decision. This opens you up to feedback early on in the process, which is extremely helpful when choosing between vendors. At Groupon, I used this process to successfully implement everything from contact cadence software to an upgraded user interface (UI).

And when you’re ready to roll out the new process or tool widely? Make sure it comes from the top. Sales ops has little credibility with sales reps because they don’t always understand the scope of your responsibilities. While sales leaders may trust you, the average rep probably won’t. They look to their sales leaders for guidance. Consider bringing in a sales leader to do the initial overview, so that it’s coming from someone to whom reps are accountable. Then, when it’s time for the nuts and bolts, swoop in with data, demos, and visualizations. You have to start at the top to be effective at the bottom. Nothing beats finding the right person to deliver the right message.

    When I first started in this field, there was often a feeling of sales operations versus sales – even though at the end of the day we all had the same goals.
    Ashley Mattis

Sr. Director of Sales Operations and Strategy
Groupon

How do we ensure adoption is successful?

Once you have buy-in, focus on developing training. I structure my sessions similar to a college course. We start off at the 100 level, a light introduction that gives them enough knowledge to complete what they need to do. Then we build up to the 200 and 300 level, sharing more detailed content and training materials to support each stage.

Also, don’t underestimate the benefit of a reward system! You’d be surprised how much participation will rise when you offer something as simple as a certification process. If I give certification saying a rep has mastered a new prospecting cadence, for example, reps feel empowered to engage with the tool more and even train others.

Lastly, don’t forget about the human element of change management. When I first started in this field, there was often a feeling of sales operations versus sales. The sales ops team would try to get the reps to do something, and reps would resist, even though at the end of the day we all had the same goals. To avoid this adversarial dynamic, pull the empathy lever. Spend time getting to know your reps, find out what their pain points are. I instituted a shadowing program with my sales operations team for this very purpose.

Change can be daunting, and many of our businesses had to change over and over again in the past year. With communication, empathy, and data, you can keep your reps invested in adoption and your sales organization functioning as one machine.

The Pros and Cons of Salesforce for Outside Sales Reps

May 16, 2022
pros and cons of Salesforce for Outside Sales Reps


A good sales leader knows how important an effective CRM system is for their sales team. Finding the right CRM tool for your outside sales team’s needs and fully taking advantage of its capabilities can significantly help improve your sales process, streamline activities, and increase revenue.

With so many options in sales CRMs available today, it is important to really take a look at both the good and bad of the different tools to help pinpoint a good fit for your team. One popular tool you may be considering is the Salesforce CRM.

In this article, we evaluate the strength of Salesforce for outside sales teams by breaking down the pros and cons of this CRM option.


Pros of Salesforce:


Top Option in Sales CRM Platforms


Salesforce is the most well-known and widely-used sales CRM in the market, trusted by over 150,000 customers worldwide.


salesforce for outside sales top crm
Salesforce.com is the top CRM by market share. Source: Apps Run the World


Easy-Access Central Location for All Customer Data


Like all CRMs, one of Salesforce’s value-adds is serving as your company’s single source of truth on customer and prospect information. It houses contacts, deals, communication history, firmographic data, purchase history, and more. It offers a robust dashboard packed full of all the most important data that sales leaders and executives need and want. Plus, sales data can easily be shared with and accessed by the marketing and customer service teams as well.


Great Analytics & Reporting Functions


Salesforce puts all this data to use and provides great reporting, analyzing, and sales forecasting capabilities. These functions give sales leaders the ability to glean in-depth insights, spot trends and patterns, and monitor and track sales activity and deals.


Extensive Customization Capabilities


The Salesforce CRM platform offers a ton of sophisticated customization capabilities, including customized Salesforce lead mapping. Sales teams can customize the features of the dashboard and reporting to meet the specific needs of their business.


Immense Ecosystem of Integrations Available


The Salesforce AppExchange houses hundreds of apps that can seamlessly integrate with your Salesforce CRM, provided by a huge network of integration partners and service partners. These integrations can seamlessly share data with Salesforce and give your team a sales software stack that truly meets the needs of your team.


Cons of Salesforce for Field Sales Teams:


Does Not Streamline/Automate Sales Activities


On its own, Salesforce CRM is essentially a data repository. All of that data, the robust dashboard, and the insight it offers is often very valuable for sales teams (especially sales leaders and executives). But, the CRM is not built to really help outside sales reps manage their day-to-day or automate activities like routing, logging activity, or prospecting.


Can Become Too Complicated and Complex


Because Salesforce’s platform is so robust and customizable, it often becomes too complex and cumbersome for sales reps to use. A lack of sales rep adoption is a key reason why deployments of CRMs like Salesforce often fail.


Not As Mobile-Friendly as It Needs to Be for Outside Sales


salesforce for outside sales
The Salesforce mobile app is not particularly mobile-friendly.

The Salesforce mobile app can be especially clunky for sales reps out in the field. Logging activity or adding customer notes from out in the field can end up being somewhat difficult. While out in the field, the CRM can end up wasting some of the time that it is supposed to be saving.


Your Outside Sales Team Needs a Field-Friendly CRM Option


You need a sales CRM for your team and Salesforce is one of the best. But it is important to understand that there is still a large percentage of sales CRM implementation/onboarding projects that fail. This is largely due to the software being used just as a data hub, inspection tool, and a source of  versus a tool to improve the sales process. And when the CRM is for an outside sales team, this adds even another layer to the needs that the tool should be able to meet.

To truly get value out of an investment in Salesforce, it is critical to make sure that your sales reps are logging their activities, notes, and customer updates in a timely and thorough manner. The data coming out of a CRM is only as good as what goes into it. But if they can’t easily do this on the go, it’s not going to happen.

When a CRM creates additional administrative burdens for your outside sales reps, the quality and completeness of your data and insights can be jeopardized. Your reps may be put in a position of having to make a choice between keeping up CRM-related admin work and actually being out in the field selling. Time consuming administrative burdens reduces the opportunity for additional face-to-face time and relationship building.

The best performing outside sales teams are led by executives that, when looking at their sales technology stack, focus on what value each particular tool brings to their outside reps. The simple fact is that if a tool brings value and is easy to use, full adoption quickly follows. With adoption across your entire sales team, you get complete and accurate data, and that data will produce the desired dashboards and insights that is so valuable to the management team.

So, Salesforce is a great CRM in general, but by itself it may not meet the needs of today’s field sales teams. Not if they want to truly optimize their success.

Outside sales reps need a CRM tool that not only manages all of the data but is easy to use in the field, helps to automate activities, makes their day-to-day easier, and helps streamline the sales process. To ensure your team’s success, it will be vital to meet these needs and ensure that all of the necessary data goes into Salesforce cleanly. The best way to do this is to use a mobile app that seamlessly integrates with Salesforce and acts as a sales-friendly front end.

Sales Force: 3 Ways to Organise Your Sales Team
7 min read ·
Listen

Your product is starting to be known, customers are delighted and it seems that they are starting to use it more and more. Now is the time to promote your sales force. The first step in the process is, therefore, to know what the sales force is. Then we will see some examples that will help you sell more.

But where should you start? At this point, it is normal to get stuck and not know how to do it. Imagine the salespeople acting like pirates screaming ""Prepare to board!"", setting out to sell without anything and nobody stopping them.

The reality is quite different. Only a few salespeople are able to take such initiatives and achieve their goals without collateral damage. Many sales managers think that hiring the best sellers and letting them take care of everything is the cure for all their ills. After all, it's the smartest thing to do, right?

However…

According to a study from Exevi in Spain, only one in four companies defines itself as proactive in improving its processes, thanks to a well-documented and structured digital approach. If your idea was to hire a few salespeople to let them sell on their own (like pirates), unfortunately, this is very unlikely to work. Any approach to success will fail without an organizational structure that matches the value chain and culture of your business.
What is sales force: definition and examples.

Sales force is made up of all the people in the company whose function is to respond to demand with an offer. Generally, these are the members of the sales team whose mission is to achieve turnover.

Sales promotion is generally a task managed by the sales team. Sales management is, among other things, responsible for:

    Defining the sales force strategy and objectives
    Creating and implementing the sales plan
    Recruiting, training and paying team members through incentives

Sales management must also monitor and take the necessary measures to achieve the objectives set.

Thanks to technological progress, the control of the sales force (its other name), is now done through commercial software, reporting, and management tools like commercial CRM solutions like efficy CRM.

That being said, today we’ll be looking at three essential ways to manage your sales team.
3 ways to organize your sales team


1) Organization of an isolated, even lonely sales force

This organization is based on the traditional expression ""sell or die"", so popular in the commercial world. Its poor organizational structure has only a few elements:

    Increase in sales skills.
    A range of products to promote and sell.
    A commission structure for each sale made.
    Sometimes an office.

And that's all!


Force de vente isolée

Each salesperson is solely responsible during all phases of the sales process: it is he or she who must generate prospects, qualify them and close the sales.

Do you know what's going on? Without a frame of reference, aggressiveness increases. In addition to the competition in the market with your competitors, competition is invited within the teams themselves.

Take the example of a real estate agent responsible for promoting properties almost alone, he or she publishes offers on Internet, calls prospects by phone, shows them properties in the hope of closing the deal, regardless of the rest of the organization members or their goals. He or she quickly risks being lonely and wanting to crush his or her colleagues.
Advantages of an isolated sales force organization:



    There is no need for individual supervision by team leaders.
    This organization is efficient in short sales cycles, sales processes, where the sale is concluded in one or two calls

Disadvantages of organizing an isolated sales force:



    It creates an aggressive and very competitive environment.
    The company has less control over its brand image in the market. Indeed, it will depend entirely on the style of the salesperson.
    Everyone does it! And yet it is difficult to follow the measurements and the performances.

2) Organization of the sales force production chain

It is a famous organization in the industrial field. It consists in organizing the production processes sequentially to obtain greater efficiency at each stage of the chain.

This can also apply to salespeople to cultivate and refine the treatment of customers during the process. This organization thus divides your external or internal sales force into four different teams:

    Lead generation team. They attract prospects using commercial email templates in which they present the company's products and services. (See here some examples).
    Sales development representatives. They qualify the opportunity and adapt to customer needs, taking into account their decision-making cycle.
    Account managers. They are negotiators, they are the ones who conclude the contracts. Do they call qualified prospects, give demonstrations, respond to objections? One goal, to close the sale by phone or during a physical meeting.
    The team of success managers. The mission of this team is to monitor the level of satisfaction of the different types of customers, in order to increase their lifespan. (LTV for Life Time Value). Another objective is to do up-selling by selling a higher version of the product or even cross-selling by selling options or supplements.

Force de vente par chaîne de montage

This structure in the ""production chain"" allows your teams to specialize in different roles and functions. A dedicated team intervenes at each stage of the sales cycle. The suspects turn into prospects, then into qualified opportunities to finally become new customers. And at each stage, they pass into the hands of a different team.

Having specialized teams, make it is easier to measure the results of each.

You can already start this specialization with only two sales forces.

One is dedicated to prospecting new customers, while the other is dedicated to signing sales. Based on the Pareto rule, “the 80-20 principle”, you will know when to set up new stations within the assembly line. When your salespeople spend more than 20% of their time on a secondary mission, perhaps it is time to create a new specialized sales team.
Advantages of organizing the assembly line:



    Your business activity becomes more predictable and less random.
    You can isolate problems in the sales funnel to resolve them.
    Finally, more specialization is often synonymous with more efficiency.

Disadvantages of the organization of the production chain:



    Dividing the funnel into different steps can increase the moments of friction when moving customers along the funnel.
    Since these are highly specialized teams, a disconnection between these teams and the company's general business objectives is common. Teams would tend to focus on their own results and parameters.

3) Organization of the sales force in capsules or clusters

Tout comme sur la chaîne de montage, l’organisation en capsules se distingue par la constitution d’équipes étroitement unies, dans lesquelles nous retrouvons différents profils, tous ayant le même focus : le client.

For example, a six-person sales capsule can be organized as follows:

    3 representatives from business development,
    2 account managers,
    And a success manager.

Small groups with specific missions are created and each person is responsible for the entire journey of specific customers.


Équipe de vente

The roles are the same as in the organization seen above. Only here, the competition is between the capsules. Each capsule strives to win new customers, applies different sales techniques to close the deal and then dedicates itself to maintaining customer satisfaction.

With the capsules, you get a more modular and flexible structure than with the traditional model. Success is measured by capsule, where each member of the sales force has a broader and holistic view of the business.
Advantages of the sales force capsule organization



    As the capsules operate in solid groups, the members are not only involved in the stage of the process represented by their specialty (prospecting, qualification, signature, customer success) but also in the complete journey of the customer.
    There is often more empathy and better understanding among the members of each capsule. So there is less friction and more communication.
    The capsules are flexible and agile.

Disadvantages of organizing a sales force capsule:



    There are fewer opportunities for sellers to measure themselves and be competitive.
    There is less specialization in each role because each member of the capsule must be able to do everything.

The capsule structure of the sales force is a more refined version of the production chain. It is ideal for start-ups looking to optimize their commercial resources to attack new markets or new business sectors.

When organizing your sales team, you need to achieve two basic goals:

    Maximize the results.
    Create the best culture for your organization.

Always look at your competitors: how do they structure their sales teams? It is not necessary to imitate them, but if they do it in a certain way, it may be interesting to ask why.



In short, to properly structure your sales team with or without hiring a sales manager, you just need to know which organization would yield the best results. For that, don't forget to ask yourself the following questions:

""What kind of team are we? What kind of culture are we trying to create?

The team you create and the way you do it will give you the clues you need to know how your business is doing and where it is going. And if you want to know how to sell to your customers, apply these recommendations and try to see what types of sales would be most effective in your context. It is on this basis that you will create sustainable growth.

Why Salespeople hate Salesforce…and How We Can Help Them Love It
Why Salespeople hate Salesforce…and How We Can Help Them Love It

    Salesforce.com Training Using Salesforce.com

January 2, 2014

Salesforce.com and salespeople are in a love-hate relationship – in that Salesforce.com loves salespeople, but (many) salespeople hate Salesforce.

One of the most common reasons cited by organizations for the failure of their Salesforce.com system is a lack of adoption by the sales team. Data isn’t inputted. Records aren’t kept up to date. And the value of the whole system is subsequently undermined.

So why do so many salespeople take such a disliking to Salesforce.com?

Sean McPheat, MD of MTD Sales Training, believes that the challenge that organizations face is the very nature of the beast itself – sales people love interacting with people, not with Salesforce.com.

“Many sales people would rather make an additional ten calls per day or go out on another two prospect visits than update their records, especially as a lot of their commission is riding on the results that they achieve,” he explains. “Having said that, what the same sales people do not realize is that many of them miss out on following up with prospects, they forget crucial information and then using the data ongoing for marketing and farming purposes is a lot harder with incomplete or worse still, no records.

“’I’m getting bogged down with paperwork and admin when I should be out selling’ is a common complaint I hear all the time from sales people. Whether it’s the forms they need to complete or the entries onto a computer to fulfil a new piece of business or whether it’s entering updates into Salesforce.com, the salesperson at times does not seem to see past their commission check and the activity required to bump their salary up to the levels that they need.”

Helen Rutherford, director at training firm 2e2, agrees that some of it comes down to mindset.

“Sales people don’t like using it because they don’t see how using the system benefits them personally,” she says. “A lot of sales people work in isolation, and get commission for their own actions. If they make a sale it does impact the wider business of course, but sales is a competitive environment and people will generally see a sale as a personal success.

“With this in mind, it’s hard to justify the usefulness of entering information into a system that may enable someone else to capitalize on their hard work, and potentially lose them some commission. The best sales people are those who take pride in their work and have the competitive edge. The knock-on effect of hiring such people is that they’re unlikely to get the best out of Salesforce.com.”

There are other attitudes amongst salespeople that can cause Salesforce.com to come unglued. John Cheney, CEO of Workbooks, for instance, believes that too often Salesforce.com, or any CRM system, for that matter, are viewed by salespeople as “a tool for managers to keep a close eye on their work” rather than a tool that enables them to be more successful. And Matt Garman, group commercial director at dhc, reports having often heard “I’ll get the sales and somebody else can sort that out”. “It is a laziness and unfortunately salespeople are often given more slack than other people in the firm,” he adds.
The damage of a failure

But while salespeople tend to get the blame, other factors also contribute to poor adoption in many cases. These include:

    A lack of IT/systems knowledge – “There are a lot of un-technical sales people out there, or not prepared to admit they don’t get it!” says Garman.
    Projects have been rolled out without consulting the users first – “Salesforce.com Implementation and Training projects fail because the company has decided to invest in a new piece of technology (decision at Board meeting – ‘wouldn’t it be great to have Salesforce.com’) without engaging with the rest of the business.”
    Over-complicated systems – “If they have to go too far out of their way, different logon, different software, etc. then they just won’t use it.

Unfortunately, whatever the reason for poor adoption, the implications of a Salesforce.com Implementation failure can run far and wide. “The primary danger of a Salesforce.com adoption problem is that as a result of the system not being used and data not being inputted as it should, the data is of poor quality, is inaccurate and thus is not a useful tool for management and does not actively help the sales team,” says Cheney. “In cases such as these, Salesforce.com is seen an expensive burden.”

Darron Walton, managing director of De Villiers Walton adds: “In a fast-paced sales environment, hours spent toiling over complex admin processes and pricing structures could mean a missed opportunity or target. Yet when sales and other Salesforce.com users bypass the system or add incorrect information, this can, in turn, contribute to an inaccurate picture of sales performance.”

So how can organizations ensure that Salesforce.com is warmly embraced by its salespeople? We asked a handful of experts for their advice on how to make Salesforce.com and sales the perfect couple.
Communicate clear objectives

“Communicate with your sales people as to why Salesforce.com is important to the company as a whole and to them as individuals,” advises McPheat. “Many salespeople just see Salesforce.com as a way to keep to score and something that marketing use to send out mailings. With proper objectives and a clear vision for the CRM system your sales team can increase their buy in from the word go. You need to sell Salesforce.com system to the sales people! That does not include just a cascade. Telling is not selling! Instead you need to cover the business benefits and also the all-important question that each sales person will want answering ‘What’s in it for me?’
Get buy-in from the sales team

“From experience, the best projects are company-wide decisions with buy in at all levels,” says Garman. “Leaders/directors need to lead and make sure they practice what they preach when it comes to implementation – all too often they make a call and then move on to the next meeting item without seeing it through.”

McPheat adds: “Ask [the sales team] for their input in designing the system from the outset if you can and make it as simple for them to use as possible. The system should be molded around your sales process so at any stage your sales people know and understand where each of their prospects and clients are in the sales cycle. The people that are going to use it should be the ones to help shape what it looks like and to have an important say in what it should and could do.”
Change mindsets by explaining putting Salesforce.com in context for salespeople

“In order for Salesforce.com to work, employee mindsets have to change – however, businesses need to help with this,” says Rutherford. “Salespeople will understand the use of having a single repository of customer information. If such a system leads to happier customers, stronger relationships and, ultimately, more sales then sales teams should buy into it.”
Demonstrate the ROI

“Communicate any ‘wins’ that you have with the system,” recommends McPheat. “Any deals that were won due to its deployment, any potential problems that were avoided or any data that you are now able to analyse and hence have made some process improvements off the back of it. All of these add fuel to the fire and make using Salesforce.com a way of life and a ‘need to do’ rather than a ‘have to do’.”
Listen to feedback from your sales team

“Most businesses are highly dependent on their sales team for the capturing of key data needed to fulfill orders and to invoice, and hence salespeople are the key to successfully implementing Salesforce.com,” explains Cheney. “Listening to their needs and complaints then acting on their feedback is a sure way to encourage the adoption of Salesforce.com. You may find it helpful to liaise directly with a certified Salesforce.com Training provider, as they will be able to help you identify ways to make the software easier to adopt. It’s also worth ‘championing’ those salespeople who do adopt the system and offering them incentives.”
Ensure the management set an example

“Your sales directors and managers will play a major role in how Salesforce.com is adopted throughout your organization,” emphasizes McPheat. “Will it be seen as a ‘divide and rule’ system used for sales person bashing, checking up all the time and for nit picking? Or will the system be used as something that really adds value to the sales process and one that enables the sales managers and sales directors to mentor and coach their sales people to a greater level of performance?”
Keep Salesforce.com simple

“In our experience, the reason many sales users get frustrated with Salesforce.com is because it is too complex,” says Walton. “Often, they are forced to comply with data-intensive screens and complete mandatory fields that are not always specifically relevant to their everyday sales role. And when faced with adapting to a new system, users that do not have the time to learn how to use the system – or do not see the benefits of the new process in their day to day life – will reject the system, bypass the important fields or add false information.”

Garman adds: “The key is make it simple – after all 40% of activities recorded in a basic system is better than nothing in a fancy one.  Don’t do too much too soon and make it manageable.

The Salesforce Admin
The Salesforce administrator—or “admin” is a Salesforce user with system administration duties and other super powers. Admins are
responsible for setting up Salesforce for their organizations and making sure it runs smoothly.
Admins have special permissions. For example, they can add user accounts and specify what people can see and do in Salesforce. Admins
can create custom Salesforce objects, workflows, validation rules, reports, and more. Admins can manage user profile information and
delete Chatter feed updates, including posts and comments. Admins are planners, problem-solvers, and heroes. All Salesforce organizations
have at least one administrator. Your administrator’s role can be as simple or as complex as your company’s size and structure. In smaller
organizations, the admin is often someone who also uses Salesforce the way other users do: to sell products or provide customer service,
for example.
Salesforce offers lots of features and items that you can set up and configure yourself. For some things, though, partner with your trusty
admin to help you get the best of what Salesforce has to offer.
Here are a few examples of the kinds of things your admin can help you with or do for you.
• Find or use an object, field, or feature you heard about during training.
• Create a custom workflow that lets you find out when a case is closed.
• Create a custom approval process that allows you to sign off on employee expenses.
• Create a custom report for your sales region.
• Give you a user permission that’s not granted as part of your user profile.
• Answer questions about your own or others’ access to records.
• Address those cursed error messages that ask you to contact your administrator for help or more information.
How you contact your administrator, and when and why, depends on your company’s internal business policies and practices.
What Happens When You Purchase Salesforce
New to Salesforce, or maybe you’re not so new? In either case, to get the most out of Salesforce, it helps to know how your org is created
and the types of licenses, permissions, and profiles that you receive. Understanding how these elements interact and impact what users
can do saves you time.
5
Get Started with Salesforce The Salesforce Admin
When your order is activated, our provisioning process creates a license request. The license request includes definitions that build out
your org. These definitions consist of settings that indicate which licenses, permissions, and profiles you receive. It’s these basic elements
that shape the org that you use and what users can do in it.
You probably know that we offer different license types. Think of them as org-level and user-level licenses. You can also purchase
permission set licenses and add-on licenses.
Org-Level Licenses
When you purchase Salesforce, you purchase an org-level license, or edition. An edition defines your:
• Features, such as contracts or Collaborative Forecasts
• Amounts, such as quantity of storage and the number of sandboxes
To check how much storage or the number of sandboxes that your org has, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Storage Usage
or Sandboxes.
User-Level Licenses
Your org receives a specific number of user licenses, such as Salesforce or Chatter Free user licenses. A user license defines:
• User permissions, such as Activate Contracts or View All Forecasts
• CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) access allowed on objects, such as who can create a contract or delete an account
When you create users, you assign each one to a user license. A user license defines the permissions or the maximum capabilities that
a user can have.
To see which user licenses your org has, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Company Information, and then select User Licenses.
Permission Set Licenses
Permission set licenses let you offer more functionality to users in your org. An example of a permission set license is Identity Connect.
When you purchase a permission set license, you receive user permissions pertaining to the license and the accompanying CRUD
permissions. For example, with Identity Connect, you receive the Use Identity Connect permission, which allows assigned users to use
the feature.
To check which permission set licenses your org has, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Company Information, and select
Permission Set Licenses.
Add-On Licenses
Your org receives a specific number of user licenses, such as Salesforce or Chatter Free user licenses. A user license defines:
• User permissions, such as Activate Contracts or View All Forecasts
• CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) access allowed on objects, such as who can create a contract or delete an account
When you create users, you assign each one to a user license. A user license defines the permissions or the maximum capabilities that
a user can have. To see which user licenses your org has, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Company Information, and
then select User Licenses.
Add-on licenses extend functionality at the org level. An example is the purchase of more API requests to extend the limit for your org.

Permissions
User permissions specify:
• Tasks that users can perform
• Features that users can access in your org configuration
The base user permissions, such as Activate Contracts or View All Forecasts, that someone has depends on the user license assigned.
You can use profiles and permission sets to refine which permissions a group of users has.
For example, users with the View All Forecasts permission can view other users’ forecasts, but they must have the correct user license.
If you assign the Chatter Free user license to users, they do not receive the View All Forecasts permission because this user license does
not offer it.
To find which user license a user is assigned, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Users. Click the name of the user whose
information you want to view. Look for User License.
Profiles
You can have standard profiles and custom profiles, depending on the edition that you purchase. Profiles define:
• User access to objects and data
• What users can do within the org
When you create users, you assign each user a profile. A profile belongs to exactly one user license type. Let’s say that your purchase
comes with the Salesforce and Chatter Free license types, among others. You assign profiles to users based on these licenses.
For example, based on the Salesforce user license, you can assign the System Administrator, Standard User, or one of several other profiles
to a user. Based on the Chatter Free user license, you can assign only the Chatter Free User or Chatter Moderator User profiles to users.
You can create custom profiles to offer different permissions or functionality to users with the same user license. However, using a
permission set is typically a more efficient way to achieve the same goal. (Make sure that the permissions defined in the profile or
permission set don’t exceed the permissions defined in the user license, though.) For example, you can assign a profile to a group of
users. Then, you can assign users different permission sets to give certain people in that group more capabilities.

Licenses Overview
Push Updated Licenses to Sandbox Orgs
As your organization’s needs change, your licensing needs evolve. When you update licenses, you want your production and sandbox
orgs to be in sync. Often you can refresh your sandbox to ensure that its licensing information matches your production org’s. Or, to
ensure that your sandbox orgs receive updated license information, you can use the Match Production Licenses to Sandbox tool.
When you use the Match Production Licenses to Sandbox tool, all provisioned changes are matched in the production org.
To match licenses to a sandbox org, make sure that the status of the related production org is active. Then log in to your sandbox. From
Setup, go to Company Information, and select Match Production Licenses.
Warning: If the sandbox’s related production environment is in trial or demo status, do not use the matching tool. Using the tool
with a trial or demo org can result in destructive changes. If you’re unsure whether the sandbox’s production org is in active status,
log a case with Salesforce Customer Support. They can confirm your org’s status before you use the tool.
License Updates and Your Org
When you purchase Salesforce, you receive licenses, permissions, and profiles that shape your org and what users can do in it. You can
also create permission sets to help with permission management. Understand the impact of license updates on permissions in your
profiles and permission sets.
Changes to your org impact its functionality and your users. For instance, what happens if you upgrade your Salesforce edition? Or maybe
you decide to purchase an add-on license. Let’s say that your org:
• Upgraded from Professional Edition to Enterprise Edition
• Uses Service Cloud, and you purchased the additional functionality that the SOS add-on offers
After you upgrade:
• You want to use approval processes. Review the relevant user and object-level permissions for users who are approval admins.
• Ensure that you enable related features for the SOS add-on. Give users who need the add-on the correct permissions. For best results,
use Salesforce Help to set up your add-on. For example, you must enable Omni-Channel in your org before you set up SOS.
Each org is different, and each user has different requirements. When you purchase an upgrade or add-on, we suggest reviewing help
topics and videos in Salesforce Help and checking user permissions.

What is Salesforce? The Ultimate Guide for 2024

With the growing data generation, businesses are required to leverage a platform that helps them make use of their customer data well, and Salesforce is one such CRM platform. Salesforce is used by startups to Fortune 500 companies. In this Salesforce tutorial, you will walk through what is Salesforce and how beneficial it is.

Check out the following video to learn about Salesforce -

Why Use Salesforce?

Before moving to understand what is Salesforce, this tutorial will acquaint you with the term CRM. Back in time, employees managed manually data. They jotted down information and stored them in files. This way, they failed to make use of all the available data.

Gradually, as years passed by with the advent of computers, companies made use of Excel sheets and documents for managing their data. However, this approach proved to be time-consuming and inefficient when handling large volumes of data.

There was a requirement to effectively handle and analyze vast volumes of user data by every employee in the organization. By the term effective, it refers to methods that could be incorporated to improve customer satisfaction. This was when CRM, known as customer relationship management, was introduced, and it addressed the above issues.

Initially, customer relationship management (CRM) solutions were hosted on a company's server. This became time-consuming and highly expensive. Such CRMs were also challenging to use.

The solution was to build an affordable and cost-effective CRM software and provide it entirely online as a service. This was the core idea behind Salesforce.

What Is Salesforce?

Salesforce is a cloud-based software company that provides businesses with tools that help them find more prospects, close more deals, and provide a higher level of service to their customers.

Salesforce, Inc. is a famous American cloud-based software company that provides CRM services. Salesforce is a popular CRM tool for support, sales, and marketing teams worldwide.

Salesforce services allow businesses to use cloud technology to better connect with partners, customers, and potential customers. Using the Salesforce CRM, companies can track customer activity, market to customers, and many more services.

A CRM platform helps you go deeper with all your metrics and data; you could also set up a dashboard that showcases your data visually. In addition to this, you can also have personalized outreach with automation. Another significant benefit is that a CRM platform can also improve customer service's ability to help customers or a sales team's outreach efforts.
What Does Salesforce Do?

Salesforce is a cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform that enables businesses to manage customer data, sales operations, and marketing campaigns. It provides various features, and tools businesses can use to improve customer relationships, including customer segmentation, customer data management, and customer support. Salesforce also offers a variety of integrations with third-party applications and services, making it a powerful and versatile CRM platform.
How Does Salesforce Work?

Salesforce is a CRM platform and also a centralized platform for managing customer accounts, sales leads, activities, customer support cases, and more. Users can access Salesforce through a web browser, mobile app, or desktop application.

Salesforce Architecture

This tutorial will now briefly walk you through the Salesforce architecture. Here, you will be acquainted with the different layers of the Salesforce architecture individually.

    Multi-tenant: Salesforce stores data in a single database schema. There can be a single instance of a software server with multiple tenants. Speaking about a multi-tenant architecture, there is a single shared application service to several clients. This makes it cost-effective. On the contrary, in a single-tenant, the development and maintenance cost must be entirely owned by one client. Hence the multi-tenant architecture is a boon.
    Metadata: Salesforce uses a metadata-driven development model. This allows developers to only focus on building the application. This metadata-driven platform makes customization and scaling up easy.
    API: Salesforce provides a powerful source of APIs. This helps in developing and customizing the Salesforce1 Mobile App. Every feature of the Salesforce design has been planned and implemented precisely.

The Top 7 Benefits of Salesforce
1. Better Time Management

Time management is a huge benefit of Salesforce and one of the best ways to allow a business to grow and thrive. Thanks to comprehensive customer information and useful planning resources, you have everything you need in one place. No more time wasted searching through logs and files for important info.

With so much pertinent customer data, you can easily prioritize work for (and with) your clients by streamlining the sales funnel so that leads are quickly transformed into customers.

Salesforce also has a calendar feature that makes it easy to plan projects, meetings, phone calls, and more in one place. You’ll know what’s coming up and when.
2. Ultimate Accessibility

Since Salesforce is cloud software, it’s accessible anywhere and everywhere you have access to the Internet. Whether you use your desktop, laptop, or smartphone, Salesforce can be reached thanks to its app. This is important because many business owners and team members travel frequently, be it nationally, internationally, or even between cities.

Being able to reach your CRM tool through the protected cloud no matter where you are makes it easier to access important files and stay updated on clients. Sensitive information is more secure than it would be in a file cabinet or on a local server.
3. Increased Revenue

Without Salesforce, running a business in today’s world can cost you money. On any given day, your team might produce a ton of data that has to be stored. Without Salesforce, you’re most likely sorting through this data manually, and this is more time spent on administrative work as opposed to building customer relationships.

When your time is tied up, it means you have less time to improve business, make connections, and grow profits. Since the tool takes over these administrative duties and more, you’ll have more time to devote to the business, which means more money in the long run.
4. Greater Customer Satisfaction

Similar to increased revenue, it’s safe to assume customers are more satisfied when they interact with a business that knows their needs and the state of their relationship with you (thanks to your CRM tool). Spend less time on administrative duties and you’ll have more time to spend catering to your customers through a common platform.

Thanks to a highly efficient management system, you can serve your customers better by having quicker access to their information, accounts, purchase history, and preferences.

This Salesforce benefit not only improves your relationship with your customers – it sets you up for new customers too. When your current customers are happy with you, they’re more likely to be an ambassador for you and tell their friends.
5. Simple Account Planning

Salesforce makes it simple to create plans for accounts. With all the customer information you need readily accessible, you’ll have an easier time placing that info into the correct accounts, and then making plans for those accounts for optimal results for the customer.

Customers get products or services perfectly tailored to their needs, you stay organized, and you adjust your time effectively for each client. As these accounts are created, stronger connections are made with your clients by best meeting their needs, solving their problems, and keeping track of trends.
6. Trusted Reporting

With so much data pouring into your business, it’s easy to become lost. Salesforce keeps pertinent data organized and it helps you make sense of new data thanks to trustworthy reporting.

Keep track of all the data your business collects from social media, website analytics, app information, business software, and more. Reporting takes this mountain of information and sorts it, analyzes it, and makes it actionable. With the accuracy of Salesforce tech, you know the numbers are right and the readings can be trusted.
7. Improved Team Collaboration

Lastly, team collaboration is a major benefit of Salesforce. The software allows you to connect and communicate with team members from anywhere thanks to the “Chatter” feature. This lets you connect with individual team members or full groups and chat about everything from your clients and their information to other work-related topics such as territory and product/service details.

When the team is on the same page, your business is more cohesive and operates more efficiently so that deadlines are met and sales are finalized.

Whether you’re looking for an app to help you close more deals, manage your projects, or get more out of your CRM, App exchange has the solution for you.
What Made Salesforce an Instant Hit?

    Salesforce was an instant hit when it launched in 1999 because it was the first customer relationship management (CRM) software application delivered over the internet. It allowed businesses of all sizes to access and use the software without installing it on their servers.
    And Salesforce revolutionized traditional CRM software by making it cloud-based and browser-agnostic. It was the first to introduce an entirely new pricing model based on usage, which was much more attractive to small business owners with limited IT budgets.
    Additionally, it was one of the first to offer a wide range of features and services, including customer service, marketing automation, and analytics. Finally, its customer service was top-notch and responsive, making it easy for customers to get the help they needed.

1 / 5 Blog from Introduction to SalesForce
myMock-desk-banner-bg

In recent years, there has been a big surge in Cloud Computing Technologies. One such technology which has had an immense impact on the world of computing is Salesforce. In this blog, I will introduce you to Salesforce and will answer following questions:

    What is Salesforce?
    Why use Salesforce?
    Where is Salesforce being utilized?
    Why companies are looking for professionals with Salesforce Certification?

How It All Began?

Before Salesforce, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solutions were hosted on a company’s own server. Can you imagine the cost and time it took for companies to have their own CRM solutions? Well, it used to take months or even years to set it up and the cost went up to millions of dollars. Even after setting up, they were extremely hard to use. What would be a feasible solution to this? I am sure you guessed it – building an affordable CRM software and delivering it entirely online as a service. This was the main idea behind Salesforce. Started as a Software as a Service (SaaS) company, it has grown into the fifth-largest software company in the world.

What Made Salesforce An Instant Hit?

The answer to this is very simple, it was Cloud Computing. Salesforce wasn’t just about a better product at a fraction of the cost. It was about replacing the lengthy installation process and moving everything to the internet. They changed the business model – no more long-term contracts or expensive licensing deals, anyone could use Salesforce with only a simple 50-dollar monthly subscription fee.

What is Salesforce?

Before I answer this question, let me brief you about why you should choose this CRM tool.

what is salesforce
Benefits of salesforce:

    As seen in the above image, Salesforce CRM provides you with the fastest path from Idea to App. You can concentrate on building your app using this tools, rather than building the infrastructure and tools yourself. This can save you years of time and millions of dollars.
    Salesforce customers generally say that it’s unique for three major reasons:
        Fast – Traditional CRM software can take more than a year to deploy, compare that to months or even weeks with Salesforce.
        Easy – Salesforce wins in the easy to use category hands down. You can spend more time putting it to use and less time figuring it out.
        Effective – Because it is easy to use and can be customized to meet business needs, customers find Salesforce very effective.
    Salesforce is in the cloud, so your team can use it from anywhere with access to the internet.
    If you are a business that is rapidly changing or you are a seasoned company that’s been around for years, your business is probably changing too. Salesforce is completely scalable to your growth.
    Salesforce seamlessly integrates with 3rd party apps. If you want to integrate Salesforce with Gmail you can do it, if you want to integrate it with your accounting software you can do that too. On the other hand, integration is tough with other CRMs.
    Salesforce is affordable, especially if you consider its vast variety of capabilities. Even startups and small business can use Salesforce.

Salesforce Use Case

We have seen above how different companies are using Salesforce to solve problems and improve productivity. Now, let’s look at how Hindustan Computer Limited (HCL) utilized Salesforce to solve its business challenges.

    HCL wanted to cater to the changing business requirements. To solve this problem, HCL wanted to implement, integrate and migrate to a new sales force application (SFA – software that automates business tasks) from their previous .NET SFA.
    HCL wanted to overcome the challenges of data redundancy and inconsistency caused by multiple applications.

To solve these business challenges HCL chose to implement SFA using Salesforce.com. HCL evaluated Salesforce and found that it met their requirements in regard to security, governance, collaboration and integration with third party applications.

The above image shows the different modules that were implemented to solve the challenges. Below I have explained these modules in detail.

Lead Management Module – HCL used the Salesforce standard solution for lead capturing and assignment, lead qualification and conversion. They developed a custom solution for capturing leads from external sources and screening leads to prevent duplication.

Account Management Module – HCL used the Salesforce standard account management module and implemented a custom solution for defining business logic for real-time search for customer accounts, manage the flow of data and manage daily batch updates.

How Are Salesforce Sales Cloud and Salesforce Marketing Cloud Similar?

Because they’re both from the same Salesforce CRM suite, Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud overlap. Both are used to track leads with the ultimate goal of converting them into customers. However, the solutions emphasize different parts of the customer lifecycle. Salesforce Marketing Cloud is built to identify leads and guide them toward your product or service, while Salesforce Sales Cloud is built to close deals and bring in revenue.
What Does Salesforce Sales Cloud Do?

Salesforce Sales Cloud manages the entire sales funnel, bringing in leads, qualifying them into prospects and opportunities, and eventually converting them to loyal customers. Sales teams use this software to find and capture leads and manage contact accounts. There is naturally some marketing functionality within software like Salesforce Sales Cloud, but this software is not intended to drill down into the early lead-qualification process. Rather, it covers a broader range of consumer readiness to offer a holistic view of the entire customer journey.

The Essentials edition of Salesforce Sales Cloud includes these unique features:

    Management Tools
        Lead Management
        Account Management
        Opportunity Management
        Contact Management
    Case Management for Upselling and Cross-selling
    Workflow Automation
    Integrations with Outlook and Gmail
    A Mobile Application

Salesforce Sales Cloud is available as a monthly subscription, and businesses are able to choose between four price tiers of service with varying capabilities.
What Does Salesforce Marketing Cloud Do?

Think of Salesforce Marketing Cloud as a suite within a suite. Marketing Cloud does not come in four tiers of increasing functionality like Sales Cloud. Instead, companies pay a flat rate for specific marketing modules. Some of these individual modules are available at different tiers, but overall, marketing teams will need to select specific modules from the following:

    Salesforce CDP – A customer data platform for aggregating, segmenting, and organizing customer data
    Loyalty Management – B2B and B2C loyalty programs to incentivize partners and customers
    Pardot – B2B marketing automation with lead management, email marketing tools, and more

    Salesforce CMS – A content management system to help your marketing team develop unique, varied content for several buyer personas

Salesforce also sells Google Marketing Platform as part of the Marketing Cloud, which comes with advanced Google Analytics views and Tag Manager 360 for website tags and keywords.
Can I Use Salesforce Sales Cloud and Salesforce Marketing Cloud Together?

Yes, you can! Because they are part of the same platform and offered by the same software provider, Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud integrate seamlessly with one another and other Salesforce solutions. Of course, your business may only need one solution to run more efficiently.
Which Salesforce Cloud Product Is Best for My Business?

Consider the following table to understand which Salesforce CRM application might be a good fit for your company.

Article Highlights

    Salesforce Sales Cloud is tailored for direct sales management, focusing on optimizing the sales process from lead capture to revenue, whereas Salesforce Marketing Cloud concentrates on customer engagement across various marketing channels.
    While both platforms utilize advanced data analytics for enhancing customer interactions, their core functionalities diverge with Sales Cloud focusing on direct sales activities and Marketing Cloud on broad-based marketing strategies.
    Integration capabilities within Salesforce allow both Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud to seamlessly share data and insights, ensuring a unified approach to customer relationship management.

However, both represent different paths of your customer-acquisition cycle.

In short, the Sales Cloud is designed to streamline your sales processes and bring revenue. The Marketing Cloud is designed to nurture leads, convert them into prospects, and guide them about your product or service. In this article, you will understand their fundamental differences and identify which one is better for your business.

    But before discussing their differences, we must understand the similarities between Sales and Marketing Cloud. Let's get started.

Similarities between Salesforce Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud

Sales and Marketing Clouds help businesses track leads and convert them into customers. Although these clouds use different methods, both fundamentally work on advancing the customer acquisition process.
🤝
Moreover, both use data analytics for customer engagement, decision-making, and further business growth. Although the focus of Sales Cloud is to close deals and the focus of Marketing Cloud is to identify leads, both aim to elevate customer experience.

Sales and Marketing Clouds exist within a shared ecosystem, allowing for seamless integration with each other and other Salesforce solutions. This interconnectedness facilitates the efficient exchange of information and insights between sales and marketing teams.
Salesforce Sales Cloud

Salesforce Sales Cloud is a one-of-a-kind tool within the CRM system. It is specifically built for the sales team of a business, irrespective of the nature (B2B or B2C). Sales teams use this software to manage the end-to-end processes of the sales department.

    From capturing leads to converting them into loyal customers, Sales Cloud helps you with everything. You can also use it to create campaigns, manage leads' contacts and accounts, automate messaging and reports, etc.

Additionally, like other software of the CRM suite, Sales Cloud is entirely customizable. Your team can reiterate the whole software and conduct their sales operations in whichever way they see fit.

Data management is one of the most critical aspects of using Marketing Cloud. It helps you store various customer data and also allows you to create your own data model. Marketing Cloud can integrate with various third-party apps.

#1. You should pick Salesforce Sales Cloud:

    If you want to improve your sales funnel (in terms of quality and speed), get more closed deals, and generate more revenue.
    If you look forward to improving your lead management, opportunity tracking, and sales analytics to expedite the process.
    If your business requires 1-on-1 sales interactions and personalized strategies to book customers.

    If you are focused on getting better reach, boosting leads, and expanding your customer base through targeted channels.
    If you wish to enhance your business's digital footprint and engage with prospects via personalized marketing campaigns.
    If you want to automate marketing tasks, deliver content, and track campaign effectiveness.

Can you use both together?
🎉
Absolutely! We all know that Salesforce is the leading and most preferred CRM solution globally. There are many reasons for that – one of them is integration. Salesforce allows its every solution to integrate with other Salesforce solutions easily.

Both Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud can be seamlessly integrated with each other. However, in most cases, businesses only require one of the solutions. Although both clouds have separate use cases, Sales Cloud is more popular for businesses than Marketing Cloud.

    According to Backlinko, Salesforce Sales Cloud brings $5.19 billion in revenue for Salesforce, while Marketing and Commerce Cloud brings a total of $3.13 billion combined.

The sky's the limit when you're in Salesforce's cloud
☁️
Businesses use both clouds together because of their interconnectedness, especially in enterprise-level Salesforce implementations.

But, in the end, the choice to pick one or both depends solely on your business objectives. Carefully assess your requirements, the team that will work on it, and then make your decision.

Remember that you have the flexibility of integration and various tiers that both have to offer. If you wish to know more about these Salesforce solutions, explore the following overview pages by Salesforce:

Built for productivity, powered by relevance.

The legacy playbook of ""do more, sell more"" is broken. Hiring more reps, demanding more activities, and adopting more technology no longer guarantees productivity. Growth has stagnated, teams are discouraged, reps are unable to connect with customers, and leaders are unable to predictably scale.

Sales Hub empowers sales teams to index on quality over quantity. It equips them with both the connected tools they need to regain productivity and the context they need to deepen customer connections. Plus, it gives sales leaders the intelligence to scale insightfully.

This article was reviewed and updated September 2021.
It's Worth Your Time to Understand the Benefits and Features of HubSpot. We Promise.

Throughout life, we have to make some pretty important decisions, such as choosing a college major, deciding on a career path, and saying yes or no to a potentially life-changing job opportunity.

If you're a business owner or you work in marketing, an important decision you may have to make is ""Which marketing platform should we use?"" Which is probably why you are reading this blog article.

At TANK New Media we love HubSpot, inbound marketing, growth-driven design, and coffee. In fact, we love them so much that we eat, sleep, and breathe them (probably the reason for our coffee obsession).

Now it's your turn to fall in love with them, too. But it all starts with HubSpot.

But why use HubSpot? Here's an overview of the benefits and features of the platform.
What is HubSpot?

As the inbound approach to marketing and sales has become an increasingly popular and effective method for business growth, it's no surprise that there's an abundance of tools that are available to marketers. Deciding on which tools to use, figuring out if they can work together, and implementing them can be a struggle.

This is when you start to fall in love with HubSpot, because it's all your tools in one platform.

If this is your first interaction with it, you may be asking ""What is HubSpot?"" Well, in short, HubSpot is an inbound marketing & sales software that helps companies attract visitors, convert leads, and close customers.

The platform is designed as a one-stop-shop to help you execute inbound marketing from beginning to end, replacing all of those other various marketing tools (think Google Spreadsheets, SalesForce, HootSuite, etc.)

Let's dive in and find out what makes this robust platform highly attractive.

HubSpot Marketing Software — Everything You Need in One Place for an Effective Marketing Campaign

The marketing software of HubSpot's platform can take most, if not all, of the various marketing tools you're already using and unite them or replace them. HubSpot's marketing platform is for creating and promoting buyer-driven content using the following features.

Blogging

HubSpot's fully integrated blogging platform equips you or your content creators with a powerful tool to generate traffic to your website. Engaging content is a must for inbound marketing. HubSpot makes it easy to write, format, and edit blog content with their on-page editor that allows you to start a post from scratch or use one of their pre-made blog templates.

HubSpot makes your SEO optimization ""easy like Sunday morning."" While creating your blog content, you can get as-you-type keyword suggestions and SEO advice in order to outrank your competitors for your keywords that matter.

Now it's time to promote, promote, promote!

Get your blog in front of the right people at the right time with HubSpot's calendar tool. Plan your editorial calendar and schedule your posts to publish at the best times. Even connect your social media accounts to automatically share the new content. Your subscribers can receive your blogs automatically as they are published with customizable subscriber emails.

After all that hard work you'll want to see how your blog post performed. HubSpot's built-in analytics tool will identify which posts are generating traffic, leads, and customers so you know what content drives results.

Landing Pages

If you could do one thing to dramatically improve your marketing ROI, it would be to use landing pages on your website.

How can you do that on HubSpot? HubSpot provides a built-in-library of mobile-optimized templates, or you can build a landing page from the ground up with their user-friendly editor. Want to preview what your page will look like on mobile, an iPad and desktop before publishing? HubSpot's got you covered! The beauty of this feature is you don't need a designer or IT person to launch a professional looking landing page.

You can display personalized content, calls-to-action (CTA), and forms for each and every visitor to improve the performance of your landing pages. Dynamically show different content based on a visitor’s location, source, device, buying stage, or any other contact detail stored in your CRM.

Once your landing page is live, you can analyze its performance and perform A/B tests on every element in order drive the most conversions. Just like the blog feature, you can also get customized keyword suggestions while writing. The opportunities are endless!

Email

Again, ""Why Go HubSpot?"" you ask. Well, there's no need for designers or an IT person to create a professional email design. With HubSpot's drag-and-drop feature you can maneuver your way to reusable, branded email templates, or choose from their extensive library.

You can tailor your emails to each subscriber to generate a higher open rate with name personalization. HubSpot can tap into your subscriber's lifecycle stage, list membership' and other information stored in the CRM to serve up the most relevant subject lines, links, and CTA.

The best part? You can schedule your email campaign then sit back and relax knowing your emails will show up in each inbox at the most optimal time, regardless of time zones. Voilà!

Marketing Automation

Lead your leads (see what we did there?) through their own path to close more deals with marketing automation. With marketing automation, you can use each lead's behavior to tailor emails, content, offers, and outreach at scale.

Automate your email campaigns so you can move prospects further down the funnel and generate more qualified leads. You can choose from dozens of triggers, conditions, and actions to send the right emails to the right leads at the right time.

Guess what? Automation isn't just for email. You can automate a variety of tasks and trigger internal notifications to your team when a contact makes a noteworthy action so they know with whom to follow up. Now that's fancy!

Lead Management

How much time have you or your sales team wasted combining data from disconnected tools and databases? With HubSpot's lead management you can access every detail about a lead in a single profile.

It also provides you with a chronological timeline of every touchpoint between a contact and your company — such as emails, page visits, social media interactions, and downloads — so you never miss a beat!

The best part is that HubSpot's inbound marketing platform and HubSpot's free CRM work together seamlessly. Note this — If you're using Salesforce as your CRM, there's a Salesforce and HubSpot integration available. Talk about database power!

Website

Have we mentioned HubSpot makes things easy? Just like the landing pages, and emails, you can also build entire websites from scratch with ease with a simple drag-and-drop builder. Content can be personalized for every type of visitor, and those SEO recommendations to get your website to the top of Googles search.

With HubSpot:

    Your site is mobile optimized from the start.
    Your pages will automatically adjust to any device your visitor may have.
    You can see what your site will look like on any device.

Is their website tracking you ask? Why of course! With HubSpot's integrated analytics you can measure just about anything you need on your website!

Analytics

You want data? HubSpot supports your results-driven thirst! Measure your whole marketing funnel from acquisition to close.

No one wants to waste time with leads that aren't qualified. This software can measure the quantity and quality of traffic you are getting to your website. Analyze how your pages are performing and which traffic sources bring the most visits, contacts, and customers over time. Once you know which sources are driving the highest value — feed the winners!

The analytics tool provides you with detailed reports for every one of your marketing assets including websites, landing pages, emails, blog posts, social media accounts, and so on. You'll have all the data you need to take over the world! Muahaha!

SEO

Why was the SEO expert so frustrated on his way to work? Too much traffic...go figure! With HubSpot SEO, you won't experience frustration, but you will have plenty of traffic (the good kind!). You'll never miss a ranking opportunity. HubSpot will identify the right keywords and topics to target in your content so you can gain visibility from keywords that matter.

You can even see how your competitors are ranking for the keywords you are targeting in a single dashboard. Utilize this data to modify your SEO strategy.

Social Media Publishing & Monitoring

In case we haven't mentioned, HubSpot keeps things easy. That's why you can publish to social networks in the same place that you build campaigns.

Share content — blog posts, landing pages, and more — directly to LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ quickly and easily. Plus you can connect your social accounts to your company's blog for seamless automatic publishing. Don't want to post something right away? Schedule content to get in front of your followers at the right moment.

HubSpot's social media monitoring allows you to connect with people who matter. Social interactions are linked to real people in your database which enables you to prioritize conversations with people interested in engagement. And never miss an opportunity to engage, nurture leads, or delight customers with trigger email alerts when a prospect mentions you, a specific keyword, or hashtag.

Dive deeper and create custom keyword monitoring streams for team members to surface the interactions they care about.

HubSpot makes the struggle of reporting social media ROI a thing of the past. All of your marketing is integrated with your CRM so you can see the number of visits, leads, and customers your social media is generating for your company.

Calls-to-Action

Once your readers ingest your content, what do you want them to do?

    Visit your website?
    Schedule a sales meeting?
    Download a content offer?

That's where CTA's come in handy!

HubSpot's CTA builder creates professional CTA buttons or pop-ups in a few easy steps. Insert them into web pages, landing pages, blog posts, etc. to turn every piece of content into a conversion machine.

People like personalization, so attract them with personalized CTA's by using any detail in your contacts database. HubSpot can even tailor CTAs to anonymous visitors based on their location, device, referral source, or preferred language. Therefore everyone gets a customized experience!

Test your CTAs with A/B testing to create data-driven decisions and say goodbye to the guesswork.

Ads

Sadly, ad clicks don't equal instant money in your company's bank account. HubSpot's ads add-on reaches beyond traditional ad metrics to report on actual leads and ROI generated by every single Facebook and AdWords ad. This way you can know exactly how your paid ads are performing.

Your HubSpot list can be utilized to form a bond with a Facebook Ads audience. This eliminates manual uploads and enables automatic targeting of prospects.

You don't have to manage your AdWords and Facebook ads on their separate platforms. All of your ad creation can be completed and managed inside HubSpot. Leads generated with those ads will instantly go into your HubSpot CRM.

Salesforce Integration

We all strive for harmony, especially when it comes to our marketing and sales databases. With HubSpot you can do exactly just that. HubSpot syncs with Salesforce with an easy phone-based setup process. Plus, you get a team of engineers and support staff to maintain and improve your integration.

You will never have to export a list from Salesforce to kick off a campaign or personalize a marketing email. If your sales team closes a lead, Salesforce will send the data right into HubSpot.

Are you done asking ""Why Go HubSpot?"" yet? We're still going strong with reasons to use HubSpot. Let's look at the sales software features.

Get Started Creating Your Digital Marketing Plan

HubSpot Sales Software — Time-Saving Sales Tools to Help You Sell More and Work Less

HubSpot Sales Pro helps you connect with the right people at the right time with the right message.

Also, HubSpot Sales Pro gives you everything you need to increase productivity, shorten deal cycles, and make the sales process more human-friendly without adding to your workload.

These following features will have your sales team cranking out leads and closing deals.
Sales Automation

Similar to the Marketing Software's automation, HubSpot's Sales Software takes all of those manual and time-consuming tasks that your sales reps do on a daily basis and automates them. Rotate leads, create deals and tasks, and more.

Pipeline Management

You want to focus on the right deals, right? HubSpot's Pipeline Management features help you do just that. The CRM will swiftly create new deals when adding them from a contact or company record by populating most of the deals automatically with the most up-to-date information. So, less time on data entry and more time for prospecting!

The pipeline management is also customizable to you so you can create your ideal process. Use the sales dashboard to check your progress toward sales quotas so you are always in the know.

Email Scheduling

You won't even have to leave your Gmail account to schedule an email. Simply click the schedule icon on your Gmail composition window and choose a time. How efficient!

Emails are all about timing. Get your emails to the top of your recipient's inbox at the best time. You can choose from several pre-selected times based on data, or select your own.

While emails are scheduled, you can still go in and edit them before they are sent out. No more anxiety of constantly checking your email!

Email Sequences

By automating your follow-up, you instantly have more time put back into your day! Send a series of timed emails to your prospect so you never lose touch. Choose from a list of messages, and enroll a contact right from your inbox.

Just because your automating emails, doesn't mean you have to be impersonal. Use personalization tokens to tailor the emails in your sequence with contact and company details from HubSpot CRM or Salesforce. Then add a human touch to your email with specific details.

HubSpot will supply you with data so you know what sequences are working the best for you so you can optimize your email for the best results.

Email Tracking

Eliminate the guesswork with email tracking! Get a notification the second a lead opens an email and clicks a link inside. These notifications will aid you in sending a perfectly timed follow up.

The tracking history includes an activity stream that automatically logs each leads history inside HubSpot Sales.

Email Templates

In sales, you are always sending repetitive emails. With HubSpot's email templates you can turn your most effective and repetitive emails into templates that are accessed right in your email inbox when composing an email. HubSpot has a library of built-in templates, or you can make your own. Imagine the hours you will save!

Real-time metrics show you which templates are performing and which ones need some TLC. Your open rates tell you which subject lines your leads and customers can’t help but click.

Document Tracking

HubSpot has a one-stop-shop for all of your sales documentation. You have the ability to build and share one document or an entire library of your sales content for your entire team to access.

When a lead opens a document, you will be instantly notified so you can follow up in a timely and relevant way. Optimize your documents and personalize your pitch by seeing who views each document and which pages they spend time on.

Calling

HubSpot's calling and call tracking feature will prioritize and create a queue for your daily sales calls using engagement and property dating from the CRM so you can spend less time dialing and more time selling!

A really nifty feature of this tool is the fact you don't ever have to leave your browser or pick up a phone to place a call. With one click you are connected to a prospect through Voice Over IP on your desk phone. Your calls will always come from your personal number with the option to record each call so nothing gets missed!

Say goodbye to grunt work! All calls are automatically logged to HubSpot CRM or Salesforce.

Live Chat

With HubSpot's Sales Pro live chat tool, you can connect directly with prospects in real time when they’re actively engaging with your website — which is the perfect time as they are interested and active in the buying process.

With the live chat tool, conversations can be routed to the right sales person to build better relationships and close more deals. Leads and conversations are seamlessly synced into HubSpot so sales rep, can continue to nurture those relationships as well as schedule follow-up tasks.

Again, no need for an IT person to get this up and running! All you have to do is grab the code snippet and embed it on any page on your website you want live chat to appear! Just like that, everything is connected. Your live chat window's look and feel is also customizable.

Meeting Scheduling

The back-and-forth meeting scheduling is a thing of the past with HubSpot's meeting widgets. The power now lies in the hands of your prospects, and they like it! Meeting widgets sync with your calendar so prospects can see your real-time  availability. These widgets and schedulers can be placed on your website and in emails.

Send group meeting links to allow prospects to book time with more than one person in your organization. If you don't have a set sales rep, there is a round robin meeting link for your prospect to book a meeting with the rep that best fits their schedule.

When meetings are booked, HubSpot instantly creates a record in the CRM.

Custom Reports & Report Templates

Imagine ALL of your data in one place. Now that's a happy thought! Report on any metric from HubSpot Marketing, any record from HubSpot CRM, and any data from integrated apps and customize it towards your needs.

HubSpot offers a library of reporting templates or build your own and choose between pie charts, bar, chars, donut charts, and area charts (oh my!). Then your data is there in real time.

Sharing metrics with your team is crucial. With custom reporting you can create an unlimited number of dashboards so everyone can hone in on the data that matters to them.

HubSpot, a cutting-edge marketing, sales and customer service platform, stands out as a comprehensive solution for companies seeking to enhance their online presence and improve the effectiveness of their campaigns.

Through this analysis, we will not only understand the capabilities and benefits of HubSpot but also how it can be used to transform your digital strategy, regardless of your company’s size or industry.
What is HubSpot and what is it for?

HubSpot is a leading marketing, sales, and customer service platform known for its ability to simplify and enhance digital business strategies. At its heart, HubSpot is a complete software system forinbound marketing, a methodology that attracts customers by providing valuable content and customized solutions. This approach differs markedly from traditional outbound marketing, which relies on more direct and often intrusive promotion techniques.

HubSpot’s story begins in 2006, when co-founders Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah, noticing a fundamental shift in consumer behavior, realized that traditional marketing methods were becoming less effective. So they developed HubSpot with the goal of helping companies adapt to this change by focusing on inbound marketing techniques. Since then, HubSpot has steadily evolved, becoming not just a marketing software, but a comprehensive platform that supports all stages of customer acquisition and management, from first interaction to retention.

This evolution has allowed HubSpot to remain at the forefront of digital marketing, offering tools that meet the needs of a rapidly changing marketplace.

The platform combines CRM (customer relationship management), marketing automation, sales, content management, customer services and analytics, creating an integrated ecosystem that enables companies to attract visitors, convert them into customers and cultivate lasting relationships.
What can be done with HubSpot?

HubSpot is a versatile platform that offers a wide range of features to support different areas of digital business. Here is a list of some of its key features, accompanied by concrete examples of how they can be applied in various business scenarios:

    Comprehensive CRM: At the heart of HubSpot is a powerful CRM system that enables companies to manage and analyze interactions with customers and prospects. For example, a company can use HubSpot’s CRM to track the entire customer lifecycle, from lead to loyalty, gaining a complete and detailed view of their needs and behaviors.
    Marketing Automation: HubSpot enables the automation of complex marketing campaigns. An e-commerce company, for example, can use automation to send personalized emails to customers based on their purchase history, incentivizing repeat transactions or suggesting related products.
    Content Management: With its integrated CMS, HubSpot helps companies create, manage and optimize their web content. A travel agency can leverage this feature to create engaging blogs and landing pages that attract and convert visitors into customers.
    Sales Tools: HubSpot’s sales tools, including email tracking and appointment scheduling, can empower sales teams. A B2B software company can use them to monitor customer interest and schedule product demos efficiently.
    Customer Service: HubSpot provides tools for excellent customer service, such as ticketing and live chat. A financial services company can employ these tools to respond quickly to customer inquiries, improving customer trust and satisfaction.
    Analysis and Reporting: With HubSpot, companies can access in-depth data and analysis. A manufacturing company can use these analytics to understand which marketing channels generate the most leads and optimize advertising spend accordingly.

In summary, HubSpot offers an all-in-one solution that fits a variety of business needs, improving operations, optimizing marketing and sales strategies, and elevating the customer experience. Its features are designed to be intuitive and easily integrated, making them suitable for businesses of all sizes and industries.
Hubspot Contact Management and CRM

One of the key aspects of HubSpot is its robust contact management and CRM (customer relationship management) platform. Central to its effectiveness is the ability to centralize and organize all customer interactions and information in one accessible place. This allows companies to have a 360-degree view of each customer, making it easier to personalize the approach and improve relationships.

Contact management in HubSpot is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to track every interaction with customers, from email messages to in-person meetings. This data collection provides a detailed picture of customer preferences and behavior, which can be leveraged for targeted marketing campaigns and more effective customer service.

In addition, HubSpot’s CRM platform is designed to integrate seamlessly with other marketing, sales and service capabilities. This means that, for example, sales teams can access detailed lead information directly from the CRM, allowing them to tailor their sales techniques to the specific needs and interests of each potential customer. In addition, CRM automation features save companies valuable time by automating processes such as contact registration and interaction management.

HubSpot’s approach to contact management and CRM not only simplifies day-to-day operations, but also provides a solid foundation for building and maintaining lasting relationships with customers. Through this platform, companies can not only better understand their customers, but also act on this information to create more engaging and personalized experiences.
Marketing Automation with Hubspot

HubSpot’s ability to automate numerous marketing processes is one of its most significant strengths. Marketing automation through HubSpot results in a series of actions and processes automatically managed by the platform, ranging from sending personalized emails to customer segmentation to managing lead nurturing campaigns. These capabilities not only optimize operational efficiency, but also offer large-scale customization that was unthinkable with traditional techniques.

The platform allows the creation of customized automation paths based on customer actions. For example, if a site visitor downloads an e-book, HubSpot can automatically send a series of related emails to further guide the user through the sales funnel. This ability to react in real time to user behavior enables companies to remain relevant and engaging, increasing the likelihood of conversion.

The benefits of marketing automation are many. First, it saves valuable time by automating repetitive tasks, allowing marketing teams to focus on more creative strategies and ideas. Second, it improves the consistency and accuracy of marketing campaigns, reducing human error and ensuring that the right messages reach the right audience at the right time. Finally, it provides real-time analysis and data that can be used to continuously optimize marketing strategies.

In short, the marketing automation offered by HubSpot is not just about efficiency, but a fundamental change in the way companies can engage and convert their audiences.

Marketing automation through HubSpot transforms the way companies interact with customers and optimize their marketing strategies. A concrete example is the personalization of email campaigns. Imagine a visitor who leaves his or her email address on your site to receive a white paper. HubSpot can automatically initiate a sequence of personalized emails based on this behavior, first sending a thank-you message, followed by a series of informational emails related to the downloaded content, gradually increasing engagement.

Another example involves customer segmentation. Suppose your company offers several products or services. With HubSpot, you can create customer segments based on their interests or previous interactions with your site. This allows you to send targeted and relevant communications, such as specific promotions or relevant content, significantly increasing the likelihood of conversion.

In addition, automation can be used for lead nurturing. For example, if a potential customer shows interest in a certain type of product but does not proceed to purchase, HubSpot can automatically initiate a nurturing path by providing additional information, testimonials from other customers, or special offers to gently guide the lead toward a purchase decision.

Finally, think about using HubSpot to manage events or webinars. From automatic invitation sending, to registration, to post-event follow-up, every aspect can be automated and customized, enabling a smooth and engaging user experience.

Through these examples, it becomes evident how marketing automation on HubSpot is not only a means of streamlining processes, but a powerful tool for creating deeper and more meaningful relationships with customers, effectively guiding their path to purchase.
Inbound Marketing and Content Management

HubSpot can be the centerpiece of an inbound marketing strategy and in content management, providing specific tools that enable companies to attract, engage and delight customers. Inbound marketing, as opposed to traditional strategies, is based on creating valuable content that draws customers to your brand in an organic, non-invasive way.

One of the key tools offered by HubSpot in this context is its Content Management System (CMS). HubSpot’s CMS is designed specifically for the needs of inbound marketing, facilitating the creation, management and optimization of web content. With an intuitive editor and built-in SEO features, it enables companies to create search engine optimized web pages, blogs and landing pages, thereby increasing online visibility and attracting a wider audience.

In addition, HubSpot offers powerful content analysis tools that allow you to monitor the performance of various pieces of content and understand which are the most effective in reaching and engaging target audiences. This data can then be used to further refine content strategies and improve conversion rates.

Another key aspect of inbound marketing on HubSpot is its ability to personalize. Through audience segmentation and the use of behavioral data, HubSpot makes it possible to personalize the content shown to different user segments. This means that site visitors will see content relevant to their interests and previous interactions, increasing engagement and the likelihood of conversion.

Finally, HubSpot closely integrates content management with its other capabilities, such as CRM and marketing automation, creating a cohesive ecosystem where every customer interaction is informed and enhanced by the content they have consumed. This holistic approach not only makes inbound marketing strategies more effective, but also ensures a better overall customer experience.
HubSpot for Sales: Tools and Data Analysis

HubSpot offers a wide range of sales toolsthat transform the way companies manage and optimize their sales processes. These tools are designed not only to automate and simplify daily tasks, but also to provide in-depth data and analysis that can have a significant impact on sales strategies.

One of the most powerful tools HubSpot offers in the sales context is its Sales Hub. This suite of tools includes features such as sales task automation, appointment scheduling, email tracking and the creation of customizable sales pipelines. These features save sales teams valuable time by automating repetitive processes and focusing on what matters most: building customer relationships and closing deals.

A key aspect of HubSpot’s sales tools is their ability to provide detailed, real-time analytics. Through customizable dashboards, sales teams can get immediate insights into the performance of their activities, such as lead conversion rate, average length of sales cycles, and the effectiveness of different sales tactics. This data is crucial for making informed decisions and continuously optimizing sales strategies.

In addition, tight integration with HubSpot’s CRM ensures that all customer data is centralized and easily accessible. This means that every interaction with a customer can be tailored to their needs and their history with your company, significantly improving the chances of success in sales negotiations.

Data analysis plays a key role in optimizing sales strategies. For example, by analyzing customers’ buying patterns and collected feedback, sales teams can identify which products or services they find most interesting and adjust their strategies accordingly. In addition, predictive analytics can help identify which leads are most likely to convert into customers, allowing sales teams to focus their efforts more effectively.

In conclusion, HubSpot not only provides the tools needed to manage sales efficiently, but also provides the analytics and data needed to thoroughly understand the market and customer behaviors, enabling companies to adapt and refine their sales strategies to maximize results.

These resources enable companies to handle customer inquiries in a more efficient and organized manner, ensuring that every problem is resolved in a timely and professional manner.

For example, tickets can be automatically assigned to the team member best suited to resolve a particular issue, based on specific criteria such as request type or priority. In addition, the platform provides a knowledge base that enables customers to find answers to frequently asked questions themselves, thus reducing the workload on the support team and improving the customer experience.

Another key aspect of the Service Hub is its integration with HubSpot’s CRM, which provides a complete view of each customer. This integration ensures that the support team always has access to all relevant information, such as purchase history and previous interactions, to provide personalized service and detailed information, further improving the quality of support.

In addition, HubSpot provides detailed analysis of customer service performance, allowing key indicators such as response time, customer satisfaction, and frequency of service requests to be monitored. This data is essential for identifying areas for improvement, optimizing resources, and developing proactive strategies to increase customer satisfaction.

In conclusion, HubSpot offers a comprehensive and integrated customer service solution, combining effective tools with detailed analytics to ensure a superior customer service experience. This not only helps solve customers’ problems efficiently, but also helps build stronger and longer-lasting relationships with them.

With HubSpot, you have access to customizable dashboards that provide key metrics on different aspects of your business. This includes analysis on web traffic, conversion rates, performance of email marketing campaigns, effectiveness of sales channels, and more.

Another key aspect of HubSpot’s reporting tools is the ability to track the entire customer journey. This means you can follow a customer from first contact to conversion and beyond, providing valuable insights into how to optimize touchpoints along the journey.

Monitor your Sales Pipeline

Hubspot enables you to view your sales pipeline in its entirety, allowing you to forecast future business trends.

You can view how you’ve been performing weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly. It provides you with an in-depth view of your selling process to capture what’s closing deals and what’s not to make strategically important decisions.

In Deals, you can monitor different stages of your sales process to identify and resolve any deal breakers. It’ll help you to gauge your sales, and provide insights on productivity; calls made and received, emails sent and received, deals created and deals won.

Store and update contact details

Access and store all the contact details of your clients and prospects in one place.

Especially useful when your point of contact switches to a new role or a new company, you can update all the changes almost instantly from your HubSpot account.

Managing your contacts and updating them has never been easier.

Divide and assign each prospect to different reps

A good sales team knows how to be efficient and make their prospects feel like they’re being treated specially – prioritized and personalized.

That’s why sellers in Hubspot can assign each prospect to a specific sales rep depending on where the buyer is in their buying decision. These prospects are divided and assigned to reps for an efficient and effective sales process.

If the buyer is in the initial stages of buying, they are most likely to be assigned to a junior sales rep who can move them forward towards their buying decision.

Once that prospect is converted into a high-value lead, they are assigned to a senior rep who can close the deal with the right content.

What’s awesome about Hubspot is that when a prospect reaches out with a query or there’s a meeting scheduled, the respective rep will instantly receive a notification.

Connecting the prospect with the rep as soon as possible will allow your sellers more time to move them along the buyer’s journey and more quickly turn prospects into customers.

Send emails directly from Hubspot

With the HubSpot Sales extension/add-on in your email inbox, you enable your reps to send emails to your contacts directly and track the performance of those emails once they’d been read.

With that extension, you can also access sales tools directly on your personal email.

Whether you compose the email from scratch or use a pre-made sales or product messaging template, the extension enables you to reach out to your prospect at the right time with the right offer.

Using your personal email address, you can send one-to-one emails to any contact to further build that sense of familiarity and trust. No one on the team can use your personal email except for you, so your prospects know they’re getting your full attention.

Your reps can only send emails through their team email address which will be connected to the conversations inbox in Hubspot. That’s the email your reps will be using to connect with their respective prospects primarily.

Schedule meetings

With Hubspot, you create scheduling pages to share with your prospects so they can plan a meeting with you based on your calendar.

It’s a great way to get potential leads to book product demos.

It ensures that you’re never double-booked, so you can give your undivided attention to each prospect.

Set reminders

As a seller, you may have a lot on your plate and you may lose track of time since there’s only so much you can do.

With Hubspot, you can set reminders by date and time, and as the due date approaches for any task, scheduled meetings, calls, etc, the CRM will automatically send reminders.

With this feature, your sales team is always on top of their performance and organized in their day-to-day tasks.
Streamline your sales inquiries.

Many clients and prospects come from different channels for sales inquiries.Engaging on every channel can be a challenge for your sales team.

That’s why Hubspot offers a conversation inbox specifically for the sales team.

When a prospect reaches out with a sales inquiry, you want the right sales rep to engage. Especially when your reps are assigned specific prospects, you want them to engage with their assigned prospect to ensure a seamless buyer experience.

And to make that possible, Hubspot consolidates your inbox messages from your connected channels within its CRM. It creates a central location in Conversations for all your sales inquiries, and once you assign tickets for each conversation, your sales rep will respond to the right prospect at the right time.

Your reps no longer need to hop from one channel to another when they get access to all the conversations in a single inbox.

You don’t need your personal email to connect your inbox, you use your team email address to respond to all the messages, helping you streamline your sales inquiries.

Create chat flows

Let’s say you’re getting a lot of traffic on your website but for some reason, you aren’t getting many leads. That’s because your traffic most probably wasn’t convinced enough to reach out to you.

One often overlooked feature is a responsive chatflow between reps and prospects.

Hubspot helps you add chat widgets to your website so that potential leads could be routed to your conversations inbox where your sales rep can reply.

There are two options for you to pick from; live chat, and bot chatflow. Through bot chatflow, you can take your leads down a path of pre-set actions to narrow down their query and connect with an appropriate rep, all in real-time.

Get Actionable Insights

While you’re getting access to such exclusive features, HubSpot provides you with actionable insights on your sales performance. When you’re operating your entire sales efforts through Hubspot, it analyzes the impact of your sales efforts.

On top of that, your Hubspot CRM tracks your website traffic in real-time to identify key visitors who may be potential customers. You get to view their professional profile such as the company they work for or their role in the company. This will allow the sales rep to establish some key talking points to better engage with the prospect.

Not only are you able to better judge your sales progress, but you’re also enabling your sellers with key information to help them offer exactly what the prospect may need.

Hubspot Sales CRM: Turn-offs!

Hubspot is great but it isn’t perfect.

The reporting feature on hubspot’s CRM is not as detailed as a few of its competitors. You can view some information regarding the traffic, but due to lack of segmented traffic reports, its difficult to extract value.

And as if that wasn’t a turn off enough, HubSpot fails to provide data on mobile users navigating your website. Given that much of the users are on their mobile phones, having data on such users is incredibly important.

That’s why document tracking is also equally affected because Hubspot lacks in providing you with a variation of data insights that may help you better target your marketing and sales efforts.

Content Camel offers better document tracking functionality, with powerful reporting that is leaps and bounds ahead of Hubspot.

Find out How to Track Documents in Hubspot.

Another turn-off about Hubspot is that it’s expensive. If your team is working on a tighter budget, or you just know your specific needs, Content Camel tools can help compliment your sales stack better than a full Hubspot suite of solutions.

While Hubspot is offering a free version for a single user, as your business expands, you may need to upgrade your plan which will cost more for every single user you add.

Not to forget that their contracts are rigid. You either sign up for a 6-month plan or an annual plan, and they charge you upfront.

Another deal-breaker is that its templates are difficult to modify, and provide limited insights on all your sales efforts.

Even when you have made templates, if you want to personalize them a little bit before pressing send - HubSpot may not be such a great fit for you.",https://www.contentcamel.io/11-ways-to-use-hubspot-for-sales/,HubSpot

HubSpot - Good or Bad?

15 February 2024

HubSpot has become a SaaS behemoth since its inception in 2006, and for many, it’s the obvious choice for a CRM system. But what are the pros and cons of HubSpot? Certainly, HubSpot is not without its share of criticisms – we will take a look at what HubSpot actually does, why it is so popular, what HubSpot’s capabilities are beyond a CRM, and what the benefits and drawbacks are of using HubSpot.
What is HubSpot?

HubSpot is a CRM (customer relationship management) system that helps organisations manage their customers. A CRM is, at its most basic level, a database of customers and sales leads. Such a database allows businesses to communicate with their audience and potential customers effectively.

Keeping all customer info and communications in one place avoids the risk of losing potential sales and leaking unsecured private data. CRMs like HubSpot collect and store detailed info on your customers, such as purchases and communications, and allow all members of a team to access customer details and history.

HubSpot is a collection of six ‘hubs’ which include:
Marketing Hub

This is a collection of marketing tools and features which include lead generation, email marketing, automation, content creation, social media management and more. This enables businesses to develop and execute their marketing strategy.
Sales Hub

HubSpot’s Sales Hub offers sales tools such as contact management, email tracking and templates, document management, sales automation, reporting, and analytics. Sales Hub is helpful for businesses that prioritise building relationships with their customers and personalising their communications.
Service Hub

Service Hub provides customer service solutions that can be implemented by a customer service team. It provides features like ticketing, a shared inbox, live chat including AI-powered chatbots, email tracking, reporting and conversation routing, which assigns incoming chats and emails to an appropriate team member. This is suitable for a business with a large customer service team who must coordinate on offering a high standard of service.
CMS Hub

The CMS Hub, or Content Management System Hub gives businesses a platform through which they can create and optimise web content including landing pages, coding for added customisation, content creation e.g. blogs, email marketing and more. This hub also includes SEO, Google Search Console integration, plus other features that make it ideal for managing a business’s web presence.
Operations Hub

This hub allows businesses to streamline their operations and add automations to save time and resources. This includes features such as data syncing, programmable automation, customised chatbots, advanced reporting, integrations with other platforms, and more. This would be helpful for businesses who wish to align their sales and marketing efforts or access more insightful reports.
Commerce Hub

HubSpot’s Commerce Hub is designed for B2B businesses and offers tools for invoicing customers, providing quotes, taking payments, managing subscriptions, automated billing, reporting and more. Commerce Hub can also be integrated with accounting software such as Quickbooks and Xero.

What Does HubSpot Actually Do?

HubSpot is primarily a CRM system as briefly described above. HubSpot differs from some competitors by offering an ‘all-in-one’ system, as it includes many tools for marketing, sales, content management and customer service, broken down into the individual ‘hubs’, but all within one main program. Their marketing software package offers social media marketing tools as well as content management, revenue forecasting, data analytics, SEO tools, custom landing pages and more. There are plenty of other similar services that offer the same solutions, so what makes HubSpot so popular?
Why Is HubSpot So Popular?

The HubSpot CRM is well-known in the industry and for many, the obvious choice due to its free plan, helpful features like marketing tools and integrations with G Suite and Microsoft Office, and the HubSpot Academy which offers free courses in all aspects of CRM and digital marketing.

A big draw of HubSpot is its centralisation of several products, which can streamline sales and marketing operations and help to ensure all teams are on the same page. When marketing campaigns are informed by CRM data, they can be more effective. The HubSpot marketing hub enables ads to be optimised more accurately, thus increasing click-throughs and conversions. This kind of informed marketing choice can boost ROI and help you get the most from your marketing budget.

HubSpot is also big on community, with over 150 HubSpot User Groups (HUGs) around the world that enable HubSpot users to connect and share information and insights. HubSpot also hosts an annual conference in Boston, MA featuring hands-on workshops, new product announcements, demos, notable keynote speakers including Barack Obama, networking and more.

HubSpot also provides several options for automation, saving valuable time, and its AI assistant can help with content generation as well as offer data-driven actionable insights for further growth. HubSpot is not shy of tooting its own horn and claims that its customers attract 114% more website traffic, acquire 129% more leads, and close 55% more deals after 1 year of using HubSpot.

Such claims sound almost too good to be true – surely there must be some drawbacks to using HubSpot? Let’s take a look at some of the pros and cons of HubSpot.

What Are The Pros And Cons Of HubSpot?
Pro: Free Plan

This is a big one. HubSpot offers one of the most comprehensive free plans for CRM solutions, and many features are included in this free package. A million contacts can be added to the HubSpot free plan which is pretty generous when compared to other similar offerings. The free version is often a stepping stone to a paid HubSpot plan, as it allows potential paid customers to try out the CRM and other features before committing to a paid plan.
Con: No Customer Support on Free Plan

While paid HubSpot plans offer customer service, the free version does not. Users are directed to the HubSpot community or their collection of articles and guides in place of customer service, which can be off-putting for some. Their database of articles and community forums is comprehensive, but sometimes it’s necessary to have a conversation with an expert about a specific issue.
Pro: Conveniently Priced Bundles

It is possible to bundle HubSpot’s services to make them more affordable. Each ‘hub’ can be purchased individually or together at a discounted rate. The CRM Suite Starter includes the Marketing Hub Starter, Sales Hub Starter, Service Hub Starter, and others, and starts at a convenient £18 per month (billed annually). HubSpot’s built-in scalability means that its packages can grow alongside the business, and users can add extra features and functionality as they require them.
Con: Complicated Pricing Structure

Once we advance past the free and basic HubSpot packages, it does start to get expensive and complicated pretty fast. The free version has limited functionality, but so do the paid plans too. That generous-sounding million contacts sounds good until it becomes apparent that to include those contacts in an email marketing campaign, there is an extra cost. The Starter plan only includes 1000 marketing contacts, which a lot of businesses will burn through quickly. Having 10,000 marketing contacts requires a hefty investment in the Enterprise plan which starts at £3000 per month – ouch!

Businesses that begin with a Starter plan may find themselves having to upgrade not long after, and there is a significant price jump from £17 per month to an astounding £702 per month. There are other costs too – the Professional plan includes a ‘required, one-time Professional Onboarding for a fee of £2,600 which many customers would understandably baulk at.

Pro: Easy To Use, Intuitive Platform

Many HubSpot customers sing the praises of the sleek, visually appealing interface and intuitive way of working. Less training is usually needed with HubSpot when compared to other CRMs. The drag-and-drop format of content creation tools like landing pages and emails makes life easy, and every activity is logged automatically. Being able to have multiple windows of HubSpot open at once, as well as easy filter and search functions make for a very convenient piece of kit indeed.
Con: Poor Mobile App

While having a mobile version of HubSpot is useful, their app leaves a lot to be desired, with many reporting frequent crashes, incoming calls automatically ending a current call, and overall limited functionality. With the need for many businesses to operate on the go and away from the desk, having a decent mobile app is essential for their needs, meaning that HubSpot may not be the best choice.
Pro: Free Tools

Another feature that HubSpot fans rave about is the huge amount of cool, free features and tools that it offers. Things like blog idea generation, templates for all kinds of content, browser extensions and an email tracker make using HubSpot fun and add to the overall value of the software.
Con: Lots of Paid Add-Ons

HubSpot’s free tools are great, but are they only providing fluff without actual functionality? Some features and functionalities are only available in the paid tiers, which many may find frustrating. Any business that wants to use HubSpot for its marketing capabilities may end up quickly spending a small fortune or turning to other platforms to fulfil its marketing needs, which may defeat the purpose of an integrated CRM platform.

HubSpot is certainly popular and boasts a customer base of more than 194,000 businesses.  It can be a hugely beneficial way of connecting all your marketing and sales activity together with end to end data and simple website setup.  For B2B it is a strong play and more cost effective than some other leading marketing automation platforms.  It isn’t as complete or sophisticated as Salesforce and it does have its weaknesses but overall it is a strong choice for B2B businesses in the SME space.

8 Drawbacks of the HubSpot Marketing and Sales Platform

HubSpot vs EngageBay infographic

While people have their priorities aligned with their business interests, most CRM-related decisions come down to a few basic aspects — pricing, functionality, ease of use, and flexibility of opting in and out.

We’ve kept this blog post crisp and to the point — we’re only talking about the major pain points shared by HubSpot users here.

What are the drawbacks of HubSpot?

    HubSpot gets expensive really quickly
    It has annual contracts – no early termination
    Not very effective when you don’t use it as an all-in-one tool
    HubSpot does not offer A/B testing on lower plans
    You have to pay for additional technical support, and the mandatory HubSpot onboarding service is expensive
    There are a lot of HubSpot alternatives with similar features but better pricing — ideal for small businesses

1. It gets expensive — quickly

Let’s get this one out of the way since it’s so often a deal-breaker.

At a glance, what HubSpot offers might look affordable. In fact, you get the CRM for free, plus a few additional tools.

The HubSpot Starter plan is just $50 a month. However, if you’re a smaller business or otherwise working on a tighter budget, that’s where the good news ends.

HubSpot Pricing

HubSpot offers very limited features in its free version, so you’ll only be able to use it for the most basic things. Moreover, as your business grows, the prices you will need to pay will also rise, and quite steeply.

For instance, their Starter plan, costing $50/month, only includes 1,000 contacts ($18/month for new customers). If you go beyond that, you’ll have to subscribe to their Professional plan, which will allow you to add another 1,000 contacts to your database, but it’ll set you back $800 per month.

And, if you require more, you’ll have to get their Enterprise plan at $3,200 per month. Still, this will only offer you a maximum of 10,000 contacts.
Hubspot cons: Hubspot pricing
HubSpot CRM pricing

As your number of contacts grows (which it certainly will, as your business expands), then you’ll also have to pay more. It would seem reasonable if not for the steep rise in the package price every time you decide to go for an upgrade.

This might not be the most practical and affordable option for your business. In fact, it might not be doable at all. While it is very comprehensive and certainly impressive, HubSpot gets pricey and fast.

If you go to any software reviews platforms, you’ll find many users unhappy with HubSpot pricing, like this:
HubSpot-user-review
HubSpot CRM review
HubSpot’s 2024 pricing update explained

HubSpot’s already expensive plans have undergone a major change in 2024, increasing the pricing further. While we won’t go into detail, this table shows the new changes:
User requirement 	Previous pricing structure 	New pricing structure
Users requiring view-only access to reports, records, and other data 	Included in the free plan 	Now offered in the free, View-Only seat
Users requiring edit access to records and reports, email tracking, and other editable tasks 	Included in the free plan 	Now offered in the paid, Core seat
Users requiring sales and service-specific features 	Dedicated Sales and Service seat 	Dedicated Sales and Service seat

Don’t have time to read so much? Watch what Megan Grant has to say about HubSpot’s many pros and cons:

2. Their contracts aren’t flexible

While we’re on the topic of flexibility, here’s another one that many businesses frown on. Once you agree to a contract — like six or 12 months — you’re locked in, period. This is a major HubSpot con, especially for small businesses.

There are no early cancellations or refunds. If you don’t use your maximum number of contacts or realize you don’t like a specific tool, it doesn’t matter.

You will continue to be billed (even if it’s on a monthly basis) until you’ve fulfilled the entire contract cost.

While this might be all right for businesses whose strategies and processes fit well with HubSpot’s features, this isn’t practical for businesses that are still in more of a testing period.

If you decide to try out the platform and you realize that it’s not a good fit for your organization, you’ll still have to pay for it until your annual contract with HubSpot CRM ends.

hubspot marketing terms of service It’s because nobody wants that pressure.

Many (if not most) platforms are doing away with contracts completely.

While we won’t argue that HubSpot is a pretty remarkable marketing automation tool, you better be 100% certain that you’re in love with it before you drop that kind of money.
3. It’s difficult to use NOT as an all-in-one tool

If you want to experience HubSpot’s full benefits, running everything through its platform is the recommended course of action. This includes building your website in their own CMS.

If you’ve already built your website in another CMS like, say, WordPress, and if you’re quite satisfied with it (which a lot of businesses are), you can imagine the extra work this would entail.

The HubSpot CRM, inbound marketing automation, sales, and service tool is designed to be an all-in-one solution — and in terms of that specifically, it does a good job. However, and this is important, many businesses cannot run on one platform alone.

If you’re only wanting to use a few select features within HubSpot, you’re likely better off going elsewhere. Plain and simple, this isn’t the best way to use HubSpot.

Plus, you won’t be getting as much “bang for your buck.” There are more affordable alternatives.

If your business requires customization, then HubSpot’s lack of flexibility may present a problem for you. It’s quite overwhelmingly an “all or nothing” tool.

HubSpot-reviews
4. The templates are hard to modify

Using HubSpot email templates can be a bit complex to modify without knowledge of CSS. This will be one more hurdle you have to jump if you don’t always have access to someone with this skill set.

There are plenty of other alternatives offering a more user-friendly approach to building or editing email templates. This will save you time and money, and it puts you in the driver’s seat.

That’s exactly what we need from a platform, especially when we’re spending money on it.

5. There’s no A/B testing on lower packages

Split testing, or A/B testing, is an effective way to determine the best strategy for improving performance. It’s when you compare two different versions of something to determine which produces better results for your brand.

For instance, you might split-test two Facebook ads with different images or two landing pages with different headings.

Unfortunately, if you’re on HubSpot, you’ll have to purchase their Professional package, which starts at $800 per month, to take advantage of this feature.

This can’t be stressed enough. You must be testing these variables if you want to (a) get the most out of the tools that you’re paying for, and (b) be successful with your digital marketing strategy and your overall online presence.
6. Reporting is limited

For now, some of HubSpot’s reporting features aren’t as diverse or as detailed compared to a few of its competitors.

An example is its lack of segmented traffic reports, which would have the ability to give you information about the percentage of various kinds of traffic visiting your pages.

Furthermore, at present, it’s also unable to provide data on how mobile users navigate your page. This is incredibly important. Most people nowadays use their phones to browse websites.

If you’re not able to study and analyze this audience, you’re missing something huge.

These analytics and insights are going to be your best friend. They’re a must-have. If you’re not going to get them from using HubSpot CRM, a very large piece of the puzzle is missing.
7. You have to pay for additional technical support

Implementing and using certain features within HubSpot might be straightforward.

However, if your company requires continuous technical support, then you’re going to have to pay for it. HubSpot CRM charges for technical assistance whenever you need it.

HubSpot negative review
8. There are plenty of HubSpot marketing and sales features with cheaper alternatives

So much of this conversation is going to come down to the cost. Like we said in the very beginning, you have so many options. And here’s the bad news for the HubSpot CRM, sales, and marketing automation platforms.

There are more affordable options that will essentially do the same thing.

Let’s be honest: We’re all mindful of our budget. And why wouldn’t we be? Running a business isn’t cheap, and every dollar matters.

Understandably, you want to know that your money is being put to good use.

Here’s the thing. Some of HubSpot’s features have free or cheaper alternatives that are equal in functionality and quality.

Some businesses prefer these other options over HubSpot CRM because it enables them to pick and choose what they like best from various platforms.

As we mentioned earlier, because HubSpot is best utilized as an all-in-one tool, it’s much more difficult to ‘pick and choose’.

It’s simply not in your best interests.

So, What’s the Best Choice for You?

To be clear, the answer to this question is going to depend on what kind of business you’re operating. You should also consider your needs, goals, and pain points.

We’d be lying if we said that there’s a one-size-fits-all solution. There isn’t. Every tool out there in the market has its share of both pros and cons.

If you’re in need of a tool that will help you manage everything from start to finish, then yes — HubSpot CRM might be something to consider.

However, this isn’t the case for many of us.

If you realize the drawbacks of HubSpot CRM and you’re looking for a HubSpot alternative, here are just a few things that EngageBay is loved for.
1. More affordable pricing options

Pay monthly. Pay yearly and save a little cash. It’s up to you. Either way, you can get access to awesome CRM features for $65 a month.

EngageBay pricing

Important note: This is for the all-in-one package. You can opt for the individual marketing bay, CRM tool, or service tool with live chat. Flexibility is the name of our game, so pick whatever makes the most sense for you.

Here’s how EngageBay pricing compares with HubSpot:

Pricing comparison: EngageBay vs HubSpot

As you can see, the cost of HubSpot shoots up as your contacts increase, while EngageBay offers unlimited contacts for one low price of $119.99/month.
2. Get the split testing options you need

Under the Growth package, you’ll be able to run A/B testing for your email broadcasts and your landing pages.

Find the process that works best for your brand, so you can make sure that your money is working hard for you.

We’re here not just to give you access to our platform but also to help you improve your strategy — making EngageBay an excellent marketing tool and HubSpot alternative.

3. Grow your email list on your own terms

Even using just the free plan for marketing automation, you can start growing and nurturing your email list.

Email marketing is crucial because it’s got an ROI unparalleled by any other type of marketing.

We know that if you’re a smaller business or new to the game, paying for something like HubSpot CRM when you’re just beginning isn’t a feasible option. Do it with EngageBay for free and get the ball rolling.

The Ultimate List of HubSpot Pros and Cons

Updated January 5, 2024

A digital marketing plan is crucial for the success of any business. As a result, companies are always looking for ways to improve their marketing and often partner with companies with expertise in digital marketing.

As a HubSpot Agency, we deliver expert inbound marketing strategies and help businesses implement and optimize their HubSpot CRM platform.

If you have a business with an online presence, you will surely have heard of HubSpot. If by now you still ask the question, ""what is HubSpot"" then worry not! Today we break down the platform and how it helps small businesses market better for growth.

HubSpot is the ideal platform designed to scale up marketing and sales for your business with its reliable HubSpot features. Keep reading for our ultimate list of HubSpot pros and cons!

Pros and Cons text on notebook with many light bulbsWhat are the Pros and Cons of HubSpot?

As a HubSpot Diamond Agency, we are uniquely familiar with HubSpot's highs and lows.

We firmly believe that it's the ultimate marketing and sales solution for real estate businesses and other small businesses ready to grow. However, business owners need to understand the positives and negatives of any CRM before jumping in!

Here is our ultimate list of the pros and cons when using HubSpot.
4 of HubSpot's ""Pros""

We're big fans of HubSpot for sales teams and marketers, and here are just a few things we consider its top selling points for any business considering this CRM.
1. All-in-One Platform

Finding a reliable platform for your business is never easy and can be time-consuming. Sometimes you might not even find the exact platform that addresses your needs. Instead, you end up with several different systems that may or may not work well together to maintain your sales and marketing efforts.

Stop searching! HubSpot is an all-under-one-roof platform that makes it easier for sales and marketing teams to work together when growing your business.
2. Easy to Use

Marketing automation software can be complex, especially if you have little to no knowledge of technical systems. However, small businesses can rely on the HubSpot platform as it is relatively easy to use with drag-and-drop features and easy-to-follow navigations and systems.
3. Some Things Are Free

HubSpot offers its users a free version of the CRM to allow businesses easy access to many features if budget is an issue. However, to experience more of what HubSpot offers as your business grows, you'll need to choose one of the tiered paid HubSpot levels.
4. Access to Educational Resources

What could be better than finding a great marketing automation platform? Finding one that helps you learn!

HubSpot educates its users through various knowledge base articles, blogs, and courses through the free HubSpot Academy. When going through the HubSpot onboarding process, you'll have plenty of help to get up and running successfully.

Additionally, a HubSpot Agency like Geekly Media delivers training and resources to help companies implement the HubSpot software platform and get the most out of it.
4 of HubSpot's ""Cons""

While we could go on and on about HubSpot's best features, we realize it won't be the ideal solution for everyone. So here are four drawbacks that could influence your decision to choose something other than HubSpot's CRM.
1. Can Be Costly

Investing in HubSpot for your business can be costly. While the platform does offer some features for free and delivers different package options for different-sized budgets, you'll need to invest more money in the system to get to its best features as your business grows.

However, investing in a great platform is always better than wasting money on lower-cost resources that don't help you grow.
2. Template Customization Can Be Challenging

While HubSpot offers free templates for emails and landing pages, they might not be exactly what fits your needs. Users with a lack of knowledge in skill sets, such as CSS, may find it challenging to customize the templates.

However, a HubSpot Partner agency can help you build templates that fit your brand!
3. No Split Testing on Lower Packages

Split testing is vital for businesses to fine-tune marketing and sales efforts. Varying two versions of marketing ads, email subject lines, landing pages, and other aspects of your inbound marketing plan to determine which one might be appropriate for your brand audience is essential.

HubSpot offers these features only on higher-tiered packages, which might be limiting if your budget doesn't quite allow you to upgrade.
4. Using Advanced Features Might Require Help

When getting into automated workflows and building custom websites, some businesses find that they don't have the team members in-house with the right experience to maximize those features. However, working with an expert agency like Geekly Media can help you maximize every feature in your HubSpot portal, including Service Hub and the HubSpot CMS!

Why We Recommend HubSpot vs Salesforce

We've said it before, but we'll say it again: we believe HubSpot is the ideal solution for small businesses ready to streamline sales and marketing efforts for growth.

When comparing HubSpot and Salesforce, many businesses are finding that HubSpot offers distinct advantages that make it a better choice for their needs. HubSpot's user-friendly interface and straightforward implementation process make it more accessible to teams, allowing them to get started quickly.

Moreover, HubSpot's pricing structure tends to be more budget-friendly, particularly for smaller businesses. The platform also offers an all-in-one solution with features like marketing automation, CRM, and sales tools integrated seamlessly. With HubSpot's emphasis on inbound marketing and content creation, businesses can build a more holistic and customer-centric approach to their marketing and sales efforts, making it a compelling choice in the CRM and marketing automation.

We cannot stress enough that this platform is the best software to walk with you and grow your business. HubSpot's many features can drive your sales up with the right amount of effort!

While no system is perfect, HubSpot brings together ease of use and the ideal set of features to optimize marketing strategies, operations, and sales.
How Can HubSpot Help My Business?

While an inbound marketing strategy is an excellent way to scale up your business, it can be demanding, especially concerning time and finding the best techniques to implement.

Furthermore, having an internal team to work with sometimes is not enough. At other times you might even lack ideas on how to do digital marketing successfully.

We believe HubSpot is the ultimate solution to optimize operations and marketing to help your business grow. The platform makes inbound marketing efforts easier while consolidating various functions through reliable software. The key role that HubSpot plays in boosting sales for your business is through inbound marketing.
The HubSpot Ecosystem

HubSpot is a habitat for digital marketing efforts, CRM, and sales management. Since excellent customer interactions are the basis of business success, HubSpot gives companies the solution to consolidate, automate, and track customer interactions through their CRM software.

However, the platform does not stop there; with its five hubs (including HubSpot Operations Hub, Marketing Hub, and Sales Hub), HubSpot makes sales and marketing a breeze. As mentioned, the platform also offers insights that can help you with blogging and content marketing, social media marketing, and more.

Life is full of difficult decisions.

What should I be when I grow up? Where should I live? What marketing, sales, and service software should my business use?

Ok, that last one might be a bit of a stretch, but if you’re reading this, it’s probably a dilemma you know well.

As it becomes the business norm to make digital marketing, sales, and service initiatives entirely virtual, having a platform to organize and manage your activities, opportunities, and customers has never been more important.

We may be a tad biased as a HubSpot partner agency, but HubSpot has long been our marketing and CRM platform of choice and how we teach our clients to track their progress with our business-growth framework, They Ask, You Answer. We’ve stuck with it for almost a decade now because of how much the platform consistently grows and improves over time.

That being said, because the platform is always changing and improving, it is a lot to learn. So, we’ve done all the legwork for you!

In this guide, we’ll break down not only the pros and cons of each of the major hubs of HubSpot (marketing, sales, service) and the CMS, but also the pros and cons of using all of the hubs together.

    Chapter 6: Community & Support
    Chapter 7: Integrations

But before we get started, how do you know if HubSpot is right for your business to begin with?
Is HubSpot right for your business?

If you asked this question in 2010, HubSpot was a simple marketing software for small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and the answer would be much more straightforward.

In 2022, however, HubSpot is not only a robust digital marketing tool, but an entire platform of tools for your marketing, sales, and customer service teams.

With that being said, if you’ve landed on this article, you’re likely either looking at getting started with the entire platform (what HubSpot calls the Growth Suite), or just one of the hubs. That’s exactly how we’ve broken down this guide.

One very important note before we dive in: HubSpot’s subscription model is set up in tiers: Free, Starter, Professional, and Enterprise. Depending on what tier or hub you purchase, you will get access to different features and tools in the platform.

In this guide, we will be looking at more general pros and cons that are less specific to individual tiers, but it’s important to note that if you’re looking at the Free and Starter tiers of any of the hubs, you’re going to have fairly limited functionality, and the pros and cons in this article may not apply.

However, that doesn’t mean you should stop reading!

One of the biggest pros of HubSpot is its ability to grow with you, so it’s important to familiarize yourself with all of the capabilities of the platform, even if you won’t be using them right now.

Now that we’ve got that ironed out, let’s start with the pros and cons of using the entire Growth Suite (marketing, sales, and service hubs).
Chapter 1: HubSpot’s Growth Suite (and CRM)

The “Growth Suite” is how HubSpot refers to the ensemble of its three core hubs — Marketing, Sales, and Service — all of which are built onto the HubSpot CRM. (The CMS Hub, while still referred to as a “hub,” isn’t included here.)

Each hub has its own unique pros and cons when used independently of the other hubs, but there are also a number of pros and cons of using the entire suite of hubs in tandem with one another.

Because many users who start with a single hub end up growing into using the full Growth Suite (and you could certainly be one of them!), let’s start there.
Pro: Keeps all of your marketing, sales, and customer service data in one place

When you use the Growth Suite (marketing, sales, and service hubs all together), all of your marketing, sales, and customer service data live in one place — the CRM.

The CRM (Customer Relationship Management, or to put it even more simply, the database) houses all of your data collected from any of the HubSpot tools.

This may not seem like a big deal on the surface, but when you think about it…

Imagine being able to pass a contact from marketing to sales to customer service without ever having to sync information with another system or duplicate work in two different places.

Not only that, imagine being able to create a report that’s able to look at your customers across their entire customer journey — from the first time they landed on your website to their interactions with your support team.

The end result? The ability to make decisions and improvements based on real data instead of gut feelings.

Many marketing, sales, and service professionals spend hours and even days every year trying to pull, combine, and analyze data from disparate systems to report to their organization. With centralized customer data in the Growth Suite, you can do this type of reporting in minutes.

And while easier reporting internally is a huge win, the real win here is how you can use all of this centralized data to improve your customer experience over time.
Pro: An extensive App Marketplace to connect your other tools

Every business has unique processes and needs, which means that even if you’re primarily using a single platform, you’ll likely have multiple other tools or platforms to run your marketing, sales, and customer service from start to finish.

Thankfully, HubSpot has an entire ecosystem of integration partners that grows every day. The App Marketplace makes it easy to find what integrations are available, see what data and functionality are shared between systems, and quickly install the integration in your HubSpot portal.

HubSpot-App-Marketplace

For example, your marketing team may use Eventbrite to run online events. HubSpot isn’t an event marketing platform, but the Eventbrite integration takes just a couple of clicks to set up and will send all of your registrant and attendee information directly to your HubSpot portal.

This is the next level of keeping all of your data in one place — since you’ll likely always have to use some other tools, the ability to easily connect them to HubSpot allows you to keep even more data in one place, and leverage it for all of your processes.
Pro: HubSpot Academy

Have you ever signed up for a new tool, only to realize you have no idea how to use it, no idea where to start, and no one to ask?

With HubSpot, you’ll never have that problem.

HubSpot Academy has dozens of courses and certifications that not only help you learn how to use each piece of the platform, but will also help you get better educated on marketing, sales, and customer service.

They’ve got courses and lessons on things like inbound marketing, frictionless selling, customer journey mapping, and so much more, and they add and update content on a regular basis. You’ll likely never feel like you’re lost with nowhere to turn for help.
Pro: Can grow with you

One of my all-time favorite things about HubSpot is the ability for you to set up a free account and start playing on the platform immediately.

While I hesitate to use the catchphrase “Try before you buy,” since with a free HubSpot portal you get very limited access to tools and functionality, you do have the opportunity to get into the tool and get a feel for how it works and what it will look like for you to be using it on a regular basis.

This pro isn’t just about jumping into a free account to see if you like the platform, it’s about the ability for HubSpot to frictionlessly grow with you as your needs change. It’s scalable and only becomes more so with each update.

Many companies will start with HubSpot Professional because it has all of the initial functionality they need to start automating their processes and doing detailed reporting on them. (The Free and Starter packages do not include workflow automation and custom reporting.)

Eventually, when they run into limitations with complexity or team structure, those companies can quickly and easily upgrade any of their Hubs to Enterprise, which will simply un-gate additional tools and functionalities. This means your business can scale in many different ways without having to switch systems, which can take months to implement.

If you purchase the Growth Suite (Marketing, Sales, and Service Hubs), you’ll get an automatic 25% off standalone prices, which is another pro altogether.
Con: Not always the cheaper option

So how much does it actually cost? Learn all about HubSpot’s pricing model here.

And what about how much it costs compared to other competitors? Well, that’s where it gets tough. HubSpot has many different kinds of competitors depending on what you’re looking for.

Are you looking for just marketing automation tools, or for an entire end-to-end marketing, sales, and service platform?

For this reason, you’re going to have to do some due diligence on comparing pricing based on your business needs. While HubSpot’s flexible pricing structure is certainly a positive, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll be your cheapest option.

If you’re using the Marketing Hub, you’ll need to pay for contacts you’re marketing to by the thousand, meaning you could end up paying additional hundreds and even thousands of dollars on top of your subscription level.

For Sales and Service Hubs, you pay per user, which means if you have a large team, the cost can add up quickly. Again, this is a matter of doing your diligence to understand what HubSpot will cost you now, what it may cost you in the future, and what your other options are.

For example, if you’re looking at a more enterprise-focused solution like Salesforce Pardot versus HubSpot’s Growth Suite, you’ll generally find HubSpot is cheaper or comparable cost-wise. However, if you’re comparing HubSpot’s Growth Suite pricing to using multiple more SMB-focused platforms (like Mailchimp, Hootsuite, etc), you’ll find HubSpot to be much more costly.
Con: CRM not as “configurable” as other solutions

One of the biggest reasons that companies will decide to go with CRMs like Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, or SugarCRM over HubSpot is the ability to custom-build their instance to perfectly document and track their current processes and match their needs.

While HubSpot did release the Enterprise capability to create Custom Objects for the CRM, making it much more configurable than before, you are still limited in what functionality you can custom build into your portal (for example, you won’t be able to have a developer custom-build widgets into your portal).

However, before you write this off entirely as a con for your business, consider whether or not custom building a CRM will be as effective as using one that is built to be user-friendly and easy to learn.

Many companies spend months (and even years!) and thousands of dollars having custom CRMs built that perfectly capture every little piece of their process. The problem is, these systems often become so clunky, cumbersome, and outdated that no one actually uses them.

The reason that HubSpot is less configurable is so that when updates and improvements are made to the platform, it doesn’t break all of your customizations, it adds to them.

Also, since the release of Operations Hub in 2021, this has become even less of a con. With functionality like custom-coded workflow actions, data sync with other platforms and CRMs, and custom data sets, HubSpot now allows organizations to do more custom configuring of the HubSpot platform than ever before.
Chapter 2: Marketing Hub

HubSpot’s Marketing Hub has been around the longest and therefore has some of the most robust functionality of any of the platforms.

From creating conversion paths with calls-to-action, landing pages, and forms, to automating your email campaigns and managing your social and ads accounts, Marketing Hub has a vast amount of tools to help you execute your digital marketing strategy.
Pro: Collect data on all of your marketing efforts

HubSpot’s Marketing Hub was built to collect data on just about everything you do as a marketer.

You’ll be able to collect and use data on everything from who’s engaging with your emails and where your traffic is coming from to how pages on your website are performing and how many clicks your social media posts are getting.

You can use all of that data to segment your contact database in a way that allows you to personalize reporting, contextualize all of your marketing campaigns, and refine your overall strategy.

HubSpot-Marketing-Hub
Pro: Powerful segmentation options

Speaking of segmentation! You can use any data that’s being captured in your Marketing Hub portal to segment your contact database.

Create things like lists of contacts who have been engaged with your site recently for your sales team to do outreach to, or use information you’re collecting on your web forms to drop contacts into different nurturing campaigns based on specific criteria they meet.

Segmenting your database in this way allows you to create more personalized, contextual marketing campaigns without having to spend hours and hours pulling lists and manually creating segments.

Check out this HubSpot Academy lesson on “Creating a Contact Management and Segmentation Strategy” for more on what you can do in HubSpot!
Pro: Powerful automation

One of the reasons HubSpot was created in the first place was to help marketers spend less time doing menial tasks and more time doing strategic things that matter.

HubSpot’s Marketing Hub not only has a ton of little automation features across all of its tools (think: scheduling social media posts or getting a notification email when a form is submitted), but it also has an entire automation engine built on top of the CRM called Workflows.

You can use Workflows to automate just about anything — from lead qualification and handoff to email nurturing campaigns and internal notifications. If you master the Workflows tool, you’ll be able to create an efficient marketing engine that allows you to automate the menial things so you can focus on the big stuff.

I explain how to use them in detail in our free course Marketing Automation Mastery with HubSpot Workflows.
Pro: Easy lead generation

Most marketers looking into HubSpot’s Marketing Hub are looking to do one main thing: generate more leads. But how do you actually do this?

With any marketing software or tool, you need a way to capture contact information (most critically email addresses) so you can market to those people.

HubSpot makes that simple and easy with straightforward tools for capturing leads. Call-to-action buttons, drag-and-drop landing pages, and simple web forms that you can embed on any page of your website allow you to create end-to-end conversion paths.
Pro: Straightforward drag-and-drop emails and landing pages

Historically, one of the most frustrating parts about starting with a new marketing platform is the learning curve to be able to create new marketing assets.

What if you don’t know how to code HTML emails? What if you don’t have a developer in-house? Do you have to hire someone to build those things for you?

Not with Marketing Hub! HubSpot has an easy-to-use drag-and-drop builder for both creating emails and for creating landing pages.

This functionality coupled with the easy-to-use form builder we just mentioned allows non-technical marketers to create entire conversion paths with automated follow-up in minutes without touching any code.

HubSpot-Drag-and-Drop
Con: Paying for contacts (even with the “marketing contacts” option)

Earlier in this article, we mentioned pricing as one of the potential cons of HubSpot’s Growth Suite. That same con applies to the Marketing Hub individually, but there is also an additional piece of pricing that comes only with the Marketing Hub that can be a point of contention.

Unlike the Sales and Service Hubs, a subscription to HubSpot’s Marketing Hub comes with a required Contacts subscription. This means you must pay per 1,000 additional contacts in your portal (each tier comes with a certain amount of “free” contacts to start).

If you have a small database that you’re not looking to grow significantly, this likely won’t be an issue for you, but, if you have a high volume of contacts and you’re looking to continue generating more and more, you may find yourself paying thousands of extra dollars a year (or even a month!) just to store those contacts.

HubSpot did release the “Marketing Contacts” option, which allows you to only pay for the contacts you are actively marketing to. Depending on your database setup, this could save you from paying for contacts that you aren’t actively engaging with.
Con: Getting started takes time

Wait, didn’t you just mention that it’s quick and easy to get started creating assets and conversion paths in HubSpot?

Well, yes. It can be.

If you know exactly what you want to do with Marketing Hub, it really is quick and easy to get up and running and start using the platform right away, but if you’re new to the inbound methodology and to marketing automation technology, it can be easy to get lost in all of the different functions that are available to you.

Make sure you spend time taking HubSpot Academy’s Marketing Software Certification to understand what you can do in the platform and to start developing your strategy for how your business should be using it.
Con: Limited “templates” to help you get started with automation

When comparing HubSpot to other enterprise-level marketing tools, you may notice that most of HubSpot’s automation setup must be done completely from scratch.

While there are a few templates in Workflows, they only cover fairly basic automation setups like assigning new web leads or setting a contact’s lifecycle stage. This means if you don’t have in-depth knowledge of how to use Workflows, you may find it difficult to build out automation properly.
Chapter 3: Sales Hub

HubSpot’s Sales Hub is a “powerful sales CRM software to help teams close more deals, deepen relationships, and manage their pipeline more effectively.” And of course, what sales team doesn’t want that?

Individual sales reps can use the platform to manage their day-to-day activities with tools like deal pipelines, email templates, and detailed contact records, while sales managers can use the platform to do sales forecasting and create reports on how their teams are performing.
Pro: User interface and usability

This pro is by far the fan favorite of sales reps everywhere. When companies have custom-built or configured CRM platforms, there is often a lack of user-friendliness that keeps reps from going in and keeping information up-to-date. This lack of adoption inevitably leads to messy data and inaccurate reporting.

The clean and simple design of HubSpot’s deal board, contact and deal records, and reporting dashboards makes it easy to work in the platform day-in and day-out, leading to higher rep adoption of the tools, and ultimately great data and even better reporting.

HubSpot-Deals

Once your admins have set up your deal pipelines and processes, any savvy rep can go in and get started right away, and even tech-averse reps find it easy to learn after just a little bit of training.
Pro: Keep track of your entire sales process

Just say no to spreadsheets! Too many sales teams (including IMPACT’s up until a few years ago) use spreadsheets to track all of their sales opportunities and do their revenue forecasting.

With Sales Hub, you can set up your deal pipelines to keep track of the things that matter to you.
HubSpot-Deal-Pipeline

You can customize what information your sales reps have to input and when, and you can even set up automation when different activities happen around deals.

With the custom report builder, you can then build dashboard reports that show how effective your sales process is, from the highest level (ie. total closed-won revenue) to the smallest detail (things like the conversion rate from stage to stage for each individual rep).

This means your reps can spend less time updating spreadsheets, and more time working deals.
Pro: Tools for improved individual efficiency

Not only does Sales Hub have a great way to track and manage your deal pipeline, but it also has a whole bunch of tools that make sales reps’ day-to-day even easier.

With tools like email templates, sales sequences, meeting schedulers, and task queues, individual reps can manage their entire workflow right within the platform.

What’s more, sales managers are able to report on any sales activities happening on the rep level, meaning they can coach their reps based on real productivity data.
Con: While the basic setup is easy, setting things up effectively can be much more difficult

Just like with Marketing Hub, Sales Hub is easy to use, and many users can get started very quickly. However, in order to get your portal set up properly, you need to make sure you have your sales processes documented and have a clear understanding of how you want your pipelines and deal stages to be set up.

There is a lot you can customize — you can create custom deal properties based on your unique sales process, you can configure each user’s permissions based on what information you want them to be able to see, and you can customize what each team or rep sees when looking at deal records.

All of this opportunity for customization can also present an opportunity for chaos, so make sure you take the time to be strategic about your setup.

Here’s a great place to start (even if you’re using the Free tools!).
Chapter 4: Service Hub

The newest of the three major hubs, the Service Hub is a set of tools for managing and tracking your entire customer service process.

Ticket pipelines allow you to manage and track incoming inquiries in a single view, while the knowledge base and customer feedback surveys help you deliver an exceptional service experience.
Pro: Easy-to-use ticketing pipelines for managing inquiries

Just like the Sales Hub, HubSpot’s Service Hub has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for customer service reps to get up and running on the platform quickly.

With customizable ticket pipelines and statuses, you can easily keep track of any customer service or support inquiries that come in, and then report out on any of that data.

You’ll be able to see how many tickets each of your reps are closing for a given period of time, and do things like see which categories of tickets take the longest to resolve.
Pro: Team inbox

If your team uses a general support email address (i.e. support@company.com), you can connect that email to a HubSpot Inbox and manage all incoming inquiries as a team from one place.

You can have those incoming inquiries automatically made into tickets and round-robined to your reps to evenly distribute the ticket load.

What’s even better, if your team uses HubSpot’s live chat, those conversations will live in the same place, making it easy for your reps to manage all of their work in one place.

All of this ultimately enables your team to deliver the best end-to-end customer experience they can, while using real data to continuously improve the process.
Pro: Knowledge base to store support assets

If you have a customer support team, they likely have a whole lot of resources they pull from when answering customer questions.

Service Hub makes it quick and easy to set up a searchable Knowledge Base that your customers can reference before they submit a support ticket. This knowledge base can also be used in chatbots you set up.

Knowledge-Base

You’ll then be able to see what users are searching for and if they’re finding your articles helpful, helping you to prioritize which content to create and update as you go.
Pro: Follow up on your support processes with surveys

One way to know how effective your customer service team is this: look at speed and volume — how many tickets reps are closing and how fast that’s happening.

But that’s only helpful if you know that, when a ticket is closed, the customer’s problems are actually getting solved in the best way possible and they have no further questions.

A way to know how happy your customers are is that you have more and more deals closing and low churn, but that’s only helpful if you know that your customers are so happy they would refer their friends to you or stick around.

Enter: feedback surveys. Service Hub allows you to send CSAT, NPS, and CES surveys to your customers to get feedback on all different parts of the customer experience.

CSAT-Survey

(CSAT Survey Example)

No more assuming customers are happy or satisfied. Now you can not only know with real data, but also act on it!
Con: Survey functionality is currently limited

While You can do CES, NPS, or CSAT surveys and customize the wording, your flexibility with surveys pretty much stops there right now. In November 2020, there was a public beta for custom feedback surveys, but there are still some limitations.
Con: Limited features

Service Hub was released to the public in May of 2018. Because it’s the newest of the three main Hubs, that also means it’s the most basic.

If you need a more sophisticated customer service platform with robust features like a completely customizable knowledge base and survey tool, you’ll either need to look at a tool like Zendesk, or wait a year or two.

Service Hub has already come a long way in terms of functionality since it was released, and there are more updates on the horizon.
Chapter 5: CMS (Website) Hub

The CMS (content management system) Hub is what you’ll need if you want to build and host your entire website on HubSpot. There are two tiers — professional and enterprise.

CMS Hub Professional gives you everything you need to build a standard website (think: nicely designed pages with text and images only). CMS Hub Enterprise gives you added functionality to be able to build things like web app experiences, host additional brand domains, and have more control over governance.
Pro: Developer-friendly and marketer-friendly

In 2020, HubSpot released the new-and-improved CMS Hub, and the best thing about it? It’s made HubSpot’s CMS a unique combination of both robust developer features and a simple front-end experience for marketers.

When used to its fullest, developers can create sophisticated websites that blur the lines between website and web app, while at the same time making it easy for marketers to create and edit any page.

This means companies can save time and money by having their in-house teams make updates to website pages rather than needing developer resources for every single update. Plus, marketers can quickly execute campaigns that include new website pages without needing any outside resources.
Pro: Your website and your CRM are beautifully intertwined

When you’re using HubSpot’s Marketing Hub, having your site hosted on HubSpot and managed in your HubSpot portal makes life a lot easier.

You don’t need plugins or other tools to start capturing leads and engaging with them, it’s all built into the platform. With HubSpot’s tracking capabilities, you can see how leads are interacting with your site, what pages they’ve viewed, and other actions they’ve taken.

You can then optimize pages and the journey overall or even create personalized website experiences by using the contact data housed in the CRM in conjunction with the CMS’ dynamic content functionality.

Considering whether to put your website on HubSpot or WordPress? Check out this detailed comparison.
Con: Cost

With so many free website builders out there, the sticker shock for HubSpot is real. With plans starting at $240 per month, building and hosting your website on HubSpot is certainly an investment.

While no robust website host will ever be free (just because WordPress is technically free doesn’t mean the cost of plugins and other tools needed won’t add up!), you should look at using CMS Hub as a marketing and sales investment (after all, your website is your best salesperson!).

Websites are no longer just a virtual storefront, they’re what get your buyers 70% of the way through the buying decision before talking to one of your salespeople. When looked at in this way, making an ongoing financial investment in a great website platform just makes sense.
Chapter 6: Community and Support

With every major software implementation comes a unique set of challenges and decisions to make. So while it’s helpful to know the pros and cons that come with the software itself, there are also bigger-picture pros and cons that come with implementing and using tools for the long term.

That’s where community and support come in. To be successful with any major software investment, you’re going to need to leverage both the support that the platform provides, as well as other members of the user community to troubleshoot issues that come up and generate ideas around how to most effectively use the tool.
Pro: HubSpot Academy

We’ve talked about this, but it’s worth repeating here. HubSpot Academy is just downright awesome and is a huge benefit of using the tool.

It’s also worth noting that while HubSpot Academy has a large number of educational resources you can consume without being a HubSpot user, it also has an extensive Knowledge Base for users that has documentation around every tool and functionality. It’s Google for HubSpot, and it’s awesome.
Pro: HubSpot Community Forum

While HubSpot Academy’s resources are awesome, they are meant to be general and apply to as many people as possible.

The more you use HubSpot, however, the more you’ll realize there are a million different ways you can use the platform, and everyone that uses it likely does things slightly differently.

HubSpot’s Community Forum has an endless list of user questions, feature requests, and solutions from HubSpot employees and partners.

If you’ve got a question about whether or not you can do something in HubSpot, the Community Forum is your place to go. Oftentimes, you’ll find that someone else has had the exact same or a similar question, and there may already be a solution ready for you.
Pro: An extensive partner agency network

While HubSpot’s own support resources are great, they know there’s only so much they can do for their thousands and thousands of customers. That’s why they have a network of agency partners that work with HubSpot customers to find success with the platform. (Spoiler alert: we’re one!)

If you don’t have the in-house resources to execute your marketing, sales, customer service, and/or website strategies, partner agencies can help in a variety of ways, from training and education to implementation.
Pro: Customer success managers and teams (for pro and higher)

If you’re using a HubSpot Professional or Enterprise product, you’ll be assigned to either a Customer Success Manager or Customer Success Team at HubSpot that will stay connected with you on an ongoing basis to make sure you’re getting the most out of your investment.

Having this connection inside the proverbial orange walls means you’ll be able to get support directly from the source if you run into an issue that you just can’t solve.

This resource adds an additional layer of accountability to make sure you continue pushing toward your goals, rather than just trying to make sure you keep paying for the platform.
Con: High support volume can increase wait times

If you’re working on a high-priority task in HubSpot, and need some additional help from HubSpot Support, it can be hit or miss how quickly you’ll get help based on how much volume there is at your time of inquiry.

This can be frustrating if it keeps you from doing things like launching an email campaign on time. While many times you can get an answer from Support right away, don’t assume you always will be.
Chapter 7: Integrations

As we’ve mentioned previously, HubSpot does a lot, but it doesn’t do everything. What’s important is not that it does every single possible business function, but that it can talk to other tools you’re using to keep your processes running smoothly.

That’s where integrations come in.
Pro: HubSpot has hundreds of apps in its ecosystem

Over the last several years, HubSpot has opened up its API in a way that has allowed app developers to build easy-to-use integrations between HubSpot and other tools.

As mentioned previously, there are hundreds of integrations in the App Marketplace that can be set up in just a few clicks.

Integrating popular tools like Gmail, Outlook, Eventbrite, Slack, Zoom, Shopify, and SurveyMonkey is quick and easy, and there are more apps being added to the marketplace every day.
Con: Custom integrations can come at a price

The App Marketplace is great, but what if the tool I want to integrate with HubSpot isn’t in the App Marketplace? Can I still integrate them?

The answer is yes, you can, but it’ll have to be a custom-built integration, and these integrations can come at a high price and be cumbersome to manage and keep up-to-date.

While there are certainly many companies who have found success with custom integrations, if you want to go that direction you’ll need both time and money to invest in developing them.",https://www.impactplus.com/blog/the-ultimate-list-of-hubspot-pros-cons,HubSpot

HubSpot Marketing Hub Reviews: Real Users Report on the Pros and Cons
Written By Sean McGauley
November 16, 2023

Choosing marketing automation software for your business can be a daunting task. If you’ve ever done it, you’ve probably found yourself visiting countless review sites, sifting through thousands of user opinions trying to find your perfect solution.

Well, I’ve been there too and thought, “There must be a better way.” That’s why, for this review article, I thought we’d do something a little different to make the process easier for you if you’re considering the HubSpot Marketing Hub.

To do this, I took on the homework of digging through the user reviews and gathering the unfiltered experiences of marketers just like you. I focused on reviews from Software Advice, G2, and Gartner. Then, harnessing the power of AI, looked for patterns in the reviews to form the “unified” pros and cons shared by HubSpot users. That way, we can pull out the main likes and dislikes users are sharing, without having to read the 16,000+ combined reviews from all three sites.

In this article, we’re laying it all out for you.

User Review 3: ""Integration isn’t strong, and needs improvement. Setting up deals and dashboards is quite hard. Needs proper templates and training too."" (Source: Gartner)
2. Expensive Pricing:

HubSpot’s pricing is often seen as a drawback, particularly for small businesses on a tight budget.

User Review 1: ""Two things I wasn’t fond of. First, the price. It’s expensive and better suited to large corporations whereas we were working with small to medium-sized companies. Second, the email templates were minimal and not easily customizable. I ended up going into wireframes constantly to make simple layout changes."" (Source: Software Advice)

User Review 2: ""The downside is, of course, the price. You need to balance the benefits of all the automation that frees up your time versus coding it all yourself. However, not everyone needs an Enterprise level subscription and the different pricing tiers should help most smaller businesses with their needs without breaking the bank."" (Source: G2)

User Review 3: ""The horror is the price of the platform as it might not seem a lot but it increases a lot – Very expensive Biggest flaw of HubSpot."" (Source: Gartner)
3. Takes Time to Learn:

While the user experience with HubSpot is one of its strongest benefits, the large number of features and functionality require time to learn. Some users find that it takes time for their marketing teams to fully grasp and utilize its potential.

Users report HubSpot takes time to learn

Review 1: ""Clearly, the least about any solution implementation in a Startup or Company is the implementation phase. Is not easy to adapt to changes and of course adapting all the organization to a new platform takes time. The best way to do this phase in an organized manner is definitely a big issue in our path to success. We have to be organized, patient, and clear to the path we will be transiting. All members of the organization must be able to add value in these phases.""(Source: Software Advice)

Review 2: ""The Hubspot Marketing Hub is a great tool, but for some of our more traditional team members, adoption has been slow – and they struggle with using all of the valuable tools on this platform. Setting up some of the workflows and finding some of the reporting has been tricky even for me, so I can see how someone less tech-savvy could be struggling with some of the functionality and adoption."" (Source: G2)

User Review 3: ""It can be intimidating at first due to the many personalization items and a few confusing elements like the inbox. Also launching automation requires a specific skill set that cannot be underestimated."" (Source: Gartner)

Pros and Cons of HubSpot: Choosing the Right Tool
What is HubSpot?

If you’re reading this blog, you’ve already heard of HubSpot. But are you familiar with everything it has to offer? HubSpot is a cloud-based, software-as-a-service company that offers a full stack of marketing, sales, and service software for your business.

Based out of Boston, HubSpot has continued to grow over the last few years after going public in mid-2014. This has allowed HubSpot to expand its service offerings - keeping its customers, and their customers, as the main focus.

In this blog, we're diving into some HubSpot pros and cons specific to the many tools that HubSpot offers. We hope it helps you determine if HubSpot is a good fit for your eCommerce business!
HubSpot Tools

HubSpot can help B2B and B2C marketing strategies with three main tools: Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, and Service Hub. Each can be used separately, but they are most powerful when used together. HubSpot also offers a CRM, which is completely free with any package.

The Marketing Hub offers email marketing, marketing automation through workflows, social media monitoring and posting, analytics tracking and much more. The Sales Hub allows users to connect one-on-one with prospects through the use of sequences, meetings, playbooks and pipeline management. HubSpot’s most recent major roll-out is the Service Hub, which allows for ticketing support and shared inboxes within the tool.
The Evolution of Inbound Marketing

Much has changed since HubSpot was founded in 2005. The tool first featured only the Marketing Hub, which has since remained its flagship product. At this time, internet marketing was in its infancy. However, a fundamental shift began occurring in the industry.

Sales teams were growing frustrated calling on cold leads. Marketing teams were growing frustrated by sending out marketing messaging into a black hole. In 2010, co-founders Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Sha published a book called Inbound Marketing, about - you guessed it - how to grow your business through the Inbound Marketing methodology.

HubSpot’s new methodology for marketing strategies solved these frustrations. The inbound marketing methodology focuses on attracting the right visitors, converting them into leads, closing deals to make them customers and continuing to delight their customers.

HubSpot shifted the focus from the traditional sales funnel to a new concept: the flywheel. The flywheel keeps the customer at the center of all activity, where the funnel has the customers as an afterthought.

All of HubSpot’s products align to each area of the flywheel and connect all teams to work together to serve the customer - Marketing, Sales, and with the addition of the Service Hub, Customer Service.
Who is a Good Fit for HubSpot?

Marketing automation software is not one-size fits all. The needs of your business may be different than those of your competitor’s based on a variety of things like team size, business size and overall strategy. HubSpot works best for growing, mid-market and Enterprise businesses that are looking to increase the amount of leads they generate online.

Content creation and thoughtfully-mapped automation based around your business's specific user personas are at the core of the inbound marketing methodology. If you do not have the time, resources, or team to dedicate to creating fresh content, then this tool may not be for you. While HubSpot does require maintenance and strategy, it will pay dividends if you are willing to put in the time.
HubSpot Pros and Cons

Like any other software or product out there, there are pros and cons of HubSpot. We're outlining them below to help you determine if HubSpot is a great fit for your eCommerce business.
Marketing Tools

Pro - Marketing automation is arguably HubSpot’s most powerful tool. With HubSpot’s automation, you can give a team of 3 the power of a team of 15. Creating a more efficient marketing machine with less effort is the core of HubSpot’s practice.

Con - Setting up marketing automation with HubSpot is an investment. A simple newsletter sign-up auto-responder can be done in 20 minutes, but a proper marketing plan for nurturing leads takes more time and energy to set up.
Website CMS

Pro - In 2018, HubSpot released their CMS product, which could be purchased alone or as an add-on to any Hub tier. The CMS product is great for small sites that want to leverage the power of personalization in an easy-to-use and intuitive content management platform. If you’re already using HubSpot tools, it’s a no-brainer to consider.

Con - The HubSpot CMS offers everything you need for a basic site out of the box, including a free SSL authentication. However, the CMS only supports the same languages that the HubSpot CRM supports - which can create complexities for multinational businesses.
Service Hub

Pro - Did you know that 60% of consumers have stopped doing business with a brand because of a poor customer service experience?

The addition of the Service Hub to the HubSpot tech stack has been the biggest roll out since HubSpot’s inception. This tool has made it easier than ever for eCommerce-focused businesses to incorporate all aspects of marketing strategy into HubSpot.

The Service Hub includes a Help Desk with ticketing, shared inboxes so teams can tag-team support and a chat bot to automate help and route tickets. Best of all, this activity is stored in contact records, which gives full context of your customer’s relationship with your business.

Con - If you have complex needs for your Customer Service team, such as RMAs, you may need to look into custom integrations for Service Hub or consider alternate options.
Sales & CRM

Pro - There are many options out there to empower your sales team, including Salesforce vs HubSpot. HubSpot is the one tool that gives you the full picture of your customer’s interaction with your website, marketing materials and sales team.

Contact records in HubSpot hold all information about a customer’s interaction in one spot. This allows for quick pick up from one sales person to another and then from salesperson to customer service rep. The CRM feature is also free to start, which is a huge added bonus.

Con - If you’re operating with an enterprise team with complex team structures and many team members, HubSpot Sales Hub may not be the right tool for you. Although it can support businesses of any revenue size, businesses may experience difficulty after expanding to include a large number of staff on their sales teams.
Integrations

Pro - With over 800 integration options available in the marketplace, you can likely find something to fill almost any need when connecting HubSpot with your business. Salesforce, CallRail, Facebook Ads and Databox top the list, just to name a few. An Open API also allows for developers to build custom integrations.

Con - If you require a large amount of integrations, especially paid ones, costs can add up. However, HubSpot’s baseline functionality is robust enough, so this is not a frequent issue.
eCommerce

Pro - Integrating with your eCommerce platform and HubSpot takes connecting with your customers to the next level. By linking HubSpot with your eCommerce platform, you can take advantage of more-flexible abandoned cart emails, capture more leads and service your customers by answering their questions all in one place.

Con - eCommerce implementations with HubSpot typically require an integration. Fortunately, we’ve developed integrations for BigCommerce, HubSpot and Shopify that can help you sync order and customer data into your CRM.
Support

Pro - HubSpot’s support is top notch. Pro plans and above receive priority phone support in addition to the chat and email support available on the website. Response times average about 1 business day, but help is often offered immediately on chat.

HubSpot also does a phenomenal job of owning and updating their knowledge base. Try searching for just about any “How to do XYZ in HubSpot”, and the top result will be a relevant, helpful article from HubSpot.

Con - Honestly, we’re hard-pressed to find cons with HubSpot’s support. If your customization needs are heavy, it may take a little while to get routed to the right person that can help solve your problem. However overall, we give HubSpot support and responsiveness a 9.5/10.
Cost

Pro - Weighing the costs of your CRM tools might be your biggest influence when making a decision. HubSpot has several pricing structures based on the tier you choose.

As always, the base Hubspot CRM is free. They also offer packages for any size business and budget. Packages start at $50 per month and go up to $2,400 per month for Enterprise level. Your incremental costs are based on the number of contacts you keep in your system.

The Sales Hub pricing has an additional factor of price per seat, on top of a base price. The Pro level includes 5 seats, and you can pay incrementally for additional seats needed

Con - If you have a large sales team, the incremental cost per seat of each Sales Hub user can add up. Perform a cost analysis before making a decision to see where HubSpot pricing falls in line with other products while accounting for scaling your team’s growth.
Reporting

Pro - If you’re wondering how your customers are interacting with your email communication, HubSpot provides crystal clear reporting on that front.

Every email records sends, engagement, bounce rates, scan data and click through rates. You can attach several emails to a specific campaign, along with landing pages, blogs, CTAs, etc. to track overall engagement with your targeted marketing efforts.

Con - HubSpot continues to roll out improvements to their reporting tool, there is still room to grow. To cover our bases, we always simultaneously maintain Google Analytics accounts to verify client performance.


HubSpot Success Stories

HubSpot isn’t just for B2B lead generation businesses. As we already mentioned, HubSpot has robust resources for eCommerce brands looking to jump into inbound marketing.

Cutter & Buck is an American sportswear company based out of Seattle, WA (and a Groove Commerce client). After struggling with Pardot email marketing, they were looking for a more intuitive and powerful solution to meet their needs.

Their team aligned its HubSpot Marketing Hub roll out with a new site launch, and was able to make tremendous leaps in its marketing efforts. After increasing email efforts and configuring automation, sessions from email increased 33% YoY. Furthermore, their eCommerce conversion rate increased 45%, revenue increased 25% and the number of transactions increased 22% by implementing HubSpot and BigCommerce.
Conclusion

If you’re looking to implement an inbound marketing strategy for your business by using an all-in-one tool, then we highly suggest taking HubSpot for a test drive. If you want to evaluate HubSpot against its competitors, such as HubSpot vs Mailchimp or HubSpot vs Marketo, we recommend conducting research on your options before investing in a platform.

HubSpot For Your Sales And Marketing Alignment

Break the ice with HubSpot sales and marketing alignment and automation

What’s the worst that can happen to a business when it comes to achieving its growth objectives? The answer is – sales and marketing do not work in tandem, which can mean they are working at cross-purposes with one another or in silos.

McKinsey says that most businesses do not grow and between 2010 and 2019, only 1 in eight businesses achieved 10% growth.

As a business, you need to make a concerted effort to reduce all barriers that impact growth and misalignment between marketing and sales is one of them.
Importance of marketing and sales team working in alignment

There is a direct link between increased revenue and better marketing and sales alignment. This is because both teams do not work exclusively with each other and use each other’s strengths to ensure targeted messaging, achieve better quality leads, improve conversion rates and shorten the sales cycle.

The buying behaviour of both B2B and B2C customers is not set in stone. It constantly evolves and the marketing and sales strategies should evolve accordingly. It, therefore, becomes imperative that marketing and sales walk in step, with marketing enabling sales at each stage of the sales cycle to ensure leads are targeted in a personalised manner. The focus should be on creating the right story while nurturing deals which resonate with the lead/prospect and encourage purchase action. This can only happen with marketing and sales teams working well together.
Markers of marketing and sales non-alignment

Before you start acting on the misalignment or non-alignment of your sales marketing teams, it is essential to identify the signs that point to both teams not being on the same page. Let’s take a closer look at what these are:
MQL is King

If your marketing team evaluates its performance solely on the number of Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) it can achieve in a month, then there is an apparent misalignment with sales. According to Salesforce, only 13% of MQLs convert into Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs) and 6% turn into deals. The underlying challenge is that sales must convert leads into paying customers. So, it makes sense that your MQLs are such that they have a better chance of transforming into a Sales Qualified Lead, which can then translate into an opportunity, ending in a closed sale. If this doesn’t happen, low-quality leads are passed to sales and they find it near impossible to achieve favourable outcomes on those leads. This results in a clash between two teams critical of driving business growth.
Zero synergy

Have you been on those sales-marketing sync calls, realising there is no sync between the two teams? The call typically ends sourly, with team members accusing each other of not doing their jobs well. This happens because sync calls are the only time the teams interact with one another and key team members have little clarity on what the other side wants to achieve and why it wants to go on a specific path instead of another. When this happens, sales messaging does not appear like a natural progression of marketing messaging. Also, both departments are on the same page regarding lead scoring, which defines lead quality. There is no discussion on how a lead must be scored and how it needs to progress through the funnel, the kind of messaging it must be targeted with, and the nurturing process taking cognisance of the revenue from the lead.
It’s a competition

Are you trying to go one up over the sales or marketing teams? Are you always trying to show that the quality of the leads is bad or sales don’t know their job, impacting deal close rates? The situation sometimes gets so bad that the sales team starts taking its own campaign and content decisions, which can appear to conflict with the marketing campaigns. E.g., sales might execute a campaign for cold leads that sales had interacted with previously but have been cold for quite a while. Marketing might feel that such cold leads deserve to be woken up with personalised messaging under their purview, resulting in a conflict that can best be avoided.
Fixing the problem

There are no quick-fix solutions to fixing the sales and marketing problem and getting the teams to work seamlessly with one another. But it all begins with communication and listening to one another. Marketers must understand that their job at its core is not just branding but about becoming a key facilitator of achieving revenue targets; this means they should be able to pass on the highest quality leads to sales and make sure their campaigns can accelerate sales pipelines. Sales enablement is a crucial aspect of marketing; therefore, continuous meaningful interaction is the way forward.

Moreover, you should be able to identify clear, measurable outcomes that both departments can get behind. Typically, sales are under tremendous pressure to achieve their targets and marketers need to get an idea of these targets and work with the sales team to formulate targeted campaigns that can help achieve sales goals.

Also, it is imperative that both functions work with clean data, monitor results from campaigns, keep track of campaign iterations and ensure they stay on top of each other’s activities but do not interfere. This helps maintain much-needed transparency.
How does HubSpot help?

HubSpot is a platform that can be an ideal unifier for your sales and marketing efforts. It has two major components, the marketing hub and the sales hub:

    HubSpot helps you keep track of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) through dashboards that both sales and marketing can access. Users from marketing and sales are kept updated about campaign progress and results from the campaigns, which are updated in real-time. This ensures alignment of the parameters that matter to both sales and marketing and to the organisations as a whole.
    With HubSpot, the marketing content calendar and campaigns can be aligned with the revenue targets (dependent on sales). This tells the sales team that the marketing messaging is aligned with the sales outreach processes and the results can be monitored through the platform.
    Another critical area where HubSpot helps is by aligning lifecycle stages (marketing) and deal stages (sales). By using ‘Lead Status’, a customisable property within HubSpot CRM, marketing and sales can stay on top of any lead in the buying process, whether new, open, in-progress, open deal or unqualified. In addition, the status of the lead can be customised in a manner that makes more sense for both marketing and sales, e.g., ‘hot’, ‘warm’, ‘priority’, ‘low priority’ and so on. For example, if sales mark the lead as a top priority, marketing automatically knows the contact must be moved out of a nurturing campaign. This results in closer alignment.
    With HubSpot sales and marketing, you have access to unified data that can act as a single source of truth to analyse the success or failure of campaigns and show the way forward. There is scope for subjective arguments as data-driven analysis helps deliver objective conclusions. The alignment will be far smoother with sales and marketing using accurate data.

The idea behind using HubSpot for marketing and sales is to automate repetitive tasks, access and use accurate data to gain outcomes-focused insights and ensure that all marketing and sales activities work perfectly. Therefore, your focus must be to maximise the potential of this CRM tool to achieve the alignment you need.
The benefits of HubSpot marketing and sales Hub

Have you heard about smarketing?

It is a process that closely aligns sales with marketing, leveraging an integrated approach to achieve business goals.

With HubSpot, you are giving your marketing and sales teams the benefits of marketing and sales hubs to empower smarketing. You can access an advanced toolset that helps you collaborate better, thus reducing internal conflict and getting sales and marketing on the same page to achieve business goals using a consolidated sales and marketing strategy.

With HubSpot marketing and sales hubs, you benefit from the following:

    Readily available and always accessible meaningful data that facilitates data-driven decision-making to improve customer experiences, achieve pre-determined business outcomes and boost strategic visibility across marketing and sales.
    Brand messaging that is unified across sales and marketing enabling both functions to deliver personalised content across the customer journey that is best placed to deliver more value.
    Focused automation helps you create and execute automated outreach strategies through the various lifecycle and deal stages; this improves efficiency, productivity and accelerates go-to-market.
    Improved team unity as they get behind a single source of truth delivered through marketing and sales hubs, which ensures they can stay on top of the needs of customers.
    Real-time monitoring or marketing strategies to measure the ROI of all sales and marketing activities; getting a ringside view of success and failures helps iterate strategy on the go.

The most significant benefit of marketing and sales hubs is that they can align marketing and sales functions by centralising operations in a single solution.
Conclusion

When it comes to marketing and sales alignment, there are no halfway measures and you cannot take chances. This is where HubSpot enters the picture to help marketing and sales think together, action their thinking and achieve desired results.

37,Sales Marketing,"Our thoughts on Hubspot

Hubspot are an extremely popular, yet massively over-priced, marketing automation tool aimed at small businesses.

In our recent analysis of the marketing automation industry, we found that Hubspot own a 41.6% share of the small business automation software market, positioning them ahead of Keap as the market leaders.

Despite having an exceptionally well-designed product that has proven its value to over 30,000 small businesses, we generally would not recommend Hubspot. Why? Because there are even better alternatives (e.g. ActiveCampaign ) that cost 20x less.

While Hubspot’s starting price of $200/month may not seem like much, they’re notorious for price creep and lock-in contracts. While you may start by paying $200/mo, this can quickly end up in the thousands as you require additional contacts and features.

For comparison, where Hubspot charge $2,400/mo for 10k contacts (plus $5,000 for onboarding), Ontraport charge only $297/mo for 25k contacts (with no onboarding fee), and Hubspot charge just $70/mo for 10k contacts. Ultimately, whether or not Hubspot is going to be right for you business depends on the size of your list today, and where you expect it to be in 1, 3, and 5 years time.

Hubspot is one of the best designed and best marketed marketing automation tools, which explains why they have the highest number of customers among all marketing automation tools.

Hubspot’s Pros and Cons

Hubspot is easy to use, and well regarded in the market - but beware if you have a limited budget.
Pros

    The platform is easy to use:
    Hubspot have a beautifully designed product. Given the complexity of marketing automation software, they have done a great job of making it intuitive for small business owners with little or no coding ability.

    7-day free trial:
    Most marketing automation tools do a pretty bad job of mitigating the customer’s up-front risk (high setup fees, no free trials, and long contracts). While Hubspot do require high setup fees and a contract, they are one of the only tools to offer a free trial.

    Educating their users:
    Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Hubspot is the extent to which they invest in educating their customers. Their blog provides an exceptional place for business owners to learn about online marketing.

    A place for all your tools:
    Hubspot is convenient in that it has everything in one place. While you could get 99% of Hubspot’s functionality for free (or cheap) elsewhere, it’s handy having it all in one place.

Cons

    Requires a 12-month contract:
    Hubspot contracts are billed annually by default. Ultimately, marketing automation is something that you’re likely to use for many years, so this is not too big an issue. However, it would be preferable to have a rolling month-on-month contract.

    No A/B testing in their basic or PRO package:
    If you want to run split tests, you’re going to have to upgrade to their $2,400/month package. Given that A/B testing is one of their quickest and most effective ways to improve the performance of online campaigns, it seems odd that they wouldn’t offer this at lower levels to help small businesses generate better results (and additional revenue).

    Very steep price creep:
    While Hubspot do have a $200/month package, marketing automation and CRM integration are only offered at their $800/month package, which includes only 1,000 contacts. As your requirements and contacts grow, so does this cost (quite rapidly).

    Most tools offered by Hubspot are free elsewhere:
    Hubspot offers a well-designed set of tools, but there aren’t any silver bullets in there that couldn’t be found elsewhere for free or cheap.

    Technical support is paid:
    Implementing Hubspot is fairly straight-forward, but if you do require ongoing technical support, you’ll have to pay for it.

Hubspot’s Features Overview

Whilst not the biggest list on the market, Hubspot does offer a comprehensive list of feaures.

    Hubspot visual marketing automation:
    The visual editor works in real time to cover the most simple to the most complex of your customer journeys.

    Salesforce Integration:
    Strong two-way sync means you can keep all your data uptodate.

    Been using HubSpot for a few years now, it\'s grown fantastically well. With the new pricing, there\'s no cost for contacts as well. That\'s probably why it owns 40+% of the SME market.

The martech tools are spot on. One of the issues is that it\'s too easy to edit, needs good practices to setup to stop it from becoming a frankensystem.

Hubspot disappointment

20/02/2019


    We are in Hubspot's startup program, with a discounted rate of about $650/month. The surprise is that the pages constructed using their templates are not acceptable. There are CSS errors and presentation problems that require us to pull engineers out of their normal workflow (billed at $150-225/hour) and get them to work on the spaghetti code offered by Hubspot.

We can't use any of their templates without intervention by either their tech support or our very busy engineers.

Here's an example from yesterday. A blog article template has social media sharing buttons above the main body of text. The buttons are out of alignment.

How are we supposed to be taken seriously by very demanding clientele if we can't get the basics right? In order to serve our customers, we need to demonstrate ""best practices"" in everything we do. Hubspot is a patchwork of less than excellent mechanisms cobbled together to satisfy small business marketing needs. Not a good match for us.

What Hubspot does extremely well is create content for their own marketing. They have high domain authority for marketing automation. They've got the wonderful high touch customer service during the trial period. But the actual day-to-day implementation is far less than expected.

To their credit, they also have managed to build partnerships and half competent integrations with other vendors in the marketing ecosystem. For example, when we talk to data suppliers like ZoomInfo or identity resolution vendors, integration with Hubspot is usually straightforward.

I'll add that navigation of their dashboard is far less than intuitive. One of our interns has spent 50+ hours learning Hubspot basics so she could show the rest of us how to us it. Don't let anyone tell you that the UX is seamless or friction free!

Unless things radically change we will bail out.

In sum, Hubspot is a clear case of overpromise and underdeliver. It's adequate but far from excellent.

Our verdict on Hubspot

Hubspot are the most popular marketing automation tool for small businesses. While their product is excellent, you do need to be aware of price creep, as Hubspot’s pricing gets expensive as you require additional contacts.",https://www.marketingautomationinsider.com/hubspot/,HubSpot

Matthew Deal

As a product, HubSpot can seem a little confusing. While HubSpot is both a company and product (in the same way you refer to Q-tips as Q-tips versus “cotton swabs"").

HubSpot is made up of six different products, each of which is referred to as HubSpot “Hubs”:

    HubSpot Marketing Hub
    HubSpot Sales Hub
    HubSpot Service Hub
    HubSpot Content Hub
    HubSpot Operations Hub
    HubSpot Commerce Hub

All of these are helpful for streamlining your business's procedures into one integrated space. That's why using HubSpot and HubSpot CRM is vital to your company’s success. But what is the difference between HubSpot and HubSpot CRM?
What is HubSpot?

HubSpot, at its core, is a powerful Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system.

It's this CRM foundation that allows HubSpot to integrate and streamline a business's digital marketing and sales activities into a single, unified space. Much like the original description of HubSpot being an 'all-inclusive' software program, this CRM foundation serves a similar purpose. It's the bedrock upon which businesses can build and customize their use of HubSpot's various 'Hubs', each catering to unique aspects of their needs.

The CRM isn't just a part of HubSpot—it's the heart of it. All of HubSpot's tools and services, from marketing to sales to service, are built on this foundation. This ensures that no matter which 'Hubs' a business chooses to utilize, they'll work together in perfect harmony, driven by the centralized customer data and insights provided by the CRM. This integrated approach, rooted in the power of the CRM, is what makes HubSpot such a dynamic and versatile tool for managing and growing your business.

Generally speaking, many companies combine multiple HubSpot based on their business needs (which subsequently can impact pricing options).

Each HubSpot “hub” has a specific focus area: sales, marketing, customer service, or operations.
Who Uses HubSpot?

If you’re running a business and have a marketing or sales team, you should be using HubSpot. HubSpot can help you do anything and everything – that’s the appeal.

Examples of common HubSpot users include:

    Marketing analysts who want to optimize their automation campaigns.
    Customer service specialists who are looking to answer customer questions and complaints.
    Account executives who want to chase down hot and warm leads.

A Note On Contacts

Contacts are a key part of any CRM, including contacts in HubSpot. They are the main focus because they represent the people who interact with your business, such as potential customers or existing clients.

We highlight contacts because they're a simple way to understand how data is managed in CRMs. In HubSpot, contacts are the center of all customer interactions, helping you keep track of everyone who engages with your business in any way.

For more information and to dig into this, check out our blog post on what a contact is in HubSpot.
Marketing Hub

Marketing Hub is the perfect platform for growing traffic and leads and includes powerful features like marketing automation and email marketing.
Hubspot's Marketing Hub lets you monitor marketing campaigns.



You can examine how your Google, Facebook, and other paid ads perform. You and your team can also view, analyze, and filter your campaign data to see how well it's functioning.

You can follow your social media activity within the platform by linking all your accounts. This lets you analyze your data and track your customers' engagement. What's more, you can engage with customers directly from HubSpot, and there is a HubSpot mobile app.

Writing an email is easy and quick with HubSpot's templates. You and your team can track emails and organize them in one place.

Send an email now or schedule it for another time. You will keep your customer service at its best.

Every company needs a website, and HubSpot helps you keep yours organized. Marketing Hub assists you with building your landing pages, as they remain central to inbound marketing. Use a template or customize your own, and manage various campaigns all at once, all in the same place.

Service Hub

Service Hub has many robust marketing tools to aid you and your team in mastering customer service (the focus of Service Hub). Users can track customer tickets and stay organized and efficient to enhance customer service.
HubSpot's Service Hub focuses on customer service.



Analyze productivity reports to find out how your team is performing. Review how each representative responds and how long it takes them to answer. It will improve your business' response times and processes.

The Live Chat service allows you and your customers to connect quickly. Additionally, conversational chatbots offer support, so your customers can get answers even when you're sleeping.

These features can help you keep customers happy, and happy customers are the most loyal customers!

Creating shared inboxes helps bring every employee on the same page. Scheduling emails gives you peace of mind knowing the task is complete. Furthermore, creating ""Snippets"" means that your frequently-used answers convert to ready-to-use text.

It saves time because no one has to reinvent the wheel.

The meeting planner sets up your meetings and sends contacts a link to your page, which contains a calendar that shows your availability. Additionally, you can track your best-performing emails and turn them into a template for your whole team to utilize.
Service Hub’s ticket system helps you manage customer support requests.



You enhance customer service with more sales tools, and your team member's communication methods stay ""on brand.""

Another powerful feature is Service Hub's Knowledge Base, which allows you to build an all-inclusive information resource centered around your products or services. Acting as a self-help hub for your customers, the Knowledge Base ensures they find answers to their questions without delay. It's a win-win situation - your customer service team sees fewer routine queries, and your customers enjoy swift, self-serve solutions.

Furthermore, the Knowledge Base is completely adjustable to your liking. This means you can mold its content and layout to align perfectly with your brand and customer requirements. This flexibility allows you to create a resource that not only meets your customers' needs but also represents your brand identity effectively.""
Operations Hub

Operations Hub is what you need if you want your business operations automated. The platform provides everything you need to connect your customer data to your apps.

You may already use many business-related apps, but having them all on one platform makes life easier. Additionally, this tool makes syncing data (past and future) easy and works in real-time.

Once again, HubSpot saves you time.

The CRM tool allows you to personalize customer service. It syncs your data, automates it, and helps you with retention. It fixes problems for which you may never have thought to look.

The Operations Hub boosts your operating capacity while allowing you to customize your data. It garners data reports that can give you a look at each aspect of your operations. Examine reports individually or as a team.
Content Hub

HubSpot's Content Hub makes creating and managing your website feel effortless. Like all HubSpot products do, it seamlessly integrates with the other HubSpot's robust marketing tools to make running your business less stressful.

Furthermore, it is easy to use and enables your website to operate quickly and securely while simultaneously expanding your business.

HubSpot provides unique themes and editing capabilities for building your dream website. If you prefer to design your website from scratch, you can hand-code each element (or use HubSpot's drag-and-drop website building features). If not, use one of the many themes and templates available through Content Hub.

This product is unique when it comes to integrating data and analytics. It allows you access to more detailed and accurate information about your marketing and sales performance. Combine that with its speed and security, and you have a website that your customers will adore.
Sales Hub

Using the Sales Hub enterprise is the wisest way to guarantee your company grows. While completing the daily duties of running a business, you and your team can also

tailor the process of your sales and marketing service. You can suit your customers' needs with efficiency and focus.
HubSpot Sales Hub is focused on tracking sales team activity and process.



Additionally, having all of your data on one platform will help your team master the sales process. Using data collected from the platform, your sales team can track account progress in real-time to better plan and collaborate.

The HubSpot Sales Hub also makes setting up calls or emails to potential customers painless. Automating emails without sacrificing personalization is achievable and manageable. Missing a lead or letting a valuable customer slip through the cracks is impossible.

Your team will have everything they need to concentrate on the data-driven tasks that will support your company's growth. They can stay relevant in your business industry while finding leads and closing deals.
What is a CRM and Why it is Important

CRM stands for customer relationship management. For digital marketers, CRM often is a significant pain point. However, having outstanding CRM software at your disposal is like having a superhuman genius working alongside you.

USA News and World Report writer Brandi Johnson explains it best. ""At its core, a CRM is simply a database that helps a company keep track of all of the details about prospects and customers.""

CRM systems offer easy-to-use interfaces and workflows. Since customers stand as one of the most vital business assets, including a  CRM in your company strategy is an essential move.

You and your team can update and customize all of the information about your clients with a few clicks. Each piece of customer information lives under one platform. Therefore, keeping track of your clients' needs is easier than ever before.

""Having solid relationships with your clients is important if you want to build a stable and successful business,"" according to Finances Online. Building better customer relationships will never go out of style. Going back to basics with customer relations is the way to grow your business.

Customers remain loyal to the businesses with the best customer service. And, Business News Daily reports, ""CRM is one of the world's fastest-growing industries, expected to grow at a rate of 14% between 2021 and 2027?""

Customer satisfaction means that the traffic you want to see on your site will flourish, and your business will prosper as well.
What Does HubSpot CRM Do and Why You Should Use It

HubSpot CRM integrates with many other systems, and its accessibility and ease of use remain the best. Melissa Randall from Lean Labs explains this.

Instead of including a bunch of features that most people don't use or understand, [HubSpot CRM stays] focused on the essential components that make up a good quality software for managing customer relationships.

To break it down: HubSpot is now known as HubSpot CRM. The company began with the name HubSpot, offering customer relationship management, and currently, it consists of the many platforms described above.

Today, HubSpot CRM is a leading customer relationship management company. HubSpot's free CRM tool pairs with all of HubSpot's platforms and is one of the easiest CRMs to use.

Every customer-facing team can use it, from marketing to sales and customer service. Upon signing up with HubSpot CRM, your account will come with a set of specific CRM objects, such as contacts, companies, and deals.

However, you can create custom objects to represent and organize your CRM data according to your company's needs.

Using HubSpot's free customer management tool gives your team a running start in growing your business. And upgrading to the professional and enterprise bundles (depending on your company's size and needs) makes company growth a reality.

The process of honing customer relationships can be pretty complex. Using HubSpot CRM will assist you in handling your client relationships more effectively and efficiently.

When you use HubSpot CRM, you remain relevant and successful.
What Type of Software is HubSpot CRM

HubSpot CRM is a cloud-based software program. Not only does using a cloud-based application save you money, but it also saves you time. It can make your customers' experience more personable.
Hubspot let's you track all your contact (and their activity) in a single place.



Essentially, you house all of your contacts in one place. Check your email, write an email using a template, and track the emails written. While writing an email, you can see the

customer's information in the sidebar of your screen, which allows you to connect relevantly to the buyer.

It doesn't create duplicate contacts once a contact's information is in the system either.

Moreover, you can filter your contacts in many ways and customize your view. You can use the ""@"" sign if you want to mention a coworker. Use this function to work collaboratively as well.
Why is HubSpot CRM so Important?

Filter companies by pages, and when making a deal with a company or client, give the page a name and save it. This way, you can see where your sales are going.

HubSpot CRM keeps you at the top of the game and, frankly, HubSpot works. It manages a plethora of your data so that you can focus on what is most important: the customer experience.

Every business values customer service, but now it's more important than ever. The most efficient way to manage your customers is with a customer relationship management system. Having a single integrated system for your business's procedures is essential to your organization's success.

Your business needs HubSpot CRM and its platforms to facilitate growth and support your team. Your willingness to produce change and give your team the best platforms available, helping them be as successful as possible, will determine how well your business thrives.
How Much Does HubSpot Cost

Good news: HubSpot CRM includes 23 free features so you can get your feet wet and decide if this is the tool for you. You can test out tools like ad management, deal pipeline, app marketplace integrations, ticketing, email marketing, and more.

These free features are limited though. You’ll only be able to access basic analytics.

If you’re ready to commit, HubSpot paid plans are priced according to what hub you decide to use. This plan offers monthly or upfront pricing models. Prices vary depending on how many Hubs/suites (like the CMS Hub, Sales Hub, etc.) you need, the type of Hub, and if you’re using the tool at either the Starter, Professional, or Enterprise scale.

    Starter: Includes 1 seat and 1,000 contacts.
    Professional: Number of seats included depends on your Hub. Includes 2,000 marketing contacts. You can add additional seats for $50/month.
    Enterprise: Number of seats included depends on your chosen Hub. Includes 10,000 marketing contacts. You can add additional seats for $75/month.

Here’s a breakdown of what the prices would look like for each Hub per month:
Hub 	Starter 	Professional 	Enterprise
Marketing 	$15/Month Per Seat

$800/Month
Includes 3 seats


$3,600/Month
Includes 5 seats
Sales 	$20/Month Per Seat 	$100/Month Per Seat 	$150/Month Per Seat
Service 	$20/Month Per Seat 	$100/Month Per Seat 	$130/Month Per Seat
Content 	$15/Month Per Seat

$450/Month

$1,500/Month

Operations 	$20/Month Per Seat 	$800/Month Per Seat 	$2,000/Month Per Seat
Commerce 	Free 	Pay as you go model

The Commerce Hub operates on a pay as you go mode, where you're only charged for any fees or transactions made via the Commerce Hub features.

You can always add more users or contacts for additional costs.
A Note On HubSpot Pricing

Many people are surprised to find out that you can actually negotiate on your HubSpot contact. At Vaulted, because we're an official HubSpot Partner, we have some sway on pricing and may be able to save you a significant amount on your HubSpot purchase.
Is HubSpot Worth It?

We’re a little biased, but in our opinion as long-term HubSpot users, yes, HubSpot is 100% worth it.

HubSpot has all of the tools you need to make a sale in one place. It makes it easy for your marketing and sales team to stay informed. You can do anything from attract leads by building content, engage leads with regular emails, or make the sale. And since you can do that all in one tool, it’s easy to track and attribute credit to the correct channels.

It also helps that HubSpot differs from its competitor because of its free offerings. You can test out its Hubs (to a limited capacity) to triple check that this is the best choice for your team.

HubSpot can be on the pricier side for SMB, but if you’re looking to invest in your team and marketing and sales funnel, you can’t go wrong.",https://vaulted.co/blog/what-is-hubspot,HubSpot

semrush

Definition:

SemRush is one of the most widely used SEO tools by digital marketers. It allows you to perform SEO and SEM audits of a web page and those of its competition through different tools. It is mainly used to monitor organic positioning, although it also has functions to optimize PPC campaigns, content and management of social networks, as well as the link building strategy.

For its utilities and the type of clients it targets, large companies and marketing agencies especially, it competes with other SEO audit platforms such as Sistrix or Ahrefs.

    1 How SEMrush came about
    2 The main functions of SEMrush
    3 What SEMrush allows you to do for free
    4 Tutorial de SEMrush

How SEMrush came about

SEMrush was created in 2008 by SEO and information technology experts Oleg Shchegolev and Dmitry Melnikov as a project to “make online competition fair and transparent,” as it explains on its own website. Its origin is in SEOquake,a free extension for Google Chrome that allows basic SEO analysis and that still exists today, although its founders explain that with a very different objective than its SEMrush.

The latter currently has more than three million users worldwide and analyzes searches made in more than 150 countries, including Spain.


The main functions of SEMrush

SEMrush is a platform in constant update, so its tools are renewed periodically. Its menu is structured in the following blocks of tools: SEO, advertising, social networks, content and analysis of the competition.

Within the SEO section, through the main search bar it is possible to analyze:

    A domain (www.arimetrics.com)
    A keyword (‘digital marketing agency’)
    A specific URL (https://www.arimetrics.com/servicios/agencia-seo-posicionamiento-web-buscadores).

In SEO there are a number of subsections: competitor research (analyzes a web page individually and with respect to its competition), keyword research, backlink generation, ranking tracking and ON Page SEO (more technical).

One of the main advantages of SEMrush is that it allows you to store projects (according to the contracted plan), very useful in case you work on many web pages at the same time. Through the dashboard or panel of each project it is very easy to observe the evolution of the keywords and the possibilities of improving SEO On Page. You can connect with other tools like Google Analytics and major social networks to get all the metrics on the same platform.


What SEMrush allows you to do for free

Using the free version allows you to discover your possibilities by working as a trial before deciding whether to hire one of the paid plans. As usual in this type of platform, the functionalities without cost are very limited. For example, you can only do 10 searches a day and see the first results.

There are three payment plans, whose prices range from $ 99 to $ 399 per month (Pro, Guru and Business). If the payment is made on an annual basis, all plans have a small discount. There is also a customized version according to the needs of the user called Enterprise. SEMrush does not require permanence and allows you to change the contracted plan at any time.


Tutorial de SEMrush

On the Internet you can find a multitude of SEMrush tutorials to get the most out of it, use strategies, discover tricks, etc. Many of them are videos published by the best known experts in digital marketing and, specifically, in SEO.

The website blog includes many of these demos on how to use SEMrush, even segmented by theme: SEMrush for SEO, SEMrush for eCommerce, SEMrush for PPC, etc.",https://www.arimetrics.com/en/digital-glossary/semrush,SemRush

What is Semrush? Key Features of Semrush

With the CPC Map, you can delve deeper into the regional CPC rates and more, and dig up useful data for A/B testing, just in case you wish to try pulling some paid traffic to your website on a dry day.


Semrush Pricing – Is it Worth Your Money?

Is Semrush worth the money? The answer is Yes as well as No.

Semrush is worth the money if

    You are serious about your online business and want to grow it
    Most of your website traffic comes organically from search engines and you cannot compromise losing on high-quality organic traffic that converts to sales or revenue.
    Your websites already generate some revenue and you want to grow the revenue through strategic measures.
    You are facing steep competition and want to be ahead of the curve.
    You need new ideas to open new channels for your business and acquire customers in different categories, segments, geographies and want to understand their intent better.

Semrush is not worth the money if

    You have just started out and tinkered with a new business idea or a blog.
    You have little to no experience in any online business, especially the one which heavily depends on content for customer acquisition or lead generation.
    You have no content in your website or blog, you are learning the ropes. By no content, I mean very less content (e.g less than 50 posts).
    You are satisfied with Free keyword research tools and don’t want advanced analysis or cutting edge details about your competition.
    You don’t know what SEO is and you are planning to outsource the work to an agency.

Semrush offers 4 plans, which can be billed either on a monthly or on an annual basis.

To get the best deal, we recommend you always choose to pay on an annual basis. Yes, it costs more one time but you will be saving money at the end of the year, compared to the monthly plan.

Let us now take a dig at each of these 4 plans and figure out its suitability for various set-ups.

Semrush Pricing - Pro Plan
Semrush Pro Plan

The most basic plan by Semrush is the pro plan which is suitable for Freelancers and solo business owners. The number of projects under this plan is limited to 5 only, and that it isn’t quite feasible for seasoned freelancers who work with tens, if not hundreds of clients. However, this is the ideal plan for an individual business owner who wants to use Semrush to optimize his own website, and not work for clients on SEO projects. Blog owners who wish to do their own SEO analysis and have just ventured into the website business can experiment with it.

The Pro Plan costs $99 a month (billed monthly) and $996 (billed yearly)

You should take the Pro plan if

    Your website makes some revenue and you can afford to invest $99 a month to get access to invaluable data, which in turn can increase the revenue of your online business.
    You do not work for clients on SEO projects and will never have to monitor hundreds of competing websites for a specific brand or business
    You are okay to be limited to 5 projects.
    You are okay not to have access to historical data.
    You will not need to track more than 500 keywords on a daily basis
    You won’t need branded or white-label PDF reports to share with clients.
    You will not need to crawl more than 1,00,000 URL’s of your sites by Semrush
    You will be the only user and won’t need to add additional users to your account.

Semrush Guru Plan

If you have more than 5 websites under your belt, you may consider investing in the Guru plan by Semrush, which lets you manage and execute 50 projects, and also segregate the source of traffic based on the devices used by the users. This lets you plan the right content strategy because you can then focus on the length and structure of your content. We consider this plan to be far more beneficial than the pro plan for freelancers involved in digital marketing.

Semrush Guru Plan costs $199 a month (billed monthly) and $1992 (billed yearly)

You should take the Guru plan if

    You own a digital marketing agency and have parallel projects running all day long, you cannot be restricted with only 5 projects.
    You need historical data, so you can analyze the trends of keywords, niches and see what worked in the past but is not working now.
    You want branded PDF reports to share with your clients and companies you do consulting with and do not want to use Semrush’s default branding.

Business and Enterprise Plans

The Business and Enterprise plans are suitable for larger digital marketing agencies, eCommerce sites with huge revenues and turnovers, large corporations and enterprises. If budget isn’t a constraint then we strongly recommend the Business plan for all digital marketing firms with 10 or more clients. Enterprises and larger companies can talk with Semrush team to decide a custom pricing for Semrush, according to their needs.

Semrush Business Plan costs $399 a month (billed monthly) and $3996 (billed yearly).

You should take the business or enterprise plan of Semrush if

    Budget is not a constraint for you and you want no limits and restrictions on your projects or data
    API access and integration with your application software
    Google Data studio reports, scheduling PDF reports, and white labeling

Pros and Cons of Using Semrush

Every tool will have some positives and some negatives. Semrush is no exception, it is indeed a very useful tool with lots of features but it has its limitations as well which I must mention to you.

Given below I have listed some of the benefits and limitations of Semrush but I do feel the benefits strongly outweighs the cons
Pros        Cons
Intensive keyword research

Gives thorough and comprehensive keyword analysis and lets you pick the right ones according to your niche.
        Not a friendly User Interface

The user interface is not very user-friendly and requires a certain degree of understanding and experience. In other words, the user interface is a little too technical for beginners but this can be easily fixed with a quick course in SEO and digital marketing.
Reasonably priced

Except for the Pro plan by Semrush, all the plans are reasonably priced for small and midsize businesses.
        A disadvantage in case of subsequent logging

A single Semrush login can be used by one user only, but just in case you share it with someone else and that person subsequently logs in with the same account then the user who logged in earlier loses access. It would help if Semrush fixes this glitch and ensures that the subsequent user is warned of unauthorized access or something similar.
Provides detailed information about Visitors
Semrush lets you take a peep into the demographics of your users, such as age, gender, the location which helps you to offer the right products or services to them.        Fear Factor

Some Semrush users complain that Semrush sends out too many warnings in a bid to keep the subscribers hooked on to their services, which sometimes does just the opposite.
Help identify Toxic Elements

Spammy backlinks can do more harm to your search engine rankings than you can ever imagine. Semrush backlink audit tool helps you identify and get rid of them and several other toxic elements.
        Too big to handle

With the many tools to help you manage your SEO and digital marketing strategies, Semrush isn’t quite easy to get your head around. If you are a complete beginner, it will take you some time to get used to the tool which is actually quite complicated to a first-timer.
One-stop Solution

Semrush is a one-stop solution for all your SEO, digital marketing, and business intelligence requirements.
        Inaccurate Ad Spend Data

Several users have complained about inaccurate data regarding the ad spend, export and other things. Again, this could be speculation or a one time glitch, and this happens with every other product
Our Verdict and Suggestion

For a website’s long-term success, it’s crucial that you get a steady stream of organic traffic.

To get organic traffic, you have to do keyword research, target the right keywords that are profitable, know what your competitors are doing and be 10 steps ahead of them.If you can afford to spend $99 a month and you are serious about growing your website’s business, I would strongly recommend you give it a try for 2-3 months. You won’t regret this decision.

Consider this. After implementing suggestions from the keyword optimization tool, I was able to increase one of my website’s revenue by 23%, this recovers the $99 monthly investment for me. Sure I am still paying for the subscription but at the same time, my revenues and sales are also increasing, which is absolutely vital for the success of my business.

However, if you are just starting out and don’t know the basics, don’t have enough content on the website and have not hustled a bit, I would suggest you stay limited to free keyword research tools. You don’t need an advanced tool yet, you can do it later. You should focus on creating good content and learn the basics of website development, monetization, promotion, SEO and so forth.

What is Semrush?

The Semrush SEO tool is a big piece of software that helps improve your website and SEO. You can use it to get different types of data about your website, or those of competitors. Using this data, you find opportunities that help you get an edge.

For example, Semrush can help you analyze:

    What people are searching online
    What topics you can create content for to get more traffic
    Which websites you can target for link-building outreach
    What technical aspects you can improve on your website

And this is just the tip of the iceberg. The Semrush tool comes with hundreds of small and large features to help improve your online presence. We will go through some of these features in this Semrush review.

Case in point: Edelweiss Bakery. When faced with a shortage of orders, it used the Semrush SEO tool to identify what to optimize in three key areas: main SEO, content marketing, and ecommerce.

And Semrush helped them improve both organic traffic and search rankings for multiple keywords. Using Semrush, the company was able to boost its mobile organic traffic by 460%.

Who is Semrush for?

Semrush has been designed with a general business audience in mind. That said, an SEO background will definitely help you get more from the software.

It’s best suited for experienced bloggers, digital marketing professionals, and agencies for whom SEO is serious business. Because that’s when they’d be willing to invest $100 or more per month on such a tool.
Semrush key features

Now that you know what Semrush is, let’s continue this Semrush review with some of the core SEO tools you get with your subscription.
Domain Analysis

A typical SEO project starts with domain analysis, in which you get an overview of the strength of your domain from an SEO perspective. Based on this data, you determine the right approach to improve your website’s SEO.

Alternatively, you can analyze a competitor’s domain and compare the results with yours. So you get an accurate sense of the time, budget, and efforts you’ll need to outrank the rival.

Domain analysis also helps you shortlist websites that you might approach to build backlinks. That’s because a backlink from a high authority domain holds more value than a low-value domain.

To conduct a domain analysis in the Semrush SEO tool, just enter the domain URL in the ‘domain overview’ section. And you’ll get a detailed report on where the domain stands.

The metric that’ll give you the quickest assessment of your website is the ‘authority score.’

There’s one thing you need to keep in mind when you review the different metrics in your report. While most of the numbers you’re seeing are based on hard data, the traffic numbers are not. They are estimates. So they may not always be 100% correct.

Also, a great feature worth mentioning here is the competitive positioning map. It’s a visual that shows you where your site stands against similar players in your niche.

Another noteworthy report is the breakdown of the search intent behind the keywords a domain ranks for. This gives you a sense of why people click on certain links when they search for a keyword. For example, do they need information on a topic, or do they want to make a purchase?

This is crucial data as search intent is one of the key SEO trends that marketers are focusing on these days. According to Gartner, over 70% of marketers will utilize third-party intent data for sales and marketing by the end of 2022.

However, one key data point we found missing in the Semrush tool is the cost estimate. For example, when you conduct domain analysis in Ahrefs, it shows you the cost of advertising for the same amount of traffic that you’re getting organically from search.

So you get to know how much money you have saved by investing in SEO as compared to advertising.

It’s not that the Semrush SEO tool doesn’t give you this data, but it’s not part of the domain overview report. To get this data in Semrush, you’ll have to navigate to a separate report, known as Organic Research.

Overall, the domain analysis feature of Semrush is solid, and it gives you a ton of valuable insights into the SEO performance of a domain.
Keyword research

The Keyword Overview tool in Semrush gives you essential data on your target keyword. This includes:

    Number of searches per month
    Difficulty score (how hard would it be to rank for the keyword)
    Websites that are ranking for the keyword
    Related keywords you can target

And you can do this analysis for a specific country.

To get even more keyword suggestions in detail, you can use the Keyword Magic tool. It gives you a more extensive list of keywords, along with the same metrics as discussed above. You can also sort or filter this data based on a specific metric.

When it comes to keyword research, one of Semrush’s unique features is the inclusion of keyword intent. It tells you whether the search intent is I, N, C, or T (informational, navigational, commercial, or transactional).

If the intent is informational, that means the user wants to find information on a specific topic. And if it’s commercial, the user is considering a product or service. Navigational intent implies that the user wants to locate a website, and a transactional intent signals the desire to complete an action.

These insights provide you with more context about the keywords than search volume alone. And they help you make better decisions.

The bottom line? Semrush’s keyword research tool is a comprehensive solution to analyze and find the right keywords for your business.
Rank tracking

Rank tracking lets you monitor the position of your website in search engine result pages for the keywords you select. To set this up in the Semrush tool, head over to the position tracker section and enter a domain name.

Next, just add the keywords for which you want to track search rankings.

That’s it. You will now get a report showing how your website is performing in the SERPs (search engine result pages), and how the ranking is changing over time.

You can also set up email notifications for important events, such as when your website hits one of the top 10 spots, or when its ranking drops for a keyword. Overall, it’s a robust feature that works well in general.
Backlink analysis

A website’s SEO performance depends heavily on the number of backlinks pointing to it from other sites. In fact, according to a study by Backlinko, the #1 result in Google has an average of 3.8x more backlinks than positions #2-#10.

So backlinks analysis is one of the most critical features of any SEO tool. And Semrush doesn’t disappoint here too. Enter a domain name it will show you a vast index of backlinks it has.

There’s plenty of valuable data here, along with trends showing when a website has gained or lost backlinks. You can also see how valuable each of the links is from an SEO perspective.
Site audit

An SEO audit analyzes your website for on-page SEO factors and lets you identify areas of improvement. According to Geoff Kennedy, Head of Marketing at Sitebulb:

    “The goal of an SEO audit is to improve a website’s presence and performance in Google and other search engines.”

That’s why another valuable feature worth mentioning in this Semrush review is the site auditing functionality.

It can help you identify issues like:

    Slow-loading pages
    Duplicate content
    SSL errors
    Crawling problems
    Google’s core web vitals (to assess website speed and stability)
    Missing headers and other metadata
    Keyword stuffing

A great addition to this feature is the ability to export tasks. For the issues you want to address, you can turn them into tasks and assign them to your team members in any of the popular project management apps.

There is direct integration with Trello. And if you use another project management tool, you can connect it with Semrush using Zapier.
Semrush pricing and value for money

Getting access to a large amount of data and competitor intelligence is expensive. For this reason, tools like Semrush don’t come for cheap. If you’re looking for more affordable SEO software, Mangools would be a better fit for you.

The Semrush SEO tool has three main pricing plans:

    Pro: $119.95 per month
    Guru: $229.95 per month
    Business: $449.95 per month

But you can get a 17% discount if you agree to pay for the whole year in advance.

The three plans differ in not just the number of reports or keywords you get to view, but also the features you get access to. With the Guru and Business plans, for example, you get access to content marketing tools not available in the Pro plan.

Also, you can try it at no cost for seven days to see if it meets your needs. But you’ll have to give your credit card details to claim the free trial.
Semrush pros and cons

Now, let’s look at the key factors we liked and didn’t like about Semrush.
Semrush pros

The Semrush tool shines bright in the following areas:

Breadth and depth of features: Semrush tries to provide as many SEO, content marketing, and social media features as possible under a single roof.

A vast and largely accurate database: The accuracy of an SEO tool’s analysis depends heavily on the quality and quantity of its link index. And Semrush fairs well in this aspect.

It boasts of 43 trillion URLs in its link database, which is comparable to competitors Moz (43 trillion), Ahrefs (29 trillion), and Majestic (10 trillion).

Generous reporting limits: As compared to similar products, the Semrush tool lets you pull a good number of reports per day.

PPC data: As seen in this Semrush review, the tool doesn’t just provide intelligence for SEO, but also lets you improve other types of campaigns, including PPC. It goes ahead of other tools by presenting you with detailed CPC competition and distribution reports, ad previews, and panning tools.
Semrush cons

Here are some of the annoying aspects of Semrush:

Pricing: The worst part of using the Semrush SEO tool is that you get only one user account with any plan. So you can’t add any team members. And adding each new user would cost you $45 to $100 extra.

Compare this with Semrush’s leading competitors, who are more generous in this area. Unlike Semrush, you get to add more users in other tools’ high-tier plans.

Another factor that makes Semrush expensive is that some features can only be accessed with an addon. And you pay $200 per month for the addon.

User interface and ease of use: The Semrush interface is similar to other leading SEO software in the market. You get lots of data packaged in the form of lists, tables, and graphs. And everything is easy to understand if you have some background in SEO.

But that doesn’t mean it can’t be simplified. Mangools, for example, has a much better UI that suits even beginners. And it doesn’t even cost as much as Semrush.
Final verdict on Semrush

To sum up this Semrush review, it is a solid SEO tool that gives an abundance of data you need for SEO success.

There are some downsides with regard to pricing and other factors we mentioned above. But overall, the Semrush SEO tool is a strong contender for marketers in highly competitive niches. Because in a competitive market, you need all the data you can get to improve your search rankings. Start your free 7-day trial.

What is Semrush?

screenshot of semrush home page

Semrush is a feature-rich suite of tools that manages all aspects of online visibility. It has all the tools needed for SEO, content marketing, competitor analysis, social media, and ads in one spot. It helps gather all necessary data to make intelligent decisions, find opportunities, set goals, and monitor progress against competitors. What makes Semrush unique?

Semrush stands out from its competitors because of its holistic approach. With all digital marketing tools in one interface, online marketing becomes more straightforward and efficient. Semrush has tools for market research, strategy, planning, content production, advertising, and measuring results. All of which work together seamlessly. Semrush User Experience

Users usually have a highly beneficial experience with Semrush. They praise its user-friendly interface, easy navigation, and abundant tools and features.

The platform’s extensive functionality enables users to manage all aspects of digital marketing from a single dashboard. Semrush’s data-driven insights empower users to make informed decisions, strategize effectively, and easily track performance. Many users like the educational resources from Semrush, too. These resources help them understand digital marketing better and use the platform more effectively.

However, beginners may need time to familiarize themselves with all the features before getting the most out of them. In the end, though, most users agree that Semrush is a solid and flexible digital marketing tool. One that improves online visibility and business results. My Experience Using Semrush as a Professional Digital Marketer

As the former editor of the Elegant Themes blog, I have personally used Semrush for years. I’ve found it to be an indispensable tool.

While the platform has expanded over the years, it began as an SEO platform. As a result, its SEO-related tools are industry-leading. It makes it easy to identify keywords and topics you want to rank for, especially in highly competitive niches like WordPress. It also makes it possible to expand into related topics successfully.

The learning curve was steep but not steeper than I expected. If you want to do something challenging and complex, you should expect your tools to be sophisticated and require training. Our team learned to use Semrush through their free resources, blog posts by others, and exploration of the tool itself. The results have been well worth it. Semrush Key Features

The Semrush platform is extensive. Providing an overview in a single post without it getting too long isn’t easy. That’s why I’ll discuss the most beneficial features instead of explaining every tool. Keyword Research

screenshot of semrush's keyword overview tool

Semrush offers a robust set of comprehensive keyword research tools and metrics to enhance your keyword strategy.

    The Keyword Overview tool (pictured above) shows a keyword’s search volume, number of results, trend data, and more.
    The Keyword Difficulty tool assesses how hard it would be to rank higher than competitors for a top keyword.
    The Keyword Gap tool allows you to compare your keywords with your competitors’. The Organic Research tool provides insights into your competitors’ organic search rankings.
    The Keyword Magic tool creates many keyword suggestions and studies their details to help improve SEO strategies.

Here, the Keyword Magic Tool analyzes the keyword “movies.” In seconds, it generated a list of millions of related keywords and variations you can sort, filter, and explore until you find the best ones for your project.

For these reasons, Semrush is one of the top keyword research tools out there. Site Audit

screenshot of semrush's site audit tool

The Site Audit feature is an incredibly powerful tool that checks your website for common SEO issues and provides instant insights into its overall health.

First, it performs an exhaustive scan of all the pages on your website. It identifies errors, warnings, and notices that could affect your site’s search engine performance. As it goes, it assigns priority to issues that need immediate attention and offers practical suggestions for improvement. Finally, it provides an overall site health score, which you can improve by addressing the issues flagged.

screenshot of semrush's site audit errors report

I especially like how the audit indicates the error, why it occurred, and how to fix it. This contextual information is extremely helpful and makes it easier to delegate specific fixes. Semrush displays a lot of useful information like this throughout all its tools.

Learn how to conduct an SEO site audit. Competitor Analysis

Semrush provides a wide array of tools that empower users to understand their competition’s strategies better. It offers insights into competitors’ keyword analytics, backlinks, ads, and more. This makes it easy to spot their strengths and weaknesses.

These tools automatically monitor changes in your competitors’ online visibility, track their website’s organic and paid search traffic, and allow you to compare multiple competitors simultaneously. By providing actionable data, you can identify growth opportunities and improve digital marketing strategies.

Semrush allows users to monitor and analyze their website’s search engine rankings for chosen keywords. The tool provides up-to-date information on the visibility of your website, the success of your SEO and PPC efforts, and how well your website is doing on search engines in different locations.

And, of course, it shows how your site ranks compared to competitors and gives suggestions for outperforming them. On-Page SEO

The On-Page SEO Checker is a comprehensive tool that provides actionable recommendations, helping users optimize individual web pages. It performs a detailed analysis of all SEO factors, including content length, keyword usage, meta tags, and internal linking.

It then generates ideas based on top competitors’ pages. This makes it easy to compare your content with the best in the industry. Content Marketing and AI Tools

screenshot of semrush's topic research feature

Semrush’s Content Marketing Toolkit is a suite of tools designed to streamline every aspect of a content marketing campaign. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help you create SEO content much faster, making it one of the best AI SEO tools for website owners.

    The Topic Research tool generates ideas for fresh, engaging content based on trending topics, questions, and related searches.
    The Post Tracking tool monitors your content’s performance across various metrics.

In the screenshot above, I’ve used the “import text from URL” feature of the SEO Writing Assistant. It’s populated the content area with a published post from my blog. It has given me a wide range of suggested improvements that I can use to update that post for better performance. Reporting and Analytics

Aside from the key features that draw the most attention from prospective users, Semrush has many other tools and features worth mentioning. Depending on the plan you choose when signing up, some of these tools will either require an upgrade or a paid add-on to use. Local SEO Tools

These tools include Listing Management, which synchronizes and manages your business’s online presence across top local directories, ensuring consistent and accurate data. Additionally, the Local Rank Tracker monitors your website’s local search performance.

These platforms include Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Google My Business. Semrush also analyzes competitors’ social audiences, activity, and engagement on those platforms. Because it shares features similar to the best social media tools, you can save money with this built into the platform.

The Social Inbox, a new feature currently in beta, is worth highlighting here. It monitors incoming messages across all supported platforms, providing quick response capabilities and a centralized view of comments and direct messages. This is a real “force multiplier” for small teams. .Trends

screenshot of semrush's market research tool

The .Trends feature is a powerful tool for comprehensive competitive intelligence. It provides valuable insights into competitors’ website traffic, user behavior, market share, content, and ad strategies. It then provides actionable insights to improve your own business. Marketing Agency Solutions

Semrush’s Agency Solutions are purpose-built tools and features to support digital agencies managing multiple clients. The suite includes the Client Manager, a centralized dashboard to manage all client projects and deliverables.

Educational Resources

Their Academy provides free online digital marketing courses with certification options. The Semrush blog features insightful articles on various digital marketing strategies. The Knowledge Base (Help Center) is a resource for users to learn about different aspects of digital marketing.

Semrush’s SplitSignal tool is an A/B testing instrument for SEO professionals and website owners. It empowers them to conduct SEO experiments, analyze performance changes, and make data-driven decisions to improve organic traffic. Semrush Pricing

Semrush’s pricing is geared towards businesses who use their platform as an essential part of their operations. The pricing tiers begin at a rate for freelancers and startups and then progress to custom enterprise options.

Pro plan: At $99.95 per month, this is the most affordable plan, ideal for freelancers, startups, and in-house marketers on a tighter budget. It includes basic features such as keyword and competitor analysis, site audit, on-page SEO checker, position tracking of 500 keywords, and 3 projects.

Among the bottom three tiers of pricing, considerations such as the number of projects, number of keywords, and API access will dictate which plan most folks end up going with. Semrush Pros and Cons

In this article, we’ve discussed many details, even though we’ve summarized a lot. To further simplify things, I’ve compiled a list of pros and cons below. Pros

    Robust SEO Capabilities: Semrush has created industry-leading SEO tools for every essential task. Tools for keyword research, backlink analysis, site auditing, position tracking, on-page SEO, and more.
    Effective Advertising Tools: Semrush helps users improve online ad campaigns, analyze competition, and research keywords across various platforms.
    Powerful Social Media Toolkit: Semrush facilitates social media management by offering features for content creation, sharing, scheduling, tracking, and analysis across multiple social platforms.
    Comprehensive Competitive Intelligence: The .Trends feature provides valuable insights into user and competitor website traffic, user behavior, market share, content, and ad strategies.
    Agency Solutions: Semrush’s tools aid digital agencies in managing multiple client portfolios with ease while demonstrating their value.
    Educational Resources: Semrush helps users improve their digital marketing skills by providing a wealth of free educational resources.
    Extra Tools: Semrush offers additional SaaS solutions that complement its core product—tools like Content Marketplace, E-commerce Booster, Prowly, Kompyte, and SplitSignal.

Cons

    Limited Number of Projects: With basic plans, the number of projects you can manage simultaneously is limited. This may restrict users from managing multiple websites or client portfolios.
    Complex User Interface: The vast array of tools and features can make the user interface feel overwhelming. This is particularly true for beginners who are new to digital marketing.
    Learning Curve: Understanding and using all the platform’s features takes time and effort because it is comprehensive.
    Expensive Pricing Plans: Semrush’s most advanced features are only available in the higher-priced plans.
    Slow Report Generation: Users have reported slow report generation times during peak usage hours, which can impact productivity.
    Limited Social Media Platforms: The social media toolkit currently supports Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Google My Business. The absence of others like Snapchat and TikTok might be a drawback for some users.
    Restricted API Access: Semrush restricts API access to its higher-tier plans. This limits the ability of lower-tier users to integrate Semrush with other tools and systems their business uses.

Semrush Alternatives

While it’s true that Semrush is a best-in-class tool, the alternatives below are also highly recommended. Some folks may find that their needs are more limited than the number of tools they’d be paying for with Semrush. Or, they may want a tool that focuses only on a specific aspect of digital marketing. In any event, these are some Semrush alternatives worth considering. SE Ranking

screenshot of se rankings website

SE Ranking shines in terms of affordability and simplicity—an ideal choice for small businesses or those new to SEO. However, while its feature set is broad, it does not offer the same depth of functionality found in Semrush. BrightLocal

screenshot of BrightLocal website

BrightLocal and Semrush are powerful SEO tools that serve slightly different needs. Specializing in local SEO, BrightLocal is an ideal choice for businesses wanting to enhance their local online visibility. Features like its local search audit, citation builder, local search grid, and reputation manager help companies bring a laser focus to establishing their local presence. On the other hand, Semrush offers a broader range of SEO tools, including keyword research, site audits, and competitor analysis, making it ideal for comprehensive digital marketing campaigns. SEObility

screenshot of SEObility website

SEObility and Semrush are comprehensive SEO tools with their own strengths. Praised for its website optimization features, SEObility primarily intends to check your site thoroughly for improvement opportunities. It also has a slightly higher rating on the popular software review and comparison site G2, with 4.6/5 stars from 233 reviews. On the other hand, Semrush is highly rated for its broad range of features, like keyword research and competitor analysis. It has a rating of 4.5/5 stars from 1,876 reviews on G2. The choice between the two often depends on specific user needs and preferences–including, perhaps especially, price point. Ahrefs

screenshot of ahrefs website

One of the primary alternatives to Semrush is Ahrefs, which is renowned for its backlink analysis capabilities. Users might choose Ahrefs over Semrush if they prioritize link building and require extensive backlink data. Ahrefs also has a more straightforward interface that is often easier for beginners to navigate. Moz Pro

screenshot of moz pro website

Semrush and Moz Pro provide various digital marketing tools to boost online visibility. People know Semrush for its all-inclusive features, while Moz Pro excels in local SEO. This makes Moz Pro a solid choice for businesses focusing on improving local market presence. SpyFu

screenshot of spyfu website

In the world of SEO tools, Spyfu is a formidable contender. While Semrush is more comprehensive, SpyFu focuses on competition spying and keyword insights. For marketers with a narrower focus, it may be the better tool. Serpstat

screenshot of serpstat website

Serpstat is great at keyword research and SEO analysis. However, when comparing the user interface, educational resources, and overall suite of tools and features, Semrush often comes out on top. While both platforms have robust SERP features, choosing between Semrush and Serpstat typically comes to budget. SEO Powersuite

screenshot of so powersuite website

SEO PowerSuite is a desktop application offering an all-in-one SEO toolkit. It includes keyword research, backlink analysis, rank tracking, and on-page SEO auditing capabilities. The choice between Semrush and SEO PowerSuite often comes down to the specific needs and preferences of the user, such as the preference for a web vs desktop tool, the need for ongoing learning resources, or budget constraints. Semrush Review: The Verdict

Semrush stands out as an incredibly comprehensive and versatile digital marketing platform. It excels because of its extensive range of tools, user-friendly interface, and robust educational resources. It’s an excellent fit for anyone doing a wide variety of marketing tasks–especially teams.

The most commonly cited critique of Semrush is its complexity and steep learning curve. However, given the complex nature of the work itself and the high-quality educational materials provided, that may be a moot point to serious marketing professionals.

Another common critique (or at least downside) often associated with Semrush is its price point. Again, anyone taking full advantage of this platform to service multiple clients should have no problem affording it. On the other hand, website owners who may be just as serious but have less marketing experience may want to be more careful, ensuring that the value they’re getting is worth the price.

Ultimately, those who need and can afford it would be hard-pressed to find a better digital marketing solution than Semrush.

    Spy on your competitors (ethically, of course!): SEMrush lets you analyze what your competitors are doing online, so you can learn from their successes and avoid their mistakes.

    Fine-tune your website: Think of SEMrush as a website doctor. It identifies areas for improvement to ensure your website is running smoothly and attracting visitors.

Now that you have a general idea of what SEMrush can do, let’s delve deeper into some of its key advantages:
Comprehensive Keyword Research

Finding the right keywords is like having a treasure map for your online marketing journey. SEMrush offers a powerful keyword research tool that helps you discover:

    Search Volume: This tells you how many people are searching for a particular keyword each month. The higher the search volume, the more potential customers you can reach.
    Competition Level: This indicates how difficult it is to rank for a specific keyword. Lower competition is ideal, as it means you have a better chance of appearing at the top of search results.
    Related Keywords: SEMrush suggests additional keywords related to your main topic, helping you expand your reach and attract a wider audience.

    Imagine you run a bakery. Using SEMrush’s keyword research tool, you might discover that “best cupcakes near me” has a high search volume but also high competition. However, you might find “easy chocolate chip cookie recipe” has a good search volume with lower competition. This allows you to target both high-intent searchers looking for a bakery and potential customers searching for baking recipes, potentially leading them to discover your bakery and try your delicious treats!

Competitor Analysis

Knowledge is power, and when it comes to online marketing, knowing what your competitors are doing can give you a significant edge. SEMrush’s competitor analysis tools allow you to:

    See their top keywords: Uncover the keywords your competitors are ranking for and identify potential gaps in your own keyword strategy.
    Analyze their website traffic: Gain insights into how much traffic your competitors are attracting and where it’s coming from.
    Compare your advertising strategies: See what kind of ads your competitors are running and identify opportunities to create more effective campaigns for your own business.

What You Can Learn


Example

Top Keywords


Identify keywords your competitor ranks for but you don’t.


You discover a local bakery competitor ranks highly for “gluten-free cake pops.”

Website Traffic


See where your competitor’s website traffic comes from (organic search, social media, etc.).


You learn your competitor receives a lot of traffic from recipe blogs featuring their desserts.

Advertising Strategies


Analyze the type of ads your competitor runs (search ads, social media ads).


You see your competitor runs targeted ads on Facebook featuring their new line of seasonal cupcakes.
On-Page SEO Optimization

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is all about making your website search engine friendly, so it appears higher in search results when people search for keywords related to your business. SEMrush equips you with tools to:

    Identify technical SEO issues: Think of these as roadblocks on your website that might prevent search engines from finding and indexing your content. SEMrush helps you identify and fix these issues to ensure your website is running smoothly.
    Optimize your website content: SEMrush analyzes your website content and suggests improvements to target relevant keywords and make it more appealing to search engines.
    Track your SEO progress: Monitor your website’s ranking for important keywords over time and see how your SEO efforts are paying off.

    Imagine you have a blog post on your bakery website about the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe. SEMrush might suggest optimizing the title to include relevant keywords like “easy chocolate chip cookie recipe” and adding internal links to other baking recipe blog posts on your website. This improves the overall SEO health of your website and increases the chances of your recipe appearing higher in search results when people search for cookie recipes.

Backlink Analysis

Backlinks are like votes of confidence for your website in the online world. When other websites link to your content, it tells search engines that your website is valuable and trustworthy. SEMrush helps you:

    Identify your backlinks: See where your backlinks are coming from and understand the quality of these links. High-quality backlinks from reputable websites can significantly boost your SEO ranking.
    Find backlink opportunities: Discover potential websites where you can earn valuable backlinks and expand your online reach.

    Let’s say your bakery partners with a local food blogger who features your delicious cupcakes on their website with a link back to your bakery website. SEMrush would identify this as a valuable backlink, helping to improve your website’s authority and search engine ranking.

Content Marketing

Creating high-quality content is essential for attracting and engaging your audience. SEMrush offers features to:

    Discover trending topics: See what kind of content is currently popular and relevant to your audience.
    Analyze your content performance: Track how well your existing content is performing and identify areas for improvement.
    Create content calendars: Organize your content creation process and ensure you’re consistently publishing fresh and engaging content.

    Using SEMrush’s content marketing tools, you discover that blog posts featuring “vegan baking tips” are trending. This might inspire you to create a blog post on your bakery website showcasing delicious vegan cookie recipe options, attracting a new audience segment interested in vegan treats.

Paid Advertising (PPC)

Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising allows you to display targeted ads to potential customers searching for keywords related to your business. SEMrush helps you:

    Manage your PPC campaigns: Create, monitor, and optimize your PPC campaigns to ensure you’re getting the most out of your advertising budget.
    Target the right audience: Reach potential customers who are most likely to be interested in your products or services.
    Track your PPC performance: See how your PPC campaigns are performing and adjust your strategy for better results.

    Imagine you’re launching a new line of seasonal pumpkin spice cookies at your bakery. SEMrush can help you create targeted PPC ads displayed when people search for “pumpkin spice cookies near me,” driving them to your website and potentially increasing sales of your new seasonal treat.

User-Friendly Interface

Even the most powerful tools can be useless if they’re too complex to use. Thankfully, SEMrush boasts a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate, even for beginners. With clear menus, helpful tutorials, and visual reports, you can quickly grasp the information you need to make informed decisions about your online marketing strategy.

Cons of SEMrush

While SEMrush offers a treasure trove of benefits, it’s important to consider some potential drawbacks before diving in:

    Pricing and Plans: SEMrush offers various subscription plans, but they can be expensive for small businesses or startups on a tight budget. The most basic plan offers limited features, and higher tiers with more functionality come at a steeper price.
    Learning Curve: While the interface is user-friendly, SEMrush has a vast array of features. It might take some time to learn the ropes and discover the full potential of the platform, especially for complete beginners in the world of SEO and digital marketing.
    Data Overload: SEMrush provides a wealth of data and reports. This can be overwhelming at times, especially for those new to the platform. It’s important to identify the most relevant data and focus on the metrics that matter most to your specific marketing goals.
    Limited Backlink Control: While SEMrush helps you identify backlinks and potential backlink opportunities, you can’t directly control which websites link to yours. Earning high-quality backlinks takes time and effort, and building relationships with other websites is crucial.
    Focus on Paid Features: Some of the most advanced features within SEMrush are only available in higher-tier, more expensive plans. This can be limiting for businesses on a tight budget who might not need all the bells and whistles.

How does SEMrush pull data?

When you use SEMrush software, you will see that it pulls data to help you understand how you and your competitors’ sites are performing. There are two main ways that SEMrush pulls data.

The first way is through their search bar. If you type in a website’s URL into the search bar, you will pull reports on that domain and see keyword selections. This helps you research your competitors and find valuable ways to compete with them.

The second way is through creating a project. SEMrush projects gather data from outside their database. They analyze your website’s visibility and help you see how you compete with your competition.
What are SEMrush toolkits?

SEMrush toolkits are a combination of different reports and tools that you can customize to help you understand your campaign better. When you use a toolkit, you have access to a variety of reports and tools. While you may not need every single one offered, you have the option to customize your toolkit to fit your business.

When you first start using SEMrush, you may not know which tools you need. To figure out the right tools, think about your plan and your goals. What are you trying to achieve with your SEO campaign, and what tools would help you best achieve that goal?

There are toolkits for all methods that SEMrush offers, so you’ll need to choose the tools that are best for your campaign. Also, don’t feel obligated to use a certain number of tools. The most important part is that you select tools that will help you monitor your campaign’s success.
How much does SEMrush cost?

SEMrush offers several different plans. The cost is dependent upon the plan you choose and whether you want to use a monthly or yearly plan.

You can start with a 14-day free trial to get a feel for SEMrush and then move on to a paid membership. Monthly memberships start from $99.95, while annual memberships start from $999.40.

Each package offers a technical SEO audit and semantic core collection. You’ll get access to position tracking features and analysis of backlinks. In addition, SEMrush will provide you with ideas to help you earn more traffic to your site.
Why use SEMrush?

If you’re looking to run your SEO campaign on your own, SEMrush is a great software to use. There are numerous benefits to using SEMrush.
1. You’ll understand your site’s performance

When you’re running an SEO campaign, it takes time to show results. You’re left wondering whether your optimizations are working. With SEMrush, you’ll get insight into your campaign’s performance.

SEMrush tells you how your site is performing. You’ll see how much traffic you obtain through organic means (as well as paid traffic). It’ll show you if you’re seeing an increase or decrease in your website traffic.

You will also see how you rank for keywords. SEMrush will let you know if you’re ranking better or worse for keywords. This allows you to optimize your campaign to keep ranking for your keywords or improve your campaign to rank better for them.
2. You’ll find valuable keywords

Keywords selection is an integral part of SEO. When your audience conducts a search, they use keywords to find relevant search results. You will be able to find valuable keywords for your campaign with SEMrush.

To find the right keywords for your campaign, you’ll conduct keyword research. This helps you generate a list of valuable keywords that your business can use.

Generally, you’ll want to focus on long-tail keywords. These are keywords that contain three or more words. Long-tail keywords are better for your SEO campaign because they drive in more relevant leads to your business.

With SEMrush, you’ll also be able to identify the keywords your competitors are using. This gives insight into keywords your business may be missing so that you can reach valuable leads.
3. You’ll understand your competition

As you run an SEO campaign, a huge part of your strategy revolves around monitoring your competition. For example, there are dozens of businesses that will compete for the same keywords, so it’s helpful to know which keywords they want.

Using SEMrush, you can learn what your competitors are doing with their SEO campaign. This will help you improve your SEO campaign, so you can outperform them.

It’s also valuable to learn from your competition. They may have keywords that are successfully driving in traffic. If you know what they are, you can take advantage of this knowledge and implement those keywords into your own plan.

SEMrush is a valuable tool to help you understand your competition and compete with them. When you know your competitors better, you will create more impactful strategies.
4. You’ll keep existing traffic

When you obtain valuable traffic, your next goal should be to keep that traffic. You don’t want to go through all the effort to obtain the traffic only to push them away. It’s critical that you put effort into keeping your leads engaged and interested in your page.

With SEMrush, you can choose to track certain locations, monitor keyword positions, connect to Google analytics, and more to keep your existing traffic happy. SEMrush offers all the tools you need to keep your existing traffic satisfied while you attract new traffic to your page.
5. You’ll earn valuable backlinks

Backlinks are a crucial part of your online presence. These are links that you obtain from authority sites. They help improve the authority and trust of your site.

When you obtain backlinks, you should earn them from credible, authoritative sites. Google trusts your site more when you earn backlinks from established sites that are trusted by audiences.

You will earn more valuable backlinks with SEMrush. This tool allows you to see where you can earn backlinks if you aren’t already earning them from a particular authority site.

It’s also a great way to see what backlinks your competitors earn. You’ll know how many backlinks they have and can use that information to create a better strategy for your business.
SEMrush vs. an SEO company: Which is better?

SEMrush has numerous great features to offer your business. You may start wondering if it’s better to use software like SEMrush or if you should hire an SEO company. So, which is better for your business?

If you have the time and patience to learn about SEO, SEMrush is a great option. It gives you the ability to be in control of your SEO campaign and makes it easy to understand how to run one. The drawback is that you’ll need to rely on your team to implement your strategy, which means more time spent on your SEO campaign than other projects.

For businesses that don’t have the time to run an SEO campaign, an SEO company is a great choice. You can worry about your business while your SEO company runs your campaign. An SEO company will have the knowledge and experience to run a successful campaign for your business.

How to Use SEMrush

As we mentioned, SEMrush can help you find the keywords you need to create useful and engaging content that your audience is interested in.
However, there are five main ways that it can be used to significantly enhance your digital marketing strategy. These include toolkits for the following:

    SEO
    Market Research
    PR and Content
    Social Media
    Paid Traffic

SEO
SEMrush SEO toolskit snapshot of dashboard

SEMrush’s SEO Toolkit is a thorough data analytics tool that can audit your website and webpages for trouble spots, and even analyze backlinks. With a simple, user-friendly dashboard, you’re able to see data for your top keywords, view your site performance, and discover what errors and warnings are holding your website back from its full potential.
Market Research
competitor research toolkit snapshot from SEMrush dashboard

The digital marketplace is extremely competitive, and you need to have plans in place to outdo your competition on the Internet. The Competitive Research Toolkit from SEMrush can show you the number of visits and visitor engagement that you’ve received on your website across multiple devices. It also displays the average length of time spent on each page and its bounce rate percentage. This is very useful for identifying trends and modifying content to improve your website traffic and, ultimately, sell more products and services than your competitors.
PR and Content

What’s interesting about SEMrush is that it includes a Content Marketing Toolkit that can present the performance of your overall content. For example, suppose you wrote a blog article for one of your products. The Content Marketing Toolkit will tell you exactly how well that blog is performing on search engines and suggest changes you can make so that it performs even better. This unique toolkit even comes with an editorial calendar for your content team to organize and strategize your content.
Social Media

SEMrush also serves as a powerful extension to social media performance. Its Social Media Toolkit can look at the performance of each of your posts, schedule posts in advance, and even boost your Facebook posts. SEMrush makes it easier than ever to get a glimpse of your competitors’ social strategies and build a more effective social media presence.
Paid Traffic

Lastly, SEMrush’s Advertising Toolkit can help identify paid search trends and display the lowest and highest average cost-per-click (CPC) for your campaign. It can even breakdown the pay-per-click (PPC) cost in your area.
How Much is SEMrush?

Since there are a variety of SEO and keyword research tools available, it may seem challenging to decide which solution is best for your business, especially if you’re new to SEO. However, while it may share similarities with other tools such as Ahrefs, Moz, and Spyfu, SEMrush’s overall user experience is so detailed that any e-commerce business can reap the benefits of its services.

There are multiple SEMrush pricing models available, depending on what type of business your company represents:

    Pro ($99.95/month, for freelancers)
    Guru ($199.95/month, for small businesses and start-up marketing agencies)
    Business ($399.95/month, for larger e-commerce businesses or agencies)
    Enterprise (custom priced to meet your custom needs)

If you’d like to try it out before committing to a monthly or yearly subscription, SEMrush free trial options are offered for both the “Pro” and “Guru” models.",https://www.outerboxdesign.com/search-marketing/seo-tips/what-is-semrush,SemRush

While SEO can be complicated and difficult to understand, this is still one of the best ways to draw traffic and improve your website’s search ranking.

However, going through the different research and analysis processes can become even harder if you don’t have the right digital marketing tools at your disposal.

This is where Semrush steps in.

Over the last few years, Semrush has become one of the most popular SEO tools for companies that need help optimizing their website for search engines and running digital marketing campaigns.

Do the advanced features and metrics in the software seem a bit too complicated to understand? Don’t worry, we will explain everything you need to know about Semrush and how you can use it to take your SEO strategy to the next level.

What Is Semrush and How Does It Work?

Semrush is a popular SEO tool for conducting keyword research, competitor analysis, and Google Ad optimization.

It is an all-in-one marketing reporting software designed to help digital marketers optimize their websites for better organic search traffic. You can also see how you stack up against your competitors and make better data-driven decisions around what keywords to target for both organic search efforts and Google ad campaigns.

Many of the leading brands use Semrush, including Booking.com, Quora, HP, and eBay.

By using this advanced SEO tool, you can quickly recognize patterns and trends in your specific niche. This will allow you to review your on-page SEO and identify which areas need to be optimized for more efficient lead generation.

Additionally, Semrush is one of the best tools for keyword research. You will gain an insight into which keywords your competitors are applying and see how they are ranked. With the wealthy amount of data you receive, it will be much easier to stay on top of your competition and follow the latest trends.

Although Semrush is used by some of the biggest internet marketers in the world due to its variety of advanced features, it is also very suitable for beginners. You can easily navigate through the platform and even with limited experience, Semrush makes understanding SEO much easier.

To summarize, Semrush works by providing users with an abundance of information that can be used for:

    Improving the overall performance of your website
    Tracking the most popular keywords on Google
    Creating content that has a high chance of drawing visitors
    Finding new opportunities for link-building
    Adjusting the technical elements on your website that will result in better search engine positioning

Is Semrush a Free Tool?

Semrush does have a free version, but it comes with limited services and functionality. Some of the things you can do with a free account are:

    Create and operate one Semrush project
    10 daily inquiries regarding keyword/competitor research
    Keyword tracking (limited to 10 keywords)
    Examine 100 pages of your website

While these features can be useful for beginners in digital marketing, the free version doesn’t offer nearly as much versatility and benefits as the paid version.

If you aren’t sure whether you should subscribe to Semrush, there is a 14-day free trial to test out their software. Paid plans range from $119.95 to $449.95 per month or $99.95 to $374.95 per month if you pay for an annual subscription.

They also offer an enterprise plan for big brands that require additional flexibility and customization.
What Is the Difference Between Semrush and Google Analytics?

Semrush and Google Analytics are currently the two most popular analytic tools among internet marketers. While they have some similar features, these two offer two completely different types of services.

The main difference between them is that Google Analytics is used by marketers to analyze the internal data on their website, while Semrush shifts the focus to external data and analyzes your competitor’s website.

Acquiring the internal data of your competitor’s website is not possible, so the information you get from Semrush is practically the next best thing.
PRO TIP: How to Monitor and Evaluate Your SEO Performance

If you want to understand how your visitors are behaving on your landing pages, there are several on-page events and metrics you can track from Google Analytics 4 and Google Search Console that will help:

    Organic clicks by queries. Which search queries generate the most clicks to your website?
    Organic clicks by page. Which pages receive the most clicks from search results pages?
    Organic sessions. How many organic search sessions does your website receive?
    Organic engaged sessions. How many website visitors were engaged with your content? An engaged session lasts longer than 10 seconds, has a conversion event, or has at least 2 pageviews or screenviews.
    Views per channel. Which channels generate the most views to your website?

And more…

Now you can benefit from the experience of our SEO and website conversion experts, who have put together a plug-and-play Databox template showing the most important metrics for monitoring your landing page performance. It’s simple to implement and start using as a standalone dashboard or in marketing reports, and best of all, it’s free!
GA4 SEO dashboard template

You can easily set it up in just a few clicks – no coding required.

To set up the dashboard, follow these 3 simple steps:

Step 1: Get the template

Step 2: Connect your Google Analytics 4 and Google Search Console accounts with Databox.

Step 3: Watch your dashboard populate in seconds.
What Is the Difference Between Semrush and Ahrefs?

Contrary to Google Analytics, Ahrefs is much more similar to Semrush since it is also an SEO research tool that focuses on external elements of competitors’ websites.

Nowadays, both of these tools offer pretty much the same variety of features and services, but this hasn’t always been the case. Only a few years ago, Ahrefs was known strictly as a backlink analysis tool. However, the company decided to add an abundance of new features in the meantime, making Ahrefs a worthy competitor in the SEO research industry.

The main difference between Semrush and Ahrefs is the metrics they focus on. For example, if your primary focus will be analyzing the technical side of SEO (website health e.g.) and doing keyword research, then Semrush is your ideal option.

On the other hand, Ahrefs is more suitable for digital marketers that spend more time on link building and searching for backlink opportunities.

Most Powerful Semrush Features for Improving Your Search Rankings

Now that you know what exactly Semrush is and how it works, we can move on to the specific features that you can use to improve your overall search rankings.

Semrush provides users with dozens of features, but picking out the best ones might be a bit complicated if you are new to the software.

After talking to some of the leading digital marketers in the industry and conducting our original research, we came up with a list of those that stand out as the most useful for search ranking improvement.

    Position Tracking
    On-Page SEO Checker
    SEO Content Template
    Organic Traffic Insights
    Site Audit
    Keyword Magic Tool
    Keyword Gap Analysis
    Keyword Overview
    Keyword Alert
    Keyword Tagging
    Domain Overview
    Traffic Analytics
    Link Building
    Project Dashboard

Position Tracking

Position tracking is widely known as Semrush’s most powerful feature. You can use it to check out the daily rankings of a website based on a custom group of target keywords. With all the different reports (tagging, sorting, filtering, exporting, etc.), you will acquire the data needed to analyze SEO and PPC performances.

Some of the key things that position tracking provides are:

    Keyword and domain tracking
    Geographic location comparisons
    Project device types
    Discovery of local competitors and their SEO tracking
    Featured Snippet reports (great for finding featured snippet opportunities)

“One of the most powerful Semrush features to improve your search rankings is Position Tracking,” says Sophie Burke of Bead the Change. “This will help you: track your positions for any keyword, discover local competitors, and group your keywords with tags.”

On-Page SEO Checker

The On-Page SEO Checker feature provides users with a list of things they can do to enhance their website’s pages search rankings. This list includes keyword recommendations, ideas for optimizing on-page SEO, backlink probability, target content length, and much more.

All of these recommendations are based on the target keyword analysis of the biggest real-time competitors in your specific niche.

Jakub Rudnik of Shortlister said, “For improving rankings, no tool is more important than the On-Page SEO Checker tool. Creating the best content and the best-optimized content is the most effective way to improve rankings. Getting an analysis of your pages versus their competitors with actionable steps to improve your content is crucial.”

SEO Content Template

This feature is great for content writers who need a little help creating SEO content. It generates a template with suggestions on what to include, based on target keyword analysis.

Once you enter a specific keyword, Semrush will automatically generate a template for creating SEO-friendly content.

Some of the things included in the template are:

    Text length suggestions
    Readability overview
    Supporting keyword suggestions
    Potential backlink opportunities
    Insight into how and where your competitors are using the target keywords

Eric Hoppe of Crowd Content adds, “I find their Semrush’s SEO Content Template to be a really helpful tool for evaluating how competitive a topic is, finding good subtopics and semantic keywords to cover, and finding the average word counts of the current top 10 ranked sites. If you can use this information when creating your content it goes a long way towards crafting content that will rank well.”

Organic Traffic Insights

“The Organic Traffic Insights tool is fantastic for finding quick-win opportunities,” says Sam Thomas of Embryo Digital. “Outside of your core keyword focus areas, you can find low-hanging fruit which is already driving small amounts of traffic, but with a little focus, could drastically increase the overall search rankings of a website with less resource than the typical high competition keywords. Both are important, but it’s a nice win for the client.”

The Organic Traffic Insights feature provides users with a comprehensive dashboard that includes data from your Google Search Console, Google Analytics, and Semrush account.

This dashboard includes a handful of important information such as sessions, click-through rate, organic keyword volume, rankings from Semrush, rankings from Google Search Console, and much more.

You can use this information to figure out which keywords GA didn’t provide and cross-reference the different data sources. Once you are finished, you will see the big picture behind the organic search performance of your website.
Site Audit

One of the best ways to get an estimate of your website’s health is by using Semrush’s Site Audit feature.

This feature provides you with a categorized list of problems that explains in which areas your website is underperforming. Once you fix the issues in the list, you will enhance your website’s SEO efficiency.

The technical analysis covers everything from duplicate content and broken links to crawlability and HTTPS implementation.

To explain the importance of the Site Audit feature, here is one of the quotes we acquired when talking to the leading digital marketers.

Will C of ProLightingRental – Event Light Rental eCommerce Store said, “One of the most important features that my team relies on at ProLightingRental.com is the site auditing tool. This tool is fantastic for websites with a ton of custom coding and bespoke infrastructure. As a codebase becomes more complex, there can be a host of issues that can arise when you apply a new feature or even patch an existing bug.

Many of these issues can be to the detriment of the SEO of your site. Therefore, after every deployment – I run the site auditing functionality feature to ensure there is no damage to any SEO-related infrastructure like (but not limited to) content, layout, canonicals, metadata. On more than one occasion, I have been able to catch issues and therefore minimize any SEO ramifications due to deployments that were not QA’ed efficiently enough.”

Keyword Magic Tool

The Keyword Magic Tool is probably the most popular tool on Semrush for conducting keyword research. You can use it to analyze specific niche topics, track semantically related keywords, and find which keywords could improve your website’s overall SEO.

With more than 20 billion keywords in Semrush’s database, this feature provides you with a comprehensive table that includes specific subgroups categorized by similar search terms.

“I am a huge fan of Semrush’s Keyword Magic tool,” says Blake Taylor of Synergy Business Brokers. “This tool is one of the most comprehensive keyword research tools on the market and makes identifying keyword opportunities easy. They also include a competition score, so you can get a good sense of what keyword opportunities to pursue that don’t have a ton of competition.”
Keyword Gap Analysis

You can use Keyword Gap Analysis to acquire a detailed comparison of keyword profiles of your top five competitors. By entering the domain and keyword ranking type, you will see the best opportunities for each individual website, how many keywords overlap, which keywords can be found on all of the five websites, and more.

This type of data can be helpful when making SEO strategies and campaigns since you will have an insight into which niche keywords are trending in real-time. Once you know what your competitors are doing, you will know which SEO efforts to prioritize.

Also, this analysis will provide you with keywords that are unique for your specific domain, thereby uncovering keyword gaps in your competitor’s campaigns.

“Semrush’s Keyword Gap feature is incredibly useful for identifying keywords that websites similar to yours rank for – especially because you can filter it to only keywords containing a certain phrase, or only those above a certain search volume,” says Dan Rawley of Twinkl Educational Publishing. “This allows you to easily build a list of the most valuable terms to target.”
Keyword Overview

Keyword Overview feature is used for acquiring information regarding the search volume of a specific keyword, result number, intent, CPC, level of competition, estimated value, and more.

This tool is especially helpful for beginner digital marketers that want to start their keyword research journey and find which terms they should target to attract more traffic.

Jonathan Aufray of Growth Hackers Agency said, “The most powerful Semrush feature to track and improve your search rankings is finding keywords where your website ranks on the 2nd page of Google. Once you find these pages and keywords, go to your page, add the keywords in H2, H3 tags as well as in the copy of your post. You can also link to that page from other pages of your website through internal linking with the right anchor text. Your pages will move up to the 1st page of Google searches shortly.

Don’t forget to always write for readers and for your audience, not for search engines. Therefore, when you add keywords to your content, make sure it’s relevant and makes sense. You don’t want to do keyword stuffing because this will hurt your user experience and readability of your posts.”
Keyword Alert

For the longest time, digital marketers had to manually check which keywords had gone up or down in rankings in the past few weeks, which is extremely time-consuming.

The Keyword Alert tool solved this issue by providing users with an advanced alert system that informs them on all the latest changes regarding their rankings. Whenever there is a change in a keyword ranking in your report, Semrush alerts you via email.

“The Alerts feature is helpful for quickly spotting when keywords drop a certain number of positions or fall outside the top 10,” says Robbie Richards. “With this insight, you can quickly identify the cause, and get to work recovering the rankings you worked so hard to achieve.”
Keyword Tagging

The Keyword Tagging tool is used for tracking the growth metrics of your specific tag groups. This includes visibility percentage, traffic estimates, average position, and share of voice. This feature is great for analyzing how well your tagged keywords are doing in terms of visibility.

Side note: you can only use this feature if you apply for the Guru or Business Semrush subscription.

“The ability to tag keywords is a powerful feature that allows us to quickly see performance changes for groups of keywords,” says Bruce Hogan of SoftwarePundit. “We add multiple tags for all our keywords when they are uploaded. Then, each team member enters their tags into Semrush to get a view of recent search performance.”
Domain Overview

This feature allows you to quickly acquire information about your website’s online presence through a wide range of overview metrics.

Some of the things you will see include paid search traffic, organic search traffic, backlinks, and more. After receiving the overview, you can further analyze the data by opening up the module-specific reports.

The Domain Overview tool is great for figuring out the strengths and weaknesses of your top competitors and quickly assessing which areas you should optimize on your website.

Here is a quote from one of the digital marketers that we talked to that explains just how important the Domain Overview feature is.

“Domain Overview,” says Seb Atkinson of Know Your Money. “This tool is a great way to keep tabs on competitor activity, uncovering their top pages and top organic keywords.

Domain Overview is a perfect starting point for competitor analysis. Starting with keyword ranking data, the tool also brings in link data to identify how various pieces of content are being promoted.

Furthermore, data can be exported and used alongside other Semrush modules such as Site Audit, to reverse-engineer a competitor’s strategy and learn how their technical set-up, content, and promotional activity combine to produce their search visibility.

By monitoring a range of competitors, you can get a feel for the top trends in your industry, helping to ensure your brand also has a presence for topics that rivals are being found for online. On the flip side, you can keep tabs on any competitor initiatives that may not be yielding the best results, helping you to learn from others’ mistakes and improve the chances of succeeding where others have failed.”
Traffic Analytics

Traffic Analytics feature is essentially an advanced market research tool that estimates the desktop and mobile traffic of your website. You can use this tool to analyze the potential of a new market and create an efficient media buying plan.

The main benefit of this feature is that you will see where exactly your traffic is coming from, how your visitors engage with the website, and which devices they most commonly use.

Traffic Analytics is extremely helpful for professional marketing managers, researchers, and sales teams.

One of the most popular metrics in this feature is the traffic percentage metric and here is what one of the marketers had to say about it.

“For us, traffic % is a metric we use daily,” says Julien Raby of Thermo Gears. “It basically computes the estimated volume for a keyword and our current ranking to give us an estimated traffic volume for each keyword. While the exact numbers are usually off, we like to look at trends to see if we’re gaining volume or not in certain keywords categories.”
Link Building

The Link Building feature is great for users who are searching for new link-building opportunities within their niche. Also, you will acquire an advanced interface that you can use to create an outreach campaign to attract backlinks.

There are four different tools within the feature, these include:

    Backlink Analytics
    Backlink Audit
    Link Building Tool
    Bulk Analysis

Ashley Sterling of The Loop Marketing adds, “Our team focuses on the link building/backlink tools provided by Semrush. This tool allows for daily reports on changes, alerts to potential toxic links, and the ability to perform outreach to link prospects.”
Project Dashboard

The Project Dashboard provides you with a summarized view of all the most important data and information you generated through Semrush.

You can connect your current projects and the dashboard will generate the widgets of data from the other features, allowing you to acquire the big picture of your project’s performance.

Jordan McCreery of Ingrained Media says, “The MOST powerful Semrush feature that I rely on daily for tracking and improving client search rankings is the Project Dashboard. Semrush is FULL of amazing tools, the Project Dashboard helps you to visualize all of the data in a summarized area. Your Site Health is shown through Site Audit, Position Tracking monitors your keyword changes, while the Organic Traffic Insights give a big picture of the total traffic in the period.”

Free Semrush Dashboard Templates

When it comes to the variety of SEO features, there aren’t many tools out there that can compare to Semrush.

Semrush offers 50+ research and analytics tools to its users and while you will be able to acquire an abundance of data related to your SEO efforts, you will have to spend a lot of time tracking the changes.

For example, you will have to log in to your Semrush account each week to check out which keywords are dragging the traffic up/down or see which backlinks got broken.

This is why many users choose dashboards as an extra form of help.

Dashboards allow you to connect specific metrics in one place and track organic traffic in real-time, all in a single report.

Here are some free dashboard templates that you can integrate with your Semrush account.

    Semrush Keyword Milestones Dashboard
    Semrush Site Audit Dashboard
    Semrush Keywords and Audits Dashboard
    Semrush Keyword Mission Control Dashboard
    Blog Traffic Distribution Dashboard

Semrush Keyword Milestones Dashboard

The problem it solves: There is a steep drop-off in click rates for content that does not rank in the top 10 results for valuable search terms. According to a study from Advanced Web Ranking, 71% of all searches lead to a click on a page one result on Google. Even more dramatically, 55% of searches result in a click on one of the first three results!

So, marketers can see a big bump in traffic if they can get a high-traffic keyword from position 11 to position 10. And, they should see exponentially better results as their content gets closer to position 1.

Semrush uses a relative metric called “Visibility %” to summarize all your rankings. Since lower keywords are less visible on search engine result pages (SERPs), Semrush give you an estimate relative to your specific keywords. The higher your keyword rankings go, the higher the visibility percentage.

How to use the Semrush Keyword Milestones Dashboard: The left column tracks all top 3 and top 10 keywords related to your domain. This allows you to track your general SEO success since these determine visibility.

The middle column looks at the specific terms where you rank highly. If you rank in the top 3 (or number 1) for a well-trafficked term, you should go into Semrush to see which page is responsible for that high ranking.

The last column aligns visibility with organic traffic from Google Analytics. This is the ‘results’ column. When your visibility percentage goes up, you should see a rise in organic traffic as searchers actually click your links.

Questions it can answer:

    Which keywords are important for organic traffic?
    How does organic traffic change when a keyword crosses a milestone?
    Are your page titles attracting clicks?

Metrics tracked:

    Number of Top 3 Keywords, Daily
    Number of Top 10 Keywords, Daily
    Keywords Ordered by Ranking Movement
    Visibility % on SERP
    Organic Traffic by Sessions

semrush-keyword-dashboard
Semrush Site Audit Dashboard

The problem it solves: Semrush created a Site Audit Score to summarize all the different warnings and errors it finds. Although it ranges from 0-100%, there is no specific score that every site should aim for. The more pages you have, the more errors and warnings you will have. If you need a benchmark, use the tool on your competitors and see how you compare!

Pages Crawled gives you a baseline for all the pages that the crawler bot can find. Unless you recently took down pages on purpose, you do not want this number to trend downwards! That means errors are piling up.

How to use the Semrush audit dashboard: Use this dashboard to communicate your domain’s crawlability as well as any errors you accumulate. Errors are the most severe red flag, followed by warnings and then notices. You can use the crawl depth stats to make sure that most pages are three or less clicks away from the root. Those are the easiest to crawl.

Questions it can answer:

    Are you successfully eliminating toxic backlinks?
    Is your site map easy to crawl?
    Are you keeping warnings, errors, and notices in control as you grow?

Metrics tracked:

    Site Audit Score (%)
    Pages with Issues, Warnings, Errors, Notices
    Pages Crawled
    1 Click, 2 Clicks, 3 Clicks, 4+ Clicks

semrush-site-audit
Semrush Keywords and Audits Dashboard

The problem it solves: This dashboard examines all the key domain statistics provided by Semrush. It factors in both positive stats like keyword ranking, and negative stats, like errors that affect your domain authority and crawlability. Estimated traffic is Semrush’s internal metric that multiplies the volume of searches for each term by the click-through rate of that particular position.

How to use the Semrush Keywords and Audits dashboard: Make sure that any hard work on content marketing is supported by a clean, crawlable site. You do not want to put hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars into content marketing simply to be handcuffed by an uncrawlable site.

Questions it can answer:

    How visible is your domain?
    What are your top keywords?
    Are you cleaning up errors, warnings and notices?
    Does your SEO work increase traffic?

Metrics tracked:

    Visibility Trend
    Estimated Traffic
    Top Keywords by Position
    Links with Errors
    Site Audit Results

semrush-keywords-audits
Semrush Keyword Mission Control Dashboard

The problem it solves: This dashboard gives an overview of all stats related to keywords. It measures the percentage of your site’s traffic that comes from organic sources in the first place. Then, it covers all your organic traffic initiatives, from keywords to visibility to estimated traffic.

How to use the Semrush Keyword Mission Control dashboard: This gives a general overview of your success in generating organic traffic. You can use it to align keyword metrics alongside traffic metrics. If you are successfully ranking highly for more keywords, organic traffic should go up. If it does not, you may want to check your Site Audit.

Questions it can answer:

    How does high-ranking content translate to organic traffic?
    How well are you competing for specific terms?

Metrics tracked:

    Keywords by Position, Volume, and % Change
    Ranking Distribution
    Visibility Trend
    Top Channels by Sessions

semrush-keyword-mission-control
Blog Traffic Distribution Dashboard

The problem it solves: According to our study, 3% of blog posts drive 80% of total blog traffic. And just 0.5% of posts drive 50% of traffic. So, even as your organic traffic builds over many months, you will continue to rely on your top 0.5% of posts. You can use these posts to decide where to focus your content production. Or, you can update/optimize these top posts with better CTAs to drive more leads or product sign-ups.

How to use the Blog Traffic Distribution dashboard: The left column ranks your blog posts based on organic traffic, and shows which posts are rising or falling in search rankings based on changes in traffic. The middle column clearly shows which posts make up a majority of traffic for the entire blog. In the case above, 3 posts make up 60% of traffic! The right column tracks all organic search traffic and the keywords that drive it.

Questions it can answer:

    Which posts should undergo historical optimization?
    Which keywords drive the most traffic?
    Does your blogging strategy focus on high-performing topics?

Metrics tracked:

    Top Keywords by Position
    Top Blog Posts by Sessions, Monthly
    Organic Search Traffic, Daily

That means you can also see statistics of local or national competitors and any other company you’re interested in. You get insights into areas you’re doing well, how your competitors are doing, and where you can improve.

Traffic Analysis

Evaluating website traffic is essential in marketing. You want to know the people visiting your website and where they are coming from. Thanks to SEMrush’s traffic analytic feature, you can tell how many site visits you’ve had for a particular period. Even better, it gives you specific statistics on how many pages people viewed with each visit, how long a person stayed on your site, and the bounce rate. You can also view trends via traffic sources, devices, and other options.

Position Tracker

Another great SEMrush feature is the position tracking tool. Create a list of important keywords for your business that you would want to feature on Google’s front page. This can include the services or products you sell. Select a mobile or desktop and your service area, which can be a city, zip code, or state. The tool will let you know where you rank in a specified area. You will see the pages those keywords rank on and the search volume data. You can also include your competitors and see how they rank using the same keywords.

Market Insights

Checking market insights will help you gain a competitive advantage. SEMrush has a market explorer tool that lets you identify your competitors and leaders in the industry. Through it, you can understand what steps to take to increase your market share. You’ll also see the domains that get more site visits, the industry traffic generation strategies, and audience demographics like gender, age, geo-location, and interests.
Benefits of SEMrush

Here are some of the advantages of using SEMrush.

You might also learn a few keywords that have helped drive traffic toward your competitors’ sites.

Helps Generate New Content Ideas

For instance, entering a keyword such as ‘content marketing’ into this tool will give you efficient subtopics like marketing techniques or content marketing strategies. Under each topic, you get examples of how other people covered these topics. From that, you can pick an idea that’s likely to resonate with your audience.

Helps You Find Valuable Keywords

The keywords you pick are very important when it comes to SEO. Your targeted audience conducts searches using particular keywords to find specific search results. SEMrush helps you identify these keywords so that you can include them in your SEO campaign. The tool also lets you identify the keywords your competitors use, giving insight into where you can improve to reach valuable leads.

SEMrush is an important tool for business owners, internet marketers, bloggers, and almost any other company.

The Semrush SEO Tools to Know About
On-Page SEO

On-page SEO focuses on optimizing web pages to improve their visibility and ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). With Semrush, users can check their “site health,” get a clear picture of how a Google crawler interacts with their website, audit the current SEO of their site, use actionable solutions to fix identified website issues, and improve the ranking of specific pages with tips for link building, content writing, SERP feature targeting, and more.

Keyword research is fundamental to SEO as it helps website owners understand the terms and phrases their target audience is searching for, giving them the insight they need to optimize their content accordingly. Semrush’s keyword tools can help marketers identify the best keywords for their digital marketing strategies, create master lists that outline ongoing strategies, track real-time metrics for up to one thousand unique keywords at once, identify ways to rank for competitor keywords and discover the organic and advertising value of any keyword based on search volume, intent, keyword difficulty, number of results, CPC, competition level, SERP Features, and variations.
Local SEO

Local SEO refers to the process of optimizing a website or online presence to increase visibility and attract targeted traffic from local searches, specifically for businesses targeting customers within a geographical area. There are four primary tools Semrush offers for local SEO: Listing Management, On-Page SEO Checker, Position Tracking, and the Social Media Toolkit. With these features, marketers can analyze industry trends, track daily performance, follow local ranking progress on a ZIP code level, monitor competitor domains, and post updates on multiple online channels from a single platform.
Rank Tracking

Monitoring performance on Google can feel like a full-time gig, which is where Semrush’s rank-tracking tools can help. Instead of manually checking the performance of your pages, Semrush makes it easy to monitor signs that could indicate an update to Google’s algorithm, gather research on the domains with the most organic visibility, and optimize your targeting efforts based on the most accurate data, updated daily.

Link Building

Link prospecting can be one of the harder parts of marketing, especially considering how challenging it is to reach out to prospects in hopes of getting a backlink. That’s where Semrush’s extensive database of backlinks can help. Instead of playing email tag with someone who may not get back to you, Semrush’s dynamic backlink builder can help you track inbound links, find link outreach opportunities based on your competitor’s backlink profiles, and more. Semrush can also help streamline the process of auditing your backlinks, avoiding Google ranking penalties, analyzing competitor performance, and generating outreach campaigns.

How Does Semrush’s Advertising Research Compare with Other Tools?

Semrush’s Advertising Research feature stands out prominently among competitor tools like Google Analytics. While both platforms offer impressive capabilities, a comparative analysis will help illustrate Semrush’s unique selling points further.

semrush-advertising-research

Unlike Google Analytics, which primarily focuses on website traffic data, Semrush’s Advertising Research allows you to delve deeper into competitors’ ad strategies. You get profound insights, such as understanding your competitors’ ad budget, keywords they’re betting on, and where they are placing their ads.

Another remarkable feature of Semrush is its capacity to provide historical data analysis, which is absent in Google Analytics. This tool allows businesses to track trends and changes in competitors’ advertising strategies over a considerable period, offering invaluable insights for crafting impactful and dynamic ads.

Though both tools have their strengths, Semrush serves as a powerful ally for businesses that want comprehensive advertising intelligence.

The first ‘P’ represents the Product. This refers to the goods or services you are offering. Understanding your product is crucial as it sets the groundwork for all other aspects of your marketing strategy. A successful marketing campaign begins with a deep comprehension of the product’s features, benefits, and differentiators. When assessing your product, consider the following:

    What need or problem does your product solve?
    How does it stand out from competitors?
    What features and benefits does it offer?
    Is there a unique story behind the product?

Price
The second ‘P’ pertains to Price. Pricing strategies can be complex, with considerations extending beyond mere cost calculations. The price of your product should reflect its value, market demand, and competitive landscape. When evaluating your pricing strategy, take into account:

    What is the perceived value of the product in the eyes of consumers?
    How does your pricing compare to that of competitors?
    Are there opportunities for discounts, bundles, or premium pricing?
    How will pricing changes affect demand and profitability?

Place
The third ‘P’ centers around Place. This encompasses not just the physical location where your product is sold but also distribution channels and market presence. In digital marketing, ‘place’ can be virtually anywhere online. When considering place, focus on:

    The platforms where your target audience is most active
    The logistics of distributing your product
    The user experience journey from discovery to purchase
    The effectiveness of your online presence

Promotion
The final ‘P’ is Promotion. This involves all the methods you use to communicate about your product and persuade customers to make a purchase. Promotion can include advertising, social media marketing, email campaigns, SEO, and more. Key promotional considerations include:

    The messaging that will resonate with your target audience
    The channels that will most effectively reach them
    The timing of campaigns and promotional events
    Integration of promotional activities across various channels

2.   Position Tracker

Position tracking is one of our favorite tools from SEMrush! Compose a list of your most important keywords, which are the products or services you offer, so that you can increase your ranking on the first page of Google. It is important to select desktop or mobile, as well as your service area – this could be a country, state, city, or even a zip code.

3. Analysis of traffic flows

Furthermore, it is important to evaluate how your website performs for each keyword as well as what page of Google shows up for each. Where are your visitors coming from and how are they finding your website? SEMrush’s traffic analytics tool allows you to see how many visitors you had to your site over a specified period of time.

    Set up and manage one SEMrush project
    There are 10 daily inquiries about keyword/competitor research
    Tracking keywords (10 keywords maximum)

SEMrush vs. Google Analytics: How Do They Different?

In the world of internet marketing, SEMrush and Google Analytics are currently the most popular tools. While both offer similar services, they operate in different ways.Since it’s not possible for you to get the internal data of your competitor’s website, the data you get from SEMrush is almost as good as what you get from them.
SEMrush vs Ahrefs: what’s the difference?

As an SEO tool that analyzes competitors’ sites externally, Ahrefs compares more to SEMrush than Google Analytics.

Currently, both of these tools are pretty similar in their features and services, but this wasn’t always the case. Ahrefs was initially only known for its backlink analysis capabilities. The company has nevertheless added a number of new features since then, making it a rival worth considering in the SEO research market.

The metrics that SEMrush and Ahrefs focus on are significantly different. If you’re mostly interested in doing keyword research and analyzing the technical side of SEO (e.g., website health), then SEMrush is the right tool for you.

In contrast, Ahrefs is perfect for digital marketers who spend more time researching backlinks and building links.
 SEMrush’s Powerful Features Will Help You Rank Higher

You can use specific features to improve your search ranking after you understand what SEMrush is and how it works.

There are a number of features in SEMrush, but if you are unfamiliar with the software, it can be difficult to decide which ones to use.

SEMRush Tool for keyword research

Probably the most popular tool on SEMrush for conducting keyword research is the Keyword Magic Tool.

Overview of the keywords

An overview of a keyword is used to gain insight into its search volume, its result number, its intent, its CPC, its level of competition, and its estimated value.

Beginner digital marketers will find this tool especially useful to learn what keywords they should target and how to research them.

Finding keywords where your website ranks on Google’s 2nd page is the most important SEMrush feature for tracking and improving your search rankings. If you locate these pages and keywords, you should add them to your post’s H2, H3 tags as well as the copy. Internal links with the right anchor text can also lead to that page from other pages of your website. You will soon move up to the first page of Google search results.

Always write for your readers, not for your search engine. You should always make sure to include relevant and logical keywords in your content. Avoid stuffing your posts with keywords because this will harm your user experience and readability.”

SEMrush Alert for keywords

It used to take digital marketers hours to check every keyword to see if it had improved or declined in the past few weeks, which is quite time-consuming.

With the Keyword Alert tool, users are informed of all the latest changes regarding their ranking and are provided with a free alert system. SEMrush sends you an email each time a keyword ranking changes in your report.
Tagging keywords

Tag groups are tracked using the Keyword Tagging tool. There is also a share of voice estimate, traffic estimates, and positional estimates. Your tagged keywords can be analyzed to see how well they are performing.

A wide range of overview metrics enable you to quickly gain insight into your website’s online presence.

You will see things like paid search traffic, organic search traffic, backlinks, and more. When you receive the overview, you can open the module-specific reports to further analyze the data.

Keeping an eye on a variety of competitors can help you determine the top trends in your industry, enabling you to ensure that your brand has a presence for topics that rivals are being found for online. You can also keep tabs on any competitor initiatives that aren’t quite delivering the results you want, enabling you to learn from others’ mistakes and improve your chances of success.

For professionals in marketing, research, and sales, Traffic Analytics is extremely useful.

Here is what one of the marketers had to say about the traffic percentage metric, one of the most popular metrics in this feature.

Traffic Estimates

This is an estimate of the traffic to a website as a result of a particular keyword. Position tracking reports include this metric. You can visualize traffic data cumulatively rather than daily totals for this metric. This makes it easier to recognize patterns.
The most popular keywords by position

On a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, you can monitor fluctuations in your top keywords’ rankings using the table layout.
Top three keywords

A domain’s top three search result keywords are based on the total number of keywords. In this table layout, you can visualize keywords from the top ten, twenty, and hundred.

Trends can also be observed using the line graph.
Keyword Positions by Percentage

The line graph above also illustrates the position percentage of top keywords.

Distributed Rankings

You can view all of the top metrics in one table with this multi-metric Datablock, which shows Keywords in Top 10, Keywords in Top 100, Keywords in Top 20, Keywords in Top 3, and Estimated Traffic.
Competitor average position

This is your campaign’s overall average ranking for all the keywords in it divided by the performance of your competitors.
Keywords with the highest volume

According to estimated volume, these are the top keywords. Knowing this helps marketers plan their content and PPC campaigns.
Accessibility Trends

Using the keywords added to your Position Tracking Project, you can calculate how visible a domain, subdomain, or URL is.

Templates for the Semrush dashboard

It’s hard to find any other SEO tool that comes close to SEMrush’s variety of features.

With SEMrush’s 50+ research and analytics tools, you can acquire a great deal of SEO data, but tracking the changes will take a lot of time.

To see which keywords are dragging traffic up/down or which backlinks are broken, you will have to log into your SEMrush account each week.

Therefore, dashboards are a great way to provide extra assistance to users.

A dashboard allows you to track organic traffic in real-time and connect specific metrics in one place.

Here are some free SEMrush dashboard templates you can use.

    Milestones Dashboard for SEMRush Keywords
    Dashboard for SEMRush Site Audits
    SEMRush Keywords and Audits Dashboard
    Dashboard for keyword mission control in SEMRush
    Dashboard for traffic distribution on blogs

Milestones Dashboard for SEMRush Keywords

When content doesn’t rank in the top 10 for valuable search terms, click rates drop dramatically. 71% of all searches on Google result in a click on a page one result, according to a study from Advanced Web Ranking. The first three results of five-out-of-ten searches are clicked on by over half of people!

If marketers can move a high-traffic keyword from position 11 to position 10, they can see a significant increase in traffic. The closer their content gets to position 1, the better the results they should see.

All rankings are summarized by a relative metric called “Visibility %.”. For lower keywords, SEMRush will provide an estimate of visibility relative to the specific keyword. Visibility percentage increases with the position of your keyword.

SEMRush site audit dashboard

It solves the problem by creating a Site Audit Score that sums up all of the warnings and errors SEMrush identifies. No site should aim for a specific score out of 0-100%, even though it ranges from 0-100%. There will be more errors and warnings the more pages you add. You can use the tool to benchmark your performance against your competitors!

The Crawled Pages provides you with a baseline of all the pages that can be found by the crawler. This number shouldn’t trend downward unless you have recently taken down pages on purpose! The result is that errors are accumulating.

You can use the SEMrush audit dashboard to monitor the crawlability of your domain and any errors you accumulate over time. Red flags are errors, warnings, and notices, in that order. With the crawl depth stats, you can ensure that the root is three or fewer clicks away for most pages. The easiest pages are those that are three clicks away.

Among the questions it can answer are:

    Are you removing toxic links successfully?
    Can your site map be crawled easily?
    How do you manage warnings, errors, and notices as your company grows?

Tracked metrics include:

    Score (%) from Site Audits
    Warnings, errors, and issues pages
    Web pages crawled

Audits and Keywords Dashboard for SEMRush

Using this dashboard, you can see all the important domain statistics provided by SEMrush.

Both positive and negative statistics, such as keywords ranking and errors, are taken into account. A term’s estimated traffic is calculated by multiplying the number of searches for each term by the click-through rate of that particular position in SEMrush.

Make sure that your hard work on content marketing is supported by a clean, crawlable site using the SEMrush Keywords and Audits dashboard. It doesn’t make sense to spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours in content marketing if your site isn’t crawlable.

It can answer the following questions:

    Are you visible on the web?
    Which keywords are most important to you?
    Is it time to clean up errors, notices, and warnings?
    Can you increase traffic with SEO?

Tracked metrics include:

    Accessibility Trends
    Traffic Estimates
    Positions of the top keywords
    Errors in links

Dashboard for SEMRush Keyword Mission Control

It provides an overview of all keyword-related statistics. In the first place, it measures the proportion of traffic your site receives from organic sources. This is followed by a list of all organic traffic initiatives, including keywords, visibility, and estimates.

An overview of your SEO success is provided by the Keyword Mission Control dashboard in SEMRush. By aligning keyword metrics with traffic metrics, you can gain an understanding of your SEO success. Ranking highly for more keywords should increase organic traffic. If not, this may indicate a problem with your site.

Questions that can be answered by it:

    High-ranking content affects organic traffic in what ways?
    What are your chances of winning specific terms?

Tracked metrics include:

    Positions, volumes, and percent changes for keywords
    Distribution of rankings
    Visual Trends
    In terms of sessions, these are the top channels

Dashboard for traffic distribution on blogs

Our study shows that 3% of blog posts drive 80% of traffic to blogs. Meanwhile, just 0.5% of posts drive 50% of traffic to blogs. You will continue to depend on your top 0.5% of posts even as your organic traffic grows over many months. Depending on these posts, you can decide what content to produce. Alternatively, you could add better CTAs to these posts to drive more sign-ups or leads.

The left column of the Blog Traffic Distribution dashboard displays the organic traffic rank of your blog posts, as well as which posts are increasing or decreasing in search rankings based on traffic changes. It is easy to see which posts make up most of the blog’s traffic in the middle column. 60% of the traffic is accounted for by three posts. In the right column are the keywords that drive organic search traffic.

Among the questions it can answer are:

    Should historical optimization be performed on which posts?
    What are the most popular keywords?
    Blog about high-performing topics as part of your strategy?

The metrics tracked are :

    The most popular keywords by position
    Sessions’ most popular blog posts, by month
    The volume of organic search traffic each day

Databox lets you monitor and report SEO data easily

Even the most experienced digital marketers find it challenging to stay on top of Google’s constantly changing algorithm and new technology.

Even though SEMrush can be an extremely useful tool in this respect, there simply are too many metrics and data to keep an eye on, and the task of following the changes becomes overwhelming very quickly.
This process can be simplified by using Databox.

You can create one dashboard that includes all the data you receive from SEMrush’s different features by connecting your SEMrush account to Databox. Monitoring and reporting SEO data will be a lot easier and faster with this method.

You will be able to track changes in one place, instead of logging into every SEMrush account and manually checking every detail, thanks to Databox.

Additionally, by using some of our advanced visualization features, all the data you gather becomes much more understandable. With beautiful custom charts and graphs, the dry data is transformed into information that can be understood by anyone.

Final Thought!

A powerful and adaptable tool, SEMrush allows users to find information relevant to their clients. The report provides insight into the clients’ industry and highlights SEO’s importance in the marketing field.

Among the most useful aspects of SEMrush, I found the keyword research tool, the competitor audit, and the Tools section. The SEO industry is known for its fast pace.  Due to this, there are always new tools available in the marketplace, and sometimes it can seem as if there are too many options.  Even if you are time-limited, SEMrush is a tool I would recommend to anyone working in search, regardless of how busy they are.

There you have it! SEO tool Semrush is not the same as the rest. ",https://appsaware.com/features-and-benefits-of-semrush/,SemRush

Massive Review of Semrush: Tools, Tips, and More

Disclaimer: The links in this article may provide IMPACT with compensation for signups. This is no way effects IMPACT's recommendation of SEMrush.

Here at IMPACT, we always have our ears to the ground listening for the distant rumbling of the next great tool that will improve the way we do digital business -- especially when it has to do with keyword research, SEO best practices, link building,  website health, and keeping a watchful eye on our competitors.

Fortunately for us (and you), SEMrush is an expansive tool that covers all of those facets and more.

In fact, there's so much to SEMrush that covering all of it would take at least a full day of reading.

So, for the sake of brevity, we'll discuss some of the key features and tools that we use the most often.
Featured tools of SEMrush

Below, you'll find list of the most common SEMrush tools we use regularly to help us in our marketing efforts.
Keyword research

We first turned to SEMrush with high hopes that it could help us better identify and target new keywords we’d like to rank for as well as show us keywords our clients' websites were already ranking for.

SEMrush has many tools to help users research keywords and blog article topics. From the new Keyword Magic tool, to the Topic Research tool, to the Organic Research tool, you're bound to find a plethora of keywords to build content around for years to come.
Keyword magic tool

This is probably my favorite keyword research tool in the SEMrush suite. In fact, it's my favorite keyword research tool period.

With over two million keywords in its data base, you're sure to find tons of keywords for your business.

You can also create up to 50 target keyword lists if you're helping multiple clients or if your business has many facets.

Simply type in ANY keyword (although I recommend typing in a short tail keyword) and you'll get instant results.

I did a quick search for ""content marketing"" to see what keywords I might want to pursue.

semrush keyword magic tool results

As you can see, from a quick search I can review over 116,380 keywords containing ""content marketing"".

I get helpful data such as:

    Long-tail keywords to pursue
    Average monthly volume of searches
    A trend graph
    Keyword difficulty
    CPC (average cost to advertise for the keyword)
    Competition for entering Adwords auctions
    Number of SERP Features found for the keyword

You can also see a table to the left helping break down commonly used keywords associated with ""content marketing."" Like over 880 searches contain the word ""strategy.""

You also have the option to check the ""questions"" box which will give you all the who, what, why, when, where, and how questions people type in for that keyword.

Now, all those results can be overwhelming and hard to parse through. Simply add a check into the box next to the keywords you find valuable and you can send them to the Keyword Analyzer tool for future use.
Keyword Analyzer tool

The keyword analyzer tool lets you further explore up to 1,000 selected keywords of your choosing.

From here you can:

    segment keywords further for analysis
    export them to a spreadsheet
    send them to other tools like the position tracking tool.

semrush keyword analyzer tool-min
Position Tracking tool

Once you've figured out the keywords you really want to track (whether you already have pages targeting them or you're planning on creating some), you'll want to add them to the position tracking tool.

Here you get weekly updates on how you and your competitors are ranking for those keywords.

Another really cool feature is it will show you all the various SERP Features the keyword is triggering and who has those SERP Features.

You can review the specific pages you are ranking for those keywords to see if they need improvement.

You can stalk your competitors' landing pages to see what they're doing to help you get new ideas for your pages.

And one of my favorite features of the Position Tracking tool, especially if you're a local business, is you can Geo target those keywords to see how you're doing at a local search level rather than rely on your national rankings.

semrush position tracking tool-min


Domain Overview tool

With SEMrush, you don’t have to stop at researching new keywords. You can also learn a ton of information about your own website including keywords you already rank for.

Oftentimes, you may not even realize some of the keywords that are bringing traffic to your site, or the volume of traffic those keywords are bringing you.

To gather information about your own domain, simply enter your root domain into the Domain Overview tool.

semrush domain overview tool-min



­

Before moving on, one thing that should be noted is that in SEMrush’s domain overview of a site, where it shows your monthly traffic, those numbers do not accurately reflect your site’s total monthly traffic.

Rather, it’s giving organic and paid search traffic from keywords that SEMrush has in its database of 120 million keywords. They use an algorithm to estimate your monthly traffic based on number of keywords, position of keywords, and average CTR of those keywords.

Your website traffic may be much higher when you calculate in direct traffic, social media traffic, and traffic from email campaigns.

With that said, let’s take a look at some of the amazing metrics SEMrush can offer in their domain search when you type in your website address:

    An overview of the amount of traffic that keywords known to SEMrush are bringing to your site through organic traffic.
    The amount of traffic you might be bringing in with paid search.
    Number of backlinks from referring domains
    Visual representations of sources for organic and paid keywords.
    A graph showing traffic by organic and paid sources over time (can choose 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or all time).
    The top 5 organic keywords that are bringing traffic to your site. You can click into this section for a ton more analytics (more on these metrics below).
    A graph showcasing organic position distribution, e.g., how many of your keywords rank in the top 3, how many rank in positions 4-10, 11-20, etc. up to the top 100 results.
    Who, based on traffic and overlapping keywords, are your top organic competitors. Many of the competitors listed may not even be ones you knew about. More on the organic competitors later.
    A graph showcasing a competitive position map based on number of keywords and organic search traffic
    A chart showing the top paid keywords bringing traffic to the site (can be expanded to view a full report for more metrics
    A graph showing paid position distribution of the keyword ads you target.
    A chart showing your main paid competitors (top 5 are displayed. More info can be gathered by clicking into the chart).
    A graph showing your competitive positioning map relative to how many paid keywords you, and your competitors are targeting as well as traffic brought in from PPC keywords.
    A sampling of some of your PPC ads
    Some of the backlinks that refer to your site, what those sites are and the anchor text and URL that those backlinks link to.
    The top anchor texts used in backlinks bringing referring traffic to your site.
    Referring domains that are driving traffic to your site sorted by those with the most backlinks pointing to your webpages.
    You most popular indexed pages that are back-linked by other domains.

And remember, all of this information is just an overview of the metrics.

To learn more about each set of data, you simply click on whatever metrics interest you to view full reports.

While we’re not going to get into every possible metric point (we don’t want to spoil your future exploration with SEMrush), we will discuss some of those that we use most frequently.
Organic Research tool

In the Organic Research tool you can learn a lot about the keywords you, or your competitors, currently rank for.

In the Overview tab, you get a nice graph showing your keyword growth over time. You can change this graph to show all top 10 page results, top 5 page results, top two page results, first page results, and even top three results.

organic research overview

In the Positions tab, you get a complete table of ALL the keywords you currently rank for in the top 100 results.

organic research positions-min

Here we can see a full set of keywords that SEMrush has information on that is bringing traffic to a website.

By default, SEMrush lists the keywords in order of those bringing the highest volume of monthly traffic. However, other data points can be used to sort the keywords such as:

    Position the keyword has for organic search results with an arrow showing the previous position.
    The difference in position gains or losses compared to the last crawl.
    The estimated number of monthly searches for that keyword.
    The Cost Per Click to advertise for the keyword.
    The URL page the keyword is associated with.
    The CPC average.
    The competitive density of the keyword for those wishing to advertise for it.
    The total number of indexed URL’s that contain the keyword
    Trends over time by popularity of searches
    The SERP, or snapshot of the first page of results in a search engine.
    And when the keyword’s data was last updated.

Note: It can take SEMrush several weeks to recrawl a keyword in this tool. If you're looking for more up-to-date information, move the keyword to the Position Tracking tool.

Checking out this feature is a great way to see exactly the keywords that are bringing you traffic, and how much of your total traffic they’re bringing. Oftentimes you may even find keywords that are performing very strongly for your site that you were not previously aware of, allowing you to retarget those keywords for better efficiency.
Keyword Gap tool

Another awesome tool found within Domain Overview is the Keyword Gap tool. ­

The Keyword Gap tool really helps you see how your website stacks up against others in your space that are targeting some of the same keywords as you.

semrush keyword gap tool-min

You can enter up to five websites at a time, but I recommend it's best to start with head-to-heads of your website vs a top competitor.

What you'll get with the Keyword Gap tool is (by default) a list of keywords both you and your competitor(s) have in common. You'll get to see your ranking for the keyword vs their ranking.

You'll also get information like volume, difficulty to rank for, CPC, and Adwords competition.

Another way to use the tool is to change the Venn Diagram between the websites so you can look at keywords your competitor has that you don't rank for at all.

Use the Keyword Gap tool to find keywords you rank for below your competitor and make changes to those pages to improve your rankings.

Or look for keywords they have that you don't and scrape for new content ideas.
Website review tools

If you're wanting to know how well your website and website copy is performing, SEMrush has a whole suite of tools for these kinds of metrics.
Site Audit tool

As if being able to check out all of your keywords, your competitors' keywords, and the amount of traffic you’re bringing in isn’t enough, you can also run a site audit in SEMrush to see if there’s any problems occurring with your site that may hinder it’s performance.

semrush site audit-min

In the image above we can see a client of ours' website is scoring a pretty decent 79%.

But that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement.

We've got at least 6 errors, 388 warnings, and 1,245 notices we can review to improve performance.
Backlinks Analytics tool

Backlinks are still one of the most important signals to search engines to help them determine the quality of pages.

While the copy itself is still the most important metric, search engines look to see how other people and websites feel about the quality of the content.

Think about it, you wouldn't link to a page that held zero value for your audience to follow. Why would you send them somewhere that didn't help them further.

Instead, you'd link to high-quality content that would be valuable for them to read.

In the Backlink Analytics tool, you can review the total backlinks to your (or a competitors website), which pages are being linked to, where those links are coming from, and how your total backlinks are growing over time.

semrush backlink analytics-min

Remember, you can also use this tool to check out where your competitors are getting links from and use these as opportunities for outreach.
Backlink Audit tool

So now that you know how many backlinks you have and which domains are linking to your pages, how well can you trust those links?

Are they from reputable sources?

Do you have a bunch of links from toxic sources pointing to your website?

Even though you may have not created the incoming link yourself, too many toxic backlinks that haven't been disavowed makes Google think you don't practice good housekeeping.

Toxic backlinks can hurt the reputation of your own site, so you'll want to review your backlinks and disavow highly toxic links.

Use the Backlink Audit tool to comb through your list of toxic backlinks.

semrush backlink audit tool-min


Rating for SEMrush

All in all, SEMrush is an amazing tool that can provide an overabundance of information for anyone looking to optimize their website, find the most profitable keywords to target, and/or uncover loads of information about their competitors.

From what we’ve studied (and hopefully you can now see for yourself) SEMrush is easily the best SEO keywords tool available on the market right based on the immense amount of information and metrics available for view.

However, SEMrush may not be best for the casual user as it can take quite a bit of time getting comfortable with finding all of the useful data one can compile to improve their site and keyword strategy.

Fortunately, SEMrush offers tons of resources in the forms of whitepapers, a comprehensive FAQ page, video tutorials, and regular webinars for users of all skill levels. And their support team offers detailed, helpful answers in a timely manner.

For us here at IMPACT, we easily give this amazing tool 5 out of 5 stars and will be using it for ourselves, recommending it to our clients, and recommending it to anybody who asks us about it. It really is that awesome.

With all of that said, there is still one question to address...

    Check backlinks’ types; Every backlink identified by the SEMrush website link checker is provided with a nofollow or follow note, so you know if a link will transfer any link juice to your website.

Here are different ways to use SEMrush to get SEO data
Find all of a website’s rankings

Enter the root domain into SEMrush’s search bar. Do not include “http://” or “www.” else SEMrush will default to rankings for that specific page (more on this in a bit). Click on the Organic Research sidebar, which defaults to the ‘Positions’ submenu.

Scroll down to “Organic Search Positions” where you’ll see a comprehensive list of keywords, their search volumes, which of your pages rank and in what position (plus other relevant details).
Find all of a subdomain’s rankings

Start with the same process as above. Under “Organic Search Positions” create a filter. To find out what pages on rcs.seerinteractive.com, a sub-domain of our main website, are ranking, we’ll select Include > URL > Containing > rcs.seerinteractive.com

You could also create the filter Include > URL > Begins with > rcs. This would be less specific, but helpful if you wanted to find rankings for multiple subdomains that began with the same string of text.

If your blog is located by itself on a subdomain, this is how you can find where your blog pages rank.

CLICK HERE to try it for 7 days so that you can see the results for yourself.
Find all of a specific page’s rankings

In the search bar, enter the full page URL, including the HTTP prefix. SEMrush will recognize that you’ve entered a page URL and only show  keywords/rankings for that URL.

Find rankings for all URLs with a specific word/phrase in them

Let’s say you want to find all URLs with a specific word in them, such as “seo.”

Create the filter: Include > URL > Containing > seo

If you have multiple subfolders across different URL structures, you can use this method to find their rankings. Say you have seerinteractive.com/philly/seo/ and seerinteractive.com/san-diego/seo/ and you want to find rankings for pages in those seo subfolders, but you don’t want to include pages outside those folders that might have seo in the URL (such as seerinteractive.com/blog/seo-tips/).

Create the filter: Include > URL > Containing > /seo/
Find all this information in another country

What’s VERY cool about SEMrush is that for international SEO, you can find any of this information for different Google databases. Up top, select one of 28 different countries to see different results.

CLICK HERE to try it for 7 days so that you can see the results for yourself.
Find a site’s estimated organic traffic history

SEMrush will show you a site ’s estimated organic traffic based on rankings, but I take this metric with a grain of salt. It is, at best, an approximation given the available data and should be treated as such.

You can use this to evaluate a competitor’s potential traffic, but it’s more useful in terms of traffic trends – a big drop could indicate that a site was affected by an algorithm change. Gains could suggest that a site has put greater emphasis on their SEO efforts or launched new campaigns to rank higher or rank for more keywords.

Find rankings for a specific keyword

Type your desired keyword into the search bar up top and SEMrush will present detailed information about that keyword, including results 1-100.

Find keyword suggestions for keyword research

Type your starting keyword into the search bar, scroll down to the “Phrase Match Keywords” section and click “View full report.”

This will show you other keywords containing the keyword you entered. This is by no means highly conclusive but can give you a good starting point.

CLICK HERE to try it for 7 days so that you can see the results for yourself.
Find keywords with a specific number of search results

This is probably one of SEMrush’s least used features, but it’s easy to find keywords with a certain number of total search results. Create the filter: Include > Results > (Greater than|Less than|Equal) > 6,000,000 (or whatever number you want).

Find keywords with/without a specific word in them

Similar to URL, you can filter by keyword contents. You might want to find where a site ranks for queries containing the keyword “seo.” Create the filter: Include > Keyword > Word matching > seo.

This ensures the results will only include strings where “seo” is present as its own word, and not as part of another word. If you want to be less specific, you can create the filter: Include > Keyword > Containing > seo.

Other options include “Begins with” and “Ends with”

CLICK HERE to try it for 7 days so that you can see the results for yourself.
Find out who your competitors are

By selecting the “Competitors” tab under “Organic Research” you can find all kinds of information about search competitors. If you’ve done your due diligence, you probably already know who a site’s competitors are. A college for example, might say “our competitors are University X, University Y and University Z.”

That’s great, and you could compare just those four sites, but looking at competitor data from SEMrush might also reveal that non-university websites such as U.S. News & World Report rank highly for education-related keywords. SEMrush will provide such data as:

    What other websites share common keywords.
    The percentage (and raw number) of keywords these other sites have in common.
    The total number of keywords other competitors rank for (including non-mutual keywords).

Clicking on any of these results will take you to SEMrush’s Domain vs. Domain analysis tool.
Compare rankings for 5 domains at once

If you want to compare a website’s rankings to that of its competitors, Domain vs. Domain makes it very easy. This varies from the “Competitors” tab in that it allows you to select specific domains to compare.

CLICK HERE to try it for 7 days so that you can see the results for yourself.

First make sure you’ve selected “Advanced Mode” otherwise you’re limited to 3 domains. Next, enter the different domains into each box and click “Go.”

SEMrush will essentially perform a very basic gap analysis, identifying keywords where all of the domains rank, and reporting on what position each domain ranks in. It does not, however, tell you what URL is ranking for each domain, which makes it difficult to manually compare pages.

In order to get a more in-depth look, you can still use SEMrush but will need to export rankings for each of the domains and use spreadsheets and VLOOKUP to compare URLs.
Find all backlinks to an entire site (root domain, including all subdomains)

Enter a site’s root domain into the search box and make sure the Root Domain box is selected below the search box. SEMrush will default to a snapshot overview page but by selecting the Backlinks submenu on the Backlinks sidebar you can see a full list of backlinks. This list operates similar to the Positions database and will find all of the backlinks to the root domain that SEMrush has in its index.

Find all backlinks to a domain (excluding all subdomains)

By selecting the Domain box below the search bar, you can instruct SEMrush to exclude all subdomain backlinks. A word of caution: this will exclude backlinks to www. pages (since www. is a technically a subdomain).

CLICK HERE to try it for 7 days so that you can see the results for yourself.
Find all backlinks to a specific subdomain

If you want to look at to a specific n subdomain, select the Domain box and enter that subdomain into the search bar. Do not include the HTTP header or SEMrush will default to backlinks for that specific page.

Find all backlinks to a specific URL

Enter a specific page URL into the search bar. Including the HTTP header will instruct SEMrush to look at page-specific metrics.

CLICK HERE to try it for 7 days so that you can see the results for yourself.
Find how many other internal/external links (to any site/page) are on a source URL

Within its list of backlinks, an interesting metric SEMrush provides is the number of internal and external links present on the source URL. A high volume of external links could be an indicator that the site is low-quality or directory-focused.

Find the estimated age of a backlink

A common obstacle with backlink indexes is that they’re sometimes out of date. The First Seen and Last Seen columns can be useful to determine the estimated age of a backlink, although it’s still wise to use Screaming Frog’s custom search feature to crawl a list of backlink source pages and see if they’re still present.

58,Sales Marketing,"What Is a Marketing Strategy?

A marketing strategy is an overarching guide to how your business positions and promotes itself to prospects and customers to reach your company goals.

Consider it the roadmap that outlines your business’s fundamental approach to engaging with your audience, communicating your values (and value proposition), and driving sales.

And your marketing strategy should be:

    Clear
    Concise
    Specific
    Long-term

Pro tip ​​​​​

Document your marketing strategy in writing and share a copy with your team for easy reference.
Marketing Strategy vs. Marketing Plan: What’s the Difference?

The terms “marketing strategy” and “marketing plan” often get mixed up.

Here’s why:

They’re closely related concepts that both inform your marketing activities.

    Marketing strategy definition: The big-picture vision for how you’ll achieve your business’s goals. It sets the stage for how you’ll position your brand, who you’ll target, and the brand values you’ll uphold.

    Marketing plan definition: The step-by-step details outlining how you’ll bring your marketing strategy to life. It focuses on specific processes, tools, and tactics needed to reach your business goals.

An infographic comparing marketing strategy and marketing plan definitions

For example:

A new energy drink company does extensive research and identifies pickleball players as its ideal customers. And a market segment that’s projected to grow.

Then, the company formulates a marketing strategy focused on appealing to those players by promoting the idea of playfulness, having fun, and not taking life too seriously.

From there, they develop a marketing plan that details how they’ll execute their strategy. Step by step.

Through research and analysis, the team identifies four channels to focus their marketing efforts on that fit within their budget:

    Social media via Instagram
    Website via blog posts that use SEO best practices
    Email via an existing list of subscribers
    Paid search ads via Google Ads

The plan then details the specific actions that will drive their strategy goals.

Such as:

    Hire video creators to produce funny videos of people playing other sports with pickles as substitutes for traditional balls. Then, post the content on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok to connect with audiences and influencers on those platforms.
    Employ freelance writers to create blog articles optimized for keywords that pickleball players would likely search for. And write email marketing campaigns that include links to these new articles.
    Contract with a pay-per-click (PPC) ads expert to develop a paid search campaign for keywords related to enhancing pickleball player performance

Get the idea?

Both the strategy and the plan are crucial for success.
Why Is a Marketing Strategy Important?

Having an established (and documented) marketing strategy provides direction that ensures all your activities are unified and working toward the same goal.

Without one, you’ll deal with wasted resources, misaligned efforts, and missed opportunities.

The power of an effective marketing strategy lies in its ability to:

    Drive purposeful action: It connects your marketing endeavors with overarching business objectives to ensure each initiative contributes to long-term goals
    Foster team alignment: A marketing strategy allows all teams to rally behind a shared vision to accelerate growth, enhance sales, and improve customer retention
    Help measure results: A clear strategy provides a framework for reviewing performance, seeing whether your tactics align, and knowing if they’re driving toward your end goal

With the AI Marketing Strategy app, you can access frameworks for goal setting and marketing strategy for every step of the marketing funnel. Plus, you get access to an AI tool that creates copy, graphics, and more, all in one.

7 Steps for Creating a Comprehensive Marketing Strategy

Whether you’re crafting a marketing strategy and plan for the first time or you want a refresher, it’s helpful to follow these steps.
1. Set Measurable Goals

Defining clear marketing goals that contribute to the larger company goals allows you to measure your efforts. And determine whether you’re on track.

The SMART framework offers a simple approach to goal setting. It states that goals should be:

    Specific: Keep goals clear, concise, and detailed. Define exactly what you’re setting out to achieve.
    Measurable: Set criteria for measuring your goals’ progress and success. Establish the metrics you’ll use to track and evaluate performance. Like number of site visitors, engagement rate, and conversions.
    Actionable: Ensure clear steps can be taken and determine the workflows and investments necessary to complete your goals. Consider time, budget, and tools.
    Relevant: Align goals with broader organizational objectives. Such as raising revenue, boosting brand awareness, and increasing customer loyalty.
    Time-bound: Instill a sense of urgency and stay focused by establishing time frames with clear deadlines. Decide when actions must be taken. And when performance must be measured.

An infographic by Semrush listing what SMART marketing goals stand for

For example:

By applying the SMART framework, you could set a goal of getting 35% more leads through your website pop-ups by the end of Q3.
2. Conduct Market Research and Identify Your Target Audience

Doing market research gives you insight into the overall market landscape and who the audience is. Which impacts your marketing strategy.

So, where should you begin?

Semrush’s Market Explorer allows you to benchmark yourself against your competitors and learn details about target audiences.

Open the tool, make sure the “Create List” tab is selected, and enter at least three competitors’ domains. And click “Create and analyze.”
""cuisinart.com,"" ""breville.com"" and ""kitchenaid.com"" entered into Market Explorer search

Note ​​​​​​

The location is set to “Worldwide” by default, but you can set it to any country you’d like to refine your market research.

You’ll then be taken to the “Overview” report for a high-level look at the market. Including the level of consolidation, the market size, and the total amount of website traffic the market receives.
Market Explorer overview report

Scroll down to “Domain vs Market Dynamics” to take a closer look at how each competitor stacks up against the larger market.
“Domain vs Market Dynamics” section in Market Explorer

Now, head to the “Audience” tab.

You’ll be able to see a ton of information about the audience. Including their educational level, interests, social media preferences, and most frequently visited domains.
Market Explorer audience report

Then, use the insights you gain from Market Explorer to create in-depth customer profiles (also known as buyer personas) to get a clearer picture of your target audience.

These are fictional but data-driven profiles of your ideal customers.

Semrush’s buyer persona templates can help you create your own customer profiles based on your research.

Click “Create Your Free Buyer Personas.”
Semrush Persona landing page

Then, click the image that best represents your ideal customers.
An image selected under ""Choose your persona"" section

Next, select “Default template.”
""Default template"" selected under ""Choose template"" section

Now you can start filling in your buyer persona details. Including a fictitious name, bio, and demographics. And crucial details like their frustrations, goals, and factors influencing buying decisions.
Semrush Persona template page

If you’ve been in business for a while, consider additional research methods like surveys, feedback forms, and social media analytics (if you’ve been using social media to promote your business).

Note

These tactics will give you an idea of who your current customers (and social followers) are. Which you can compare to the audience data you get from Market Explorer. To see if your present marketing efforts are aligned with attracting your ideal customers.

It’s also a good idea to look into individual competitors using the Domain Overview tool. To learn more about their online presence.

In the tool, enter a competitor’s domain and click “Search.”
""www.cuisinart.com"" entered into Domain Overview search bar

You’ll get a comprehensive snapshot of the site’s performance. And be able to see metrics like organic (meaning unpaid) traffic, paid search traffic, total backlinks (links from other domains that point to theirs), and more.

Use this data to gain a better understanding of who you’re competing against. And what it will take to stand out.

3. Determine Your Overall Approach

Deciding your overall marketing approach forms the basis of your strategy. Which enables your company to stand out among the competition and connect effectively with your target audience.

Once you’ve set goals and completed your groundwork research, gather the stakeholders who will have a say in determining your marketing strategy. Meaning marketing leadership and leaders from sales, finance, and any other teams involved.

With your goals set and data gathered from the previous steps, collaborate to decide on a marketing strategy approach that makes sense for your company.

Consider evaluating your company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats using a SWOT analysis to help you plan.
An infographic on how to do a SWOT analysis

Every business will have a different approach to marketing strategy. So, your approach represents a conscious choice and commitment to how you’ll achieve your goals.

For example:

A small, luxury beauty company knows it won’t be able to compete against big players by outspending them.

So, they devise a strategy to emphasize what sets them apart by highlighting their dermatologist founder, clean ingredients, and clinical trial results. To appeal to prospects who are willing to invest in better makeup.

With that direction in place, the brand will stay within their marketing budget and can now focus on its messaging, channels, and tactics.
4. Craft Key Brand Messaging

A strong brand message shows what your company stands for, why you’re different, and why people should care. And attracts the right people.

Start with your tone of voice. Our guide on how to define your brand’s tone of voice walks you through the steps. But here’s a quick overview:

    Define your core values by creating a mission statement and communication goals (i.e., adjectives that describe your business)
    Determine your tone of voice by establishing characteristics that define how you want to sound to your target audience (e.g., funny vs. serious, formal vs. casual, respectful vs. irreverent, enthusiastic vs. matter of fact
    Observe your audience (like on social media) to find out how they interact with your content and how they communicate with each other. This will allow you to tweak your voice based on their preferences.
    Set clear brand guidelines (like the example from Adobe below) for correct use across channels

""Voice"" section of Adobe's brand guidelines

Next, use your brand’s tone of voice and buyer personas to shape your messaging. Which conveys how you’ll communicate with your audience to compel them to become customers.

It highlights your company’s value proposition. Which is a concise statement that explains what makes your product or service unique and beneficial compared to competitors. It may also showcase company values, like eco-friendliness, inclusivity, and future-mindedness.
An infographic showing what your product/services’s value proposition is

Your messaging should touch on vocabulary. Including which words to use frequently and which terms to avoid.

It also includes slogans and taglines that help prospects and customers identify your business and what it’s about.

Remember—the best brand messaging is:

    Clear and easy to read and understand
    Consistent across different marketing channels (to a degree)
    Captivating to hold people’s attention
    Connected to people’s values and emotions
    Convincing enough to compel people to buy

Once you’ve sharpened your brand messaging, it’s time to identify which marketing channels and tactics you can use to achieve your strategy.
5. Select Marketing Channels and Tactics

Choosing the right marketing channels and tactics is pivotal. Because even well-planned campaigns can miss their goals if they’re broadcast in spaces that don’t align with your audience.

Content distribution occurs across three broad channel categories:

    Owned channels: The channels your brand controls. Like your website, social media profiles, email newsletters, and apps.
    Earned or shared channels: Third-party channels that share your content or content about your brand. Think guest posts, reviews, and media mentions.
    Paid channels: Channels that involve paying to promote your brand. Including paid search ads, social ads, sponsored content, or influencer/brand partnerships.

An infographic on key types of content distribution channels

When crafting a digital marketing strategy, the channels you’ll use depends on your individual business.

To see which channels have worked for you well in the past (if your company has been around for a while), head to Google Analytics to gather data.

Open the “Traffic acquisition” report to discover which channels are driving traffic to your website.
“Traffic acquisition” report in GA4

Some traffic acquisition channels you might see are:

    Organic search from sources like Google, Bing, and Baidu
    Organic social from sources like Tiktok, Instagram, and Facebook
    Direct traffic from people who type your URL directly into their browser
    Referral traffic from other websites
    Paid search from pay-per-click search campaigns
    Email from links in email messages sent to your subscriber list

To uncover which channels your competitors are using, head to Market Explorer.

Like before, open the tool, select the “Create List” tab. Then, enter at least three competitors’ domains and click “Create and analyze.”

In the “Overview” report, scroll down to the “Domain vs Market Dynamics” module toward the bottom.

There, you’ll find the “Traffic Generation Strategy” data for all competitors you enter.
“Traffic Generation Strategy” section of the report in Market Explorer

Then, scroll to the top and click “Audience” and scroll down to glean which social media platforms your competitors’ audiences prefer.
""Social Media"" charts from the ""Audience"" report in Market Explorer

Let’s say you discover that YouTube is a priority channel because it’s driving massive amounts of traffic to your competitors.

You could then prioritize tactics like optimizing your current YouTube videos’ titles and descriptions with keywords. And creating new content based on users’ comments and feedback.

Tip

The AI Marketing Strategy app has an entire library of proven marketing tactics designed by experts that you can adopt for your own campaigns. Go to the Semrush App Center to try it out.

6. Establish Your Budget and Timelines

Creating a marketing budget that’s aligned with your resources, channels, and tactics is key for putting your plan into action.

Start crafting your budget by distributing it across your highest-priority channels and tactics.

For example:

Say you run a restaurant with a marketing budget of $50,000.

Your priority channels are Tiktok, Instagram, and your website. And your main tactics are creating eye-catching photo and video content of your cuisine and chefs, posting that content on your site and social media, and running paid social ads to attract new customers.

Break your budget down according to your needs, starting with a photographer and videographer to shoot images and clips. This content is key to achieving your goals, so you allocate $8,000 for these efforts.

You also need to hire a web designer to spruce up your website, so you budget up to $5,000 for that.

The remaining funds will be divided to meet your writing needs, the cost of campaigns, etc. It’s also a good idea to keep a contingency fund to cover unexpected expenses.

Of course, this is just one way to go.

Once you’ve determined the numbers, ensure you stay on track and within budget by mapping out timelines.

Using the same restaurant example, it would be important to set deadlines for creating photo and video content, completing your website revamp, and finishing your social media calendar.

And having clear time constraints in place will keep everyone on track to achieve your goals.
7. Track and Monitor Progress

Monitoring your results lets you see what’s performing well and helps you work toward your goals. And determine whether there are optimizations you can make to improve.

The tools you’ll use to measure your performance will depend on which channels and tactics you’re leveraging.

For example:

    Google Analytics measures website/blog performance
    Google Search Console tracks organic search performance
    Google Ads and other platform-specific analytics monitors ads

Another useful measurement method is tracking your site’s organic search rankings with Semrush’s Position Tracking tool.

Open the tool, enter your domain, and click “Set up tracking.”
Position Tracking tool

On the next screen, choose a search engine, device type, language, and your target location. Then, click “Continue To Keywords.”
""Targeting"" window in Position Tracking settings

Now, enter a list of keywords you’d like to target. You can enter them manually or import them from a file or other resource.

Then, click “Start Tracking.”
""Keywords"" window in Position Tracking settings

The tool will then gather data for your target keywords. And you can head to the “Overview” tab to see a dashboard showing where your site currently ranks for them.
""Rankings Overview"" report in Position Tracking tool

You can now monitor how your site ranks for each keyword you’re tracking and observe improvements and setbacks as they arise.

To track your efforts on social media, try Social Analytics. Which lets you monitor metrics across your Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram accounts.

Open the tool and click “+ Add profile” to connect your accounts.
Social Analytics tool

Follow the prompts in the configuration wizard for each profile. And then head to the “Overview” tab to get a high-level look at your follower growth, engagement, and more across your social accounts.
""Overview"" tab in Social Analytics tool

You can also look into the specifics for each profile by clicking on the corresponding tabs.

All of these tools simplify tracking so you can take a data-driven approach to the final piece of the marketing strategy puzzle: iteration and optimization.
Marketing Strategy for Small Businesses

Shaping a marketing strategy for a small business is especially important due to limited resources and the need to rapidly grow.

Here’s what small business owners should consider doing on top of the general marketing strategy steps outlined above:

    Offer personalized customer engagement. Cultivate deeper, personal relationships with your customers. Doing so generates positive word-of-mouth recommendations and online testimonials.
    Invest in local SEO. Emphasize local search engine optimization (SEO) to ensure that your business stands out in your immediate vicinity. Small businesses thrive on local support, and ensuring you’re visible in local search results and directories is key.
    Foster community engagement. Get involved in local events, sponsorships, and collaborations. Not only does this bolster local presence, but it also instills a sense of community trust and loyalty.

Until extremely recently in marketing history, when content primarily existed in paper and ink, the process of creating content was simple: all you had to do was write a semi-interesting article and get it printed in the newspaper. There was a downside, though; the lifespan of these articles was short-lived, ending when the newspaper was tossed. There was also no way to know who actually read your article or the impact that it had.

It goes without saying that the world of content has been completely revolutionized thanks to the internet, where it can now live on forever. This helps you keep a store of great content on your site, which is a huge plus, but it means that everyone else is keeping their content too; your competition for user attention is higher than ever before. It’s not just enough to have an interesting idea and write about it; you need to consider your specific audience and make it possible for them to find your content and share it. This is called content strategy.
What is a Content Marketing Strategy?

To fully understand the concept of a concept marketing strategy, we’ll first need to define “content marketing.”

Content marketing is a branch of marketing that works by sharing valuable materials online to attract and build relationships with a brand’s target audience. The emphasis in content marketing should never be to just promote your products like a sales pitch, but instead to offer valuable, actionable content that your audience will respond to.

Content marketing can help foster relationships with new potential customers, but it can also help capture drive leads and sales, establish you and your brand as an industry authority, improve your credibility, and even help your search engine rankings. Types of content that you can use include: blog posts, videos, images, infographics, ebooks, whitepapers, case studies, guides.

An effective content marketing strategy should identify what exact goals you want to reach and how you plan to accomplish them. Do you want more high-value leads? More sales on your e-commerce site, or purchases of a subscription package?

    A content marketing strategy should identify what exact goals you want to reach and how you plan to accomplish them.

Instead of just blindly creating content off interesting ideas, a content marketing strategy will allow you to incorporate long-term strategies that are designed to drive the specific, measurable results you’re looking for.
7 steps to create content marketing strategy

A content marketing strategy must be thorough, and while your content should be original and new, creating the actual strategy can — and should — be much more formulaic.

To create an incredible content marketing strategy that can reach your audience and get you the results you want, keep reading. Our 7 step approach to developing a content strategy will help you create stronger content that converts more leads, help you accomplish your goals, and make it easier to find your audiences.
Step 1. Analyze your niche

The first thing you should do is realize where you stand in the niche. It means taking into consideration your strengths and weaknesses, and the value you bring to a specific market. In other words, you should conduct a SWOT analysis.

The SWOT method relies heavily on data, so use your analytics tools and data at full force. Look at factors like bounce rates, new visitors vs. returning visitors, acquisition, and site behavior to detect where there’s potential for improvement. It will help you look realistically at where you are now and where you want to be, helping you bridge the two. By turning weaknesses into strengths, seizing opportunities, and minimizing threats, you can create more valuable content and get it in front of your target audience.

Analyzing your competitor’s’ content is essential. On the one hand, their social media profiles can provide useful information about your audience, helping you define which social channels are most popular and discover the most engaging content in your niche.

On the other hand, they help you gain a valuable insight into your competitor’s content strategy. This includes things like how often and what type of content they post, and which social channels they prefer. The SEMrush Social Media Tracker helps you analyze your own content performance as well as your competitors’. It’s good practice to always compare yourself with your competitors to know where you stand.

Step 2. Define your goals

Your content marketing strategy should be centered around the specific results you want to accomplish. To get those results, you need to set and define very clear goals. Do you want to drive sales for specific products, increase brand awareness, and/or get more leads?

Once you know what your goals are, you must define your KPI or key performance indicators. If you want to generate more leads, for example, you can measure how many new leads signed up for your newsletter each month.

When defining your goals and KPI, always utilize the SMART method. The SMART method requires that your goals be Specific, Measurable, Agreed-Upon, Realistic, and Time-Based. Ultimately, your goals can’t account for much if they can’t be measured; saying “I want my readers to all really love this content” is not a specific goal because there is no end result and you can’t measure it.

Instead, you could say “I want to increase brand awareness by increasing our social shares by 250% within the next six months.” This is a specific goal (brand awareness) with set measurable metrics (social shares), can be agreed-upon, is realistic (250% in six months could work), and time-based (six months).

You can have multiple goals that you want to incorporate into your content marketing strategy, but you should have a clear plan for how you’ll accomplish each one.
Step 3. Determine your target audience

To reach your goals with content marketing you need to create content for each of your targeted audiences. No matter which business you are in, there will be different audiences you need to reach and each audience will be influenced differently. Creating customer personas is a great way to help break down the type of content each audience will need. Focus on demographics, needs, interests and locations.

Always look to your sales team for ideas on customer personas. They answer the questions people have and they understand the needs of the customers. Use their thoughts for ideation. Also examine your competition’s social media interactions, content development, and community to determine if there is an audience you may have forgotten.

Once you’ve decided who you want to reach, you will also want to take a close look at who you are connected with already. When you do, you can get an idea of who your content resonates with — and who you are missing. If you are missing a major segment of your ideal target audience, you can ask yourself why. You can use Google analytics for that.

What is LinkedIn Sales Navigator

LinkedIn Sales Navigator or “Sales Nav” as it’s frequently called, is a sales management tool, with access to LinkedIn’s vast network of over 740 million users.

Sales Navigator allows you to search for leads for business to business lead generation. It’s perfect if you need to find prospective customers based on your Ideal Customer Persona. You can indicate the exact types of prospective customers you’re looking for, using its search criteria. LinkedIn lead generation is made easy with filters like keywords, geography, your relationship (or how you’re connected to the prospect,) industry, school, profile language, first name, last name, and more.

From there, based on your LinkedIn Sales Navigator subscription, you can sync your data to the CRM of your choice, or reach out to the prospects of choice with a LinkedIn InMail.

With more advanced plans, you can also send content through LinkedIn which you can track for engagement, and even see your prospecting metrics at scale with their reporting feature.

Benefits of LinkedIn Sales Navigator
Biggest available B2B Network:

With one of the largest professional networks on earth, over 740 million prospects, LinkedIn has a serious advantage – being the social network of choice for business professionals to do business.

Because of this, LinkedIn Sales Navigator makes it possible to find almost anyone in B2B.
Advanced Updates:

LinkedIn Sales Navigator makes it not only easy to create prospect lists according to your Ideal Customer Persona, but receive updates on important LinkedIn activity. This could be anything like a change of jobs, a news mention of their company, and even more granular changes like when they LinkedIn post. This gives you a great reason to reach out and reconnect with prospects who have gone cold, or engage with new ones.
Excellent Search Features, List Creation, Saved Searches, and View Similar

These are some of the features that make the platform stand out. The sheer number of search filters makes it easy to find customers in your ICP with ease.

Additionally, the ability to save searches, have LinkedIn update you when new prospects are found for that saved list, and the ability to view “similar” prospects to those that you have just found, give you endless possibilities to find those potential prospects.
The Biggest Pitfalls of the Platform

The Biggest Pitfalls of the LinkedIn Sales Navigator platform, is that the number of InMails is incredibly limited, ranging between 20-50 per month, when the average SDR needs to average 60 calls a day to make numbers. Additionally, with only an 18% response rate, there’s simply not enough value in sending InMails to new prospects which may or may not accept your InMail request – leaving you (and your sales results) hanging.
LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Lusha Extension for LinkedIn

In order to maximize the value of LinkedIn Sales navigator, and to use it effectively, we recommend pairing it with Lusha Extension for LinkedIn.

Lusha Extension for LinkedIn is a Google Chrome Extension that allows you to solve the problem of “not enough LinkedIn Inmails” by allowing you to make a direct connection with your prospect. To Clarify: Lusha is not a LinkedIn product nor has any association with LinkedIn.

After downloading the Lusha Extension for LinkedIn, simply find the prospect you want to reach out to in LinkedIn. Next, click the Lusha extension and, in one click, Lusha will show you all available contact data it has in its database, including direct dials and email addresses. With this information, you can reach out and speak to prospects wherever they’re working from, and make a direct connection.

You can also export LinkedIn contacts and easily create prospecting lists for your marketing and sales teams.

From there, you can automatically save your prospect’s information into your CRM, like Hubspot, Zoho, or Salesforce, or Sales Automation tool of choice, like Outreach, Pipedrive, or Salesloft.

Lusha is the easiest way to find someone’s email address on LinkedIn, unless it’s in the About section of their LinkedIn profile. It’s fast, free to sign up for, with 5 free contact leads every single month. There are so many additional ways to earn free leads (we call them credits at Lusha,) that it makes it an absolute no-brainer. And, when paired in tandem with LinkedIn Sales Navigator, you get to experience the best of both worlds. Create lists of thousands of prospects with ease, and use Lush to supplement the missing contact data, make a direct connection, update your CRM, and speed up your sales cycle. Lusha Extension for LinkedIn combined with LinkedIn Sales Navigator is one of the most powerful sales prospecting tools, and the most effective way to conduct your .
Sales navigator professional vs. team vs. enterprise

With LinkedIn Sales Navigator, there are three plans you can choose from, professional, team, and Enterprise.

Sales Navigator Professional, Team, and Enterprise are all outlined above, including all of their features and an in-depth explanation of every feature, as of December 2021.

At a glance, here are the key differences between the three plans:

LinkedIn Sales Navigator Professional gives you all of the basic features, including the ability to perform advanced prospect searches based on advanced filters, create custom lists, and save searches. You also get 20 InMails a month.

LinkedIn Sales Navigator Team plans provide you with all of the features found in Pro, plus the ability to share content and track its engagement, as well as create “warm introductions” from teammates, which gets you one step closer to Mrs. Hard to Reach Prospect. Combined with 30 InMails a month.

LinkedIn Sales Navigator Enterprise provides you with all of the features found in Pro and Team plans, plus the added value of CRM updates, data validation, SSO, and advanced enterprise integrations. Add 50 InMails a month, with pricing that’s customized depending on the number of licenses and years you wish to purchase, and you’re sitting pretty with your prospecting.
Does LinkedIn Sales Navigator include LinkedIn Premium?

Yes, as of September 2021, LinkedIn made a decision to provide LinkedIn Sales Navigator users with Premium Career subscription at no additional cost. According to LinkedIn, LinkedIn Career allows you to get hired 2x as fast with its service, and claims that InMailing a recruiter using its Premium Career service is 2.6x as effective as email alone. It’s definitely a nice add on, and is great that it’s included in the price tag. Please note, that if you cancel your LinkedIn Sales Navigator subscription, you will also lose access to LinkedIn Premium Career.
Bottom Line – is  Sales Navigator worth it?

Bottom Line: LinkedIn Sales Navigator is a powerful prospecting tool, which leverages LinkedIn’s network of almost 750 million business contacts. With advanced search filters, saved searches, the ability to create lists, save thousands of prospects at once, receive updates based on prospect and account activity of your choosing, this is a prospecting tool that’s an excellent resource.

While it’s an excellent start to your prospecting, its main pitfalls lie in the fact that connection must be made through the LinkedIn platform, via InMail. With InMails in short supply, ranging between 20-50 per month per license, you’re going to need more than that to hit your numbers. Additionally, you’re restricted to the LinkedIn platform, which means a prospect can keep you at arm’s length, or just decide never to accept your InMail, leaving you out in the cold.

When you combine LinkedIn Sales Navigator with Lusha Extension for LinkedIn, you allow yourself to leverage the strength of the LinkedIn network, and supplement your prospecting efforts with Lusha’s accurate B2B contact data. Whether you want to call your prospect by direct dial or you choose to email them, as long as the information is in the Lusha database, it’s easy to prospect your way. Lusha is also free to sign up for, with no credit card needed, and provides 5 free leads a month, making it an attractive option to prospect in tandem with LinkedIn Sales Navigator.",https://www.lusha.com/blog/linkedin-sales-navigator/,Linkedin Sales Navigator

But what does it really bring to the table?

In practice, LinkedIn Sales Navigator offers improved search capabilities, increased visibility into extended contact networks, and personalized algorithms that make it possible for sales and marketing teams to reach the right decision-maker at target companies.

While the tool shares some features with Premium Business, Sales Navigator is purpose-built to help teams make the most of LinkedIn connections, find new contacts, and increase overall sales.

Specific benefits of Sales Navigator include:

    Searches for your target audience using advanced filters
    Recommended sales leads and update tracking
    Advanced filtering not available in any other LinkedIn version
    Job change alerts
    Specific keyword mentions
    Unlimited profile searches

Consider this last benefit — unlimited searches. While LinkedIn is a free social platform, the company does cap the number of profile searches you can do each month. Reach that limit and you’ll have to wait until searches roll over the next month. Sales Navigator removes this limitation and allows you to search as many profiles as necessary to achieve your sales goals.
Tier Overview: What You Get With Each

As noted above, Sales Navigator has three tiers: Professional, Team, and Enterprise.

LinkedIn Sales Navigator cost increases by tier — Professional is $79.99 per month with an annual subscription, and Team is $108.33 per month. For Enterprise pricing, you’ll need to contact LinkedIn directly.

Here’s a quick look at what you get with each tier.
Professional

Professional is the lowest-cost Sales Navigator option. It includes features such as advanced lead and company search, alerts on your sales leads and accounts, and the ability to create custom lists. Professional also integrates with popular sales tools such as SNAP, Outlook, and the Sales Navigator mobile app.
Team

Sales Navigator Team comes with all the features of Professional, along with the ability to share content and track engagement. You also get robust administrative tools and CRM platform syncing.
Enterprise

Enterprise takes your sales a step further with advanced CRM integrations. You get access to data validation and content creation tools, along with enterprise-level features such as single sign-on (SSO) for security and employee data integration for maximum sales impact.

Not sure if LinkedIn Sales Navigator is the right fit for your business? LinkedIn offers a 1-month free trial for members that aren’t on paid subscription plans and haven’t used any free trials in the last 365 days.

Lastly, the Sales Navigator app lets reps send InMail and messages on the go. Contacting a prospect quickly after a compelling event can mean the difference between winning and losing a deal, so this is a powerful feature.
3. Upgrade your profile.

It’s easier to stand out with a Sales Navigator Team or Enterprise account, since these come with a larger profile picture and background photo.

In addition, these users are displayed more prominently in search results. If a prospect searches for someone matching a rep’s description, that rep has a greater chance of catching her eye.
4. View similar prospects.

Sales Navigator search functions include the ability to suggest similar leads to ones you’re currently pursuing. Simply click the drop-down button on a lead you’re looking at and then click “View similar” — this will bring up a list of leads with similar job titles or roles. This is a great way to focus your sales efforts on decision-makers and reduce the amount of time spent trying to find the right person in a company.

    Finding prospects that have recently changed jobs
    Identifying contacts with shared connections

1. Integrate sales navigator with your HubSpot CRM.

LinkedIn has partnered with several CRM providers — HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce, Zoho, and Infor — to bring profile details and shared connections from Sales Navigator experience into your CRM.

That means as you’re doing your day-to-day in the CRM, you won't have to open a new tab (or three) to track down the lead or account in Sales Navigator. With a team account you can:

    Send InMail directly from a contact record
    View shared connections
    Ask mutual connections for introductions
    Add leads at the same company and add them to your Sales Navigator leads list
    Connect with people at an organization who have shared connections or interests
    Find out who you're already connected to in the organization

Here’s a sample of what that integration might look like, in the context of HubSpot CRM:

hubspot crm integration with linkedin sales navigator

Already using one of the CRMs that integrates with Sales Navigator? Set up the sync now. Using another CRM, or not using one at all? Fear not: LinkedIn will be expanding the universe of CRM integrations so stay tuned.

Note: To use HubSpot's integration with LinkedIn Sales Navigator, you must have a LinkedIn Sales Navigator Team or Enterprise account.
2. Apply the TeamLink filter.

According to LinkedIn, you’re more likely to leave a favorable impression with buyers if you were introduced to them by a mutual connection. With the TeamLink Connections filter, you can easily find the prospects who meet your search criteria and share an acquaintance with you, whether it’s a first or second-degree connection.

linkedin sales navigator team: teamlink filter

This filter taps the networks of the other members of your sales team and your first-degree connections.

Note: You must have a Team or Enterprise accounts to use TeamLink.
3. Save a TeamLink search.

Just because you don’t have a mutual connection with a prospect now doesn’t mean you never will. Your contacts form new connections every week. But it’s inefficient to manually run the same searches again and again in the hopes something has changed.

Fortunately, the “save search” feature lets you automate this step. Once you’ve defined your search parameters and applied the TeamLink filter, check the “Save Search” box.

linkedin sales navigator team: teamlink search

Image Source

Now, if one of your coworkers connects with one of your leads, you’ll be instantly notified.

Note: You must have a Team or Enterprise account to use TeamLink.
4. Check out the TeamLink section.

You can also check out the TeamLink section of an accounts page, which helps you build strategic relationships at an organization you’re targeting.

Let’s say you want to work with Blue Leaf. When you check out the TeamLink section of the Blue Leaf account page, TeamLink will display the current employees who are connected to members of your network. You can now ask those mutual connections for introductions.

linkedin sales navigator team: teamlink section

Note: You must have a Team or Enterprise accounts to use TeamLink.
5. Access the network of every person at your company.

TeamLink lets you tap into the connections of every Sales Navigator seatholder at your company. But that mostly limits you to salespeople, recruiters, and maybe your executives — after all, the average marketer, customer support rep, or finance associate isn't going to need an account.

With TeamLink Extend, these people can now opt-in to the Sales Navigator network. That means your pool of available contacts becomes much bigger.

The first 1,000 seats of TeamLink Extend come bundled free with every Enterprise Edition contract.
6. Create custom lists of your prospects to keep track of their status.

According to new research from Weidert Group, up to six different people are now involved in every B2B purchasing decision.

To effectively work an account, you need to keep track of who’s involved in the buying process, form connections with them, and identify their unique objectives and priorities. It’s no small feat.

Sales Navigator helps streamline this information by allowing you to create lists and filter leads based on the criteria you set. Once you’ve identified a relevant contact, you use keywords to show you only contacts who fit those criteria. You can then easily export this LinkedIn Sales Navigator list and import it to your CRM or outreach tool for further action.

linkedin sales navigator team: custom lists

Image Source
7. Use the “Interested In” filter to find ways of providing value.

Finding ways to add value to your prospects’ lives isn’t always easy. Thanks to the “Interested In” filter, you can instantly figure out which buyers need your help — which will give you a major advantage when reaching out.

For example, you can run a search for “mid-level marketing managers” and further narrow down the pool with the “Interested In: Industry experts” filter. Every prospect the search returns has self-indicated they’d like to meet industry experts. You can volunteer your own expertise, offer to connect them with a specialist inside your company, or introduce them to an external contact.

8. Use advanced filters to identify your ideal customers.

Thanks to Sales Navigator’s advanced filters, salespeople can hone in on specific prospect types. These include:

    Exclude saved, viewed, or contacted leads
    Company type: Public, private, or nonprofit (Also available in LinkedIn Premium)
    Groups (Also available in LinkedIn Premium)
    Years in current position
    Years at current company
    Years of experience (Also available in LinkedIn Premium)
    Member since (Also available in LinkedIn Premium)
    Headquarter
    Seniority level (Also available in LinkedIn Premium)
    Posted content keywords

If you’re not quite sold on this feature yet, LinkedIn provides a full list of the advanced search filters.
9. Target high-value accounts.

Sales and Marketing, good news: Working together on LinkedIn campaigns is easier than ever before, thanks to an integration between Sales Navigator and Campaign Manager.

Like before, marketers are responsible for ad creative, budget, and timeline. Yet now, they can target the leads and accounts their sales reps are pursuing — meaning your messaging and value prop will be top-of-mind when you're engaging with potential customers.

Marketing can even take advantage of lookalike modeling, so they can find and market to users similar to existing prospects and customers.

Salespeople can see exactly how their prospects are engaging with marketing content and will even get alerts when a saved account has read, liked, or shared their company's sponsored content.
10. Leverage shared interests.

One of the best ways to encourage more sales? Finding something in common to start the conversation. LinkedIn Sales Navigator streamlines this process with the “Share experiences with you” filter that shows you leads that have shared interests listed on their profile. These shared interests provide a great jumping-off point for conversations that go beyond basic cold calls and emails, in turn making it easier to jumpstart the sales process.

1. Build rapport With “Shared Experiences and Commonalities”.

Sales Navigator already allows users to save leads, but the “Share experiences with you” filter makes it easier to surface opportunities within that database. The filter gives you a strong foundation for building rapport by pulling together all the prospects who have at least one thing in common with you: Maybe you both lived in Manhattan at one point, worked for the same company, volunteered with the same nonprofit, or have another point of commonality.

Mentioning this point of similarity when you reach out (either in your email subject line, the message body, or in your voicemail) will boost your chances of getting a response.
2. Unlock out-of-network user profiles.

The unlock feature, which is available with Sales Navigator Team, lets reps view the full profile of a user outside of their network. Once they’ve unlocked a profile, everyone on their Sales Navigator team can see it.

Every team member can unlock up to 25 profiles per month. To do so, click the blue “Unlock member profile” button in the top section of a member’s profile.
3. Refine your lead and account recommendations.

Sales Navigator can help reps keep their pipeline full with automatic lead and account recommendations. To make sure their recommendations align as closely as possible with their buyer personas, salespeople should take advantage of the tool’s Sales Preferences. These criteria include region, industry, function, and seniority level.

To add or modify these settings, click your profile picture in the top right corner and choose “Settings.”

Then scroll down to the Sales Preferences section, type your choices, and click “Done.”

refine lead account recommendations in linkedin sales navigator

Sales Preferences only apply to lead and account recommendations, meaning regular searches include results that fall outside of a user’s saved choices. For instance, a rep might ask for recommendations for executive assistants in California, but simply searching “executive assistant” could generate prospects that live elsewhere.
4. Validate your CRM data.

""Clean data"" might not be the most glamorous two-word string in the English language, but it's critical to a high-functioning sales org. Without up-to-date, accurate information on leads, prospects, and customers, it's much harder for a rep to build rapport, earn credibility, add value, and eventually win the business.

That's why LinkedIn's Data Validation feature is so great. It automatically updates contact data in your CRM in real time. Maybe you're in the early stages of your sales process when your main contact leaves the company. Because he updates his title, the record in your CRM changes too.

5. Upload your book of business to Sales Navigator.

If you’re just starting out with LinkedIn Sales Navigator, you may already have a list of contacts that you’re working with. Now, LinkedIn lets you upload that CSV list into Sales Navigator so you can seamlessly connect with your leads all in one place.

If you’ve had trouble closing a deal or if there are more stakeholders in the approval process, you can uncover insights that will help you prioritize those contacts and plan your next steps to engage with them. You’ll also get alerts regarding updates at the company so you never miss a beat.
6. Generate interest with InMail.

LinkedIn Sales Navigator gives you access to InMail – LinkedIn’s version of email or direct messages. InMail is only available to Sales Navigator subscribers, meaning your prospects likely see far fewer InMails than typical emails.

The result? If you can stand out from the crowd by finding a shared interest or offering a unique viewpoint, InMail makes it possible to boost your connective impact.
7. Create a custom outreach message.

Speaking of impact, one great way to do this in LinkedIn Sales Navigator is by creating a custom outreach message. First, run an advanced LinkedIn search to get details about your sales target’s industry, location, and market niche.

Then, send something like this connection request template:


“Hi, {first_name}, I’m reaching out to grow our network of {your_industry} leaders.

Here in {your_city}, we’re exploring some great opportunities in {your_industry_niche}, and it would be great to connect with you and share what we’ve learned.”
send-now-hubspot-sales-bar

Adjust the details to match your needs, but make best use of the {} filters available in LinkedIn to create quick and easy templates you can quickly send to multiple leads. Worth noting? Connection — not conversion — is the goal of these initial InMails, so you’re best served by aiming for a natural, conversational tone over something more sales-focused.
Prospect Better With LinkedIn Sales Navigator

LinkedIn is a B2B sales and marketing powerhouse, and Sales Navigator gives your team critical insights to make the most of it. Whether you’re a team of one or part of an established enterprise, this tool has features to help you close deals with a human-centered perspective. There’s no more guessing or sending cold emails to the wrong decision-maker. LinkedIn Sales navigator unlocks the secrets to closing deals that the best prospectors and sales professionals swear by.

What is Sales Navigator, what are it's key features and how can I get started.

Sales Navigator is LinkedIn’s flagship product for sales teams, enabling reps, managers, and ops leaders to inform their approaches and strategies by taking advantage of the full breadth of LinkedIn’s expansive data, insight, and relationship-building tools.

If you’re looking to gain a clear grasp of exactly what Sales Navigator offers, how it works, how to best maximize its value, and how it enables Buyer First Selling, you’ve come to the right place.
What Is LinkedIn Sales Navigator?

Sales Navigator is a deep sales platform that enables virtual selling by allowing sales professionals to build and maintain relationships with their buyers at scale. Sales Navigator is designed to be a centerpiece and fixture for modern B2B sales teams, integrating with other sales technologies (such as CRM) to provide a foundation of trusted, reliable, real-time data.

Sales Navigator is the best version of LinkedIn for sales professionals. It features a powerful set of search capabilities, improved visibility into extended networks, and personalized algorithms to help you reach the right decision-maker at the right time.
What Does Sales Navigator Do?

At its core, Sales Navigator helps sales professionals successfully perform three of the most critical functions involved with their discipline.

    Target: Quickly identify and learn about people and companies that are a likely fit for your product or service.
    Understand: Track key developments at target accounts, such as decision-makers changing jobs or indicators of buying intent, to act on opportunities as they arise.
    Engage: Connect and converse with prospects within a ready-to-do-business environment while tapping into the full extent of LinkedIn’s messaging and content-sharing capabilities.

In a new era of selling where putting the buyer first is paramount and virtual interactions are becoming the norm, Sales Navigator equips salespeople to lead with insight, deliver value that differentiates, and build relationships that fuel customer acquisition.

That allows them to build deeper, more meaningful relationships.
Key Features in Sales Navigator (and How to Use Them)

How can Sales Navigator strengthen the efforts of you and your team on a day-to-day basis? These are some of the key features that users leverage most:

    Extended Network Access: Sales Navigator allows sellers to realize the full power of LinkedIn’s global network of professionals, with unlimited searches (which can be saved for ongoing efficiencies), and more.
    Advanced Searching Tools: Customize your settings and let Sales Navigator work for you. With Advanced search filters and Sales Preferences, you indicate what types of leads you want to see based on region, industry, function, and seniority level. Using these preferences, the platform will begin to surface account and lead recommendations automatically. Learn more about search here.
    Prioritize and Qualify Opportunities:  Your Sales Navigator searches will automatically highlight noteworthy results via Sales Spotlights, calling out individuals who have recently changed jobs, or share common experiences with you (school, past employer, LinkedIn Group), or have posted new content recently.
    Outreach and Messaging: LinkedIn’s native messaging tool, InMail, is available to all users, but Sales Navigator provides more opportunities to use InMail to spark quick, personalized conversations with new prospects. Learn how to be great at InMailing here.
    Keep Track of People and Companies: Save your most promising accounts and leads to receive real-time updates and alerts. You can also build Custom Lists and record notes to share across the team. Learn more about LinkedIn Alerts here.

Relationship-building with Sales Navigator

In the new era of selling, relationships are everything. Empowered buyers want to work with individuals they know and trust. Sellers who convey authentic intentions, deliver genuine value, and develop strong rapport are poised to take the lead.

The problem, of course, is that building real relationships takes time and effort. Making it happen across a sizable pool of prospects is all but impossible without a technological assist. Sales Navigator enables sales professionals to build relationships at scale. When you save leads or contacts, the platform will automatically notify you of important moments and milestones, opportunities for timely outreach, and noteworthy developments at the account.

Here are a few examples of ways you can take advantage of tools in Sales Navigator to facilitate efficient and effective relationship-building, all of which are highlighted in Relationship Explorer:

    A prospect starts a job at a new company. Maybe you hadn’t spoken with this saved lead in a while. The “Lead Career Change” alert informs you of the move, prompting you to send a message and check in on to see how the transition is going. Suddenly, you have a new potential prospect account on your radar.
    A prospect engages with content from your LinkedIn Page. You send over an InMail or Smart Links presentation with additional information and insight on the topic, concluding with an open-ended question to compel further conversation.
    A prospect shares a personal story via their LinkedIn profile. You’re notified of a “Lead Share” and the story strikes a chord. You send an InMail or leave a comment adding your own reaction or perspective. The prospect appreciates a genuine interaction, with no sales intent, and trust is strengthened.

These examples merely scratch the surface of what sales professionals are able to do through Sales Navigator’s expansive set of features and capabilities. And because all of your outreach and interactions are being informed by trusted, high-quality, up-to-date data, you minimize the risk of getting details about them and their company wrong — cited in the State of Sales 2021 report as one of the top deal-breakers in the eyes of buyers.

“sales manager” AND “software” AND “New York“.

However, for this kind of query, you will be limited to the LinkedIn basic search, as LinkedIn won’t let you use complex Boolean expressions.

They want you to buy Sales Navigator for that.
